natural resource management giz india mr akhil dev junior technical expert natural resource management giz indiafarmers handbook on basic agricultureacknowledgement higher demand for agricultural raw material is now anticipated and agriculture is not any more about producing farm products and selling them exclusively at the local market instead farmers today have a world market to serve but the new chances bring new challenges farmers and agricultural enterprises willing to be part of the new expanding world market not only have to take into consideration customers preferences whom they want to serve but also adhere to international trade regulations set by wto and comply with high production and quality standards required by the importing countries agriculture contributes around 17 to gdp and continues to be among the most important and success ful sectors in india around 58 of the indian population depend on agriculture for their livelihood apart from delivering the local industries with top quality raw materials for processing agriculture provides almost 10 of total export earnings however to support the impressive indian economic growth in the coming years agriculture will have to contribute more towards value addition productivity enhancement high quality products and trained manpower to successfully tackle these challenges the states of gujarat and maharashtra have competitive advantages for the production of several com modities however productivity and competitiveness remains low rising quality requirements of export and domestic markets require an upscaling of the production which is only feasible with educated farmers and skilled workers desai fruits and vegetables dfvin cooperation with the deutsche gesellschaft fr internationale zusammenarbeitgiz gmbh on behalf of the german federal ministry for economic cooperation and development bmz takes up the existing education gap by implementing a development partnership called partnership farming india the goal of partnership farming india pfi is to enable farmers to be selfsufficient decisionmakers agripreneurs which allows for a more flexible production system and highlights farming as profession by choice and not by inheritance furthermore pfi strengthens farmers and farm workers management skills to adopt modern agricul tural practices and concepts and enhance the international competitiveness of smallholders agricultural produce by giving farmers and workers in gujarat and maharashtra access to practical agricultural educa tion therefore dfv and giz in close cooperation with the national institute of agricultural extension management manage an organization of ministry of agriculture government of india developed the training material on basic agricultural knowledge and skills the states of gujarat and maharashtra will serve as an example on how to establish long term successful and trustful business relationships by combining small scale production in the field with large scale processing and marketing i am confident that this effort will serve the indian agriculture as a replicable model make lasting contributions towards sustainable agriculture and prosperous farmers i would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people and institutions namely manage dfv and gizwhich supported this project and enabled making information available this is a useful source of information for farmers trainers and other interested persons to improve not only the agriculture but also the livelihood of the farming community mrs sabine preuss gizindia programme director natural resource management farmers handbook on basic agriculture preface agriculture is an important sector of indian economy as more than half of its population relies on ag riculture as principle source of income research and extension systems play major role in generation and dissemination of agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers the extension system adopts series of extension methods such as training demonstration exposure visit to transfer the technologies from lab to land majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop specific technologies and mostly on solution to problem basis however there is a need for equipping the farmers with basic knowledge of agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level for taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies in view of this desai fruits and vegetables pvt ltd dfv india in cooperation with the deutsche gesellschaft fr internationale zusammenarbeit giz gmbh on behalf of the german federal ministry for economic cooperation and development bmz in close cooperation with national institute of ag ricultural extension management manage an organization of ministry of agriculture government of india brought out farmers handbook on basic agriculture to impart technical knowledge on basic agriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific agriculture this handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various stakeholders such as researchers academicians extension functionaries agripreneurs master trainers and farmers based on the identified needs the topics were prioritized and contents were developed with the help of experts the farmerfriendly content has been written in simple language using more pictures with practical examples for the benefit of farmers the book contains six chapters each focusing on a particular topic the first chapter general conditions for cultivation of crops talks about the basic needs of farmers and farming sector by providing basic knowledge on good agricultural practices gap enhancing the awareness of farmers on critical factors in selection of crops and cropping patterns judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water and emphasizing the importance of mechanization in the field of agriculture the second chapter soil and plant nutrition is aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of farmers about soil its structure physical chemical biological properties soil fertility and managing the soil fertility in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner it also focuses on the need for soil testing plant nutrition requirement organic inorganic fertilizers and integrated nutrient manage ment inm for efficient economic and sustainable production of crops the third chapter of the book is about pest management and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and understanding among farmers about the crop pests diseases and weed management through integrated pest management it also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection equipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on occupational health and safety of farmers it creates awareness about causes preventive measures of health hazards risks fatalities in agriculture and use of first aid in emergencies it further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and fatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers time and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity be it service sector busi ness or daytoday activities of life farming sector too has not remained untouched by it therefore the fourth chapter of the book is devoted to farm management it is to educate and equip the farmers to make proper plans take appropriate decisions and also to take advantage of the improved technologies to increase production assure food security for the family and market opportunities to increase income considering available resources anticipated risks including market fluctuations farmers access to services the last chapter of the book aims at enhancing awareness among farmers about sources of extension information and services public and private extension services agricultural credit insurance and legal aspects through information communication technologies the content is useful not only for farmers but also for other stakeholders involved in farm advisory services such as agri input dealers agripreneurs kisan call centers and extension functionaries working at grass roots level we trust that this handbook will benefit maximum number of farmers to make farming economically and environmentally more sustainable b srinivas ias director general manage farmers handbook on basic agriculture contents 1 general conditions for

ing ample technologies to improve the productivity and profitability of the farmers how many of these technologies are reaching the farmers baseline situation assessment conducted by partner ship farming in india in gujarat and maharashtra clearly indicated that farmers with access to technical knowledge on agriculture realized better income compared to others fifty one percent of sample farmers who were part of partnership farming india had knowledge of soil testing compared to only 28 of control group mulching and intercropping as a practice were not widely adopted by control group of farmers they were less aware about other organic fertilizers fertigation as a method of application of fertilizers was not widely practiced by control group farmers who accessed information from agricultural universities and magazines were less in number in the control group the treatment farmers had an average yield of 3565 tons and control farmers had yield of 2236 tons of banana per acre the average net income of the treatment farmers was rs 93822 and for the control farmers rs81659 more than 85 of the farmers wanted basic education on agriculture and crop production and ready to pay for undergoing such basic education and training there was a clear interest in the farmers to improve their skill and knowledge and they were ready to pay for the servicethe above study clearly indicates that the knowledge gap is prevailing among farmers and those who have access to knowledge harvested better profits increase in productivity and profitability can be achieved through blending practical knowledge with scientific technologies efficient use of natural resources adopting time specific management practices giving priority for quality driven production adopting suitable farming systems adoption of location specific technology market demand driven production adopting low cost and no cost technologies1 general conditions for cultivation of crops 11 objectives of the session to enhance awareness of farmers on critical factors in selection of crops and cropping patterns to create an understanding on judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water to provide basic knowledge on seed and cropping systems to emphasize the importance of mechanization to sensitize the farmers on good agricultural practices gap 12 what do we know at the end of the session critical

of proposed crops farmers need to answer all the above questions while making decisions for choosing a crop cropping pattern during this decision making process farmer cross check the suitability of proposed cropcropping systems with his existing resources and other conditions thereby they justify choosing or rejecting a cropcropping systems this process enables the farmers to undertake a swot analysis internally which in turn guides them to take an appropriate decision 14 climatic factors climate and agriculture monsoon is a key source of water in agriculture most of our rivers are seasonal fed by the monsoon even irrigated agriculture depends on monsoon cropping pattern has evolved over years based on climate market forces influence cropping patterns in recent times climatic factors and crops rainfall drives water availability and deter mines sowing time rainfed crops temperature drives crop growth duration and influences milk production in animals temperature and relative humidity influence pest and diseases incidence on crops livestock and poultry wet and dry spells cause significant impact on standing crops physiology loss of economic products eg fruit drop

kharif supports most of the rainfed crops coarse cereals pulses oilseeds etc postrainy octoberfebruary season also known as rabi supports the irrigated or stored moisture grown crops wheat mustard chickpea etc summer season marchmay supports short duration pulses and vegetables rabi production is more assured has a higher yield and reduces pest and disease related problems over time with irrigation development the contribution of kharif is declining and rabi is increasinggeneral conditions for cultivation of crops farmers handbook on basic agriculture 5climate cropping pattern and agricul tural production issues cropping patterns based on climate and land capability are sustainable but market forces and farmers aspirations are forcing unsustainable systems farmers must innovate in producing more even from less endowed areas by adopting suitable technologies to cope with changing climate climate change will likely to cause further problems in our crop production and is likely to become the most important environmental issue in the 21st century important agricultural related factors responsible for climate change deforestation and forest degradation burning of fuel and farm waste water logged condition excessive use of external input largescale conversion of land for nonagricul tural purpose impact of climate change in india rainfall no longterm trend noted however regional variations seen increased summer rainfall and less number of rainy days temperature about 06 c rise in surface tem perature during 100 years projected to increase 35 to 5 c by 2100 carbon dioxide increasing at the rate of 19 ppm per year and expected to reach 550 ppm by 2050 and 700 ppm by 2100 extreme events increased frequency of heat wave cold wave droughts and floods observed during last decade rising sea level rise of 25 mmyear since 1950 glaciers rapid melting of the glaciers in the himalayas rainfall distribution shift in peak rainfall distribution also noticed in some parts of country expected impact of climate change on agriculture due to increase in temperature crop may re quire more water yield may be reduced in cereal crops especially in rabi ie wheat impact of drought impact of flood heat wave on maize cold wave damage to chana harvest6 general conditions for cultivation of crops farmers handbook on basic agriculture change in pest and disease scenario due to climate change due to increase in rainfall pests like bollworm red hairy caterpillar and leaf spot diseases may increasedue to increase in temperature sucking pests such as mites and leaf miner may increase due to variation in rainfall and temperature pest and diseases of crops to be altered because of more enhanced pathogen and vector development rapid pathogen transmission and increased host susceptibility sometimes a minor pest may become a major pest agricultural biodiversity is also threatened by decreased rainfall and increased temperature sea level rise and increased frequency and se verity of drought cyclone and flood quality of farm products such as fruits vegetables tea coffee aromatic and medicinal plants may be affected water demand for irrigation to increase with increased temperature and higher amount of evapotranspiration this may result in lower ing of groundwater table at some places the melting of glaciers in the himalayas will increase water availability in the ganga brahmaputra and their tributaries in the shortrun but in the longrun the availability of water will decrease considerably a significant increase in runoff is projected in the rainy season however may not be very beneficial unless storage infrastructure could be vastly expanded this extra water in the rainy season on the other hand may lead to increase in frequency and duration of floods the water balance in different parts of india will be disturbed and the quality of ground water along costal track will be more affected due to intrusion of sea water soil organic matter content which is already quite low in indian soil would become even lower quality of soil organic matter may be affected reduction in rate of decomposition and nutrient supply increase in soil temperature may reduce nitrogen availability due to volatilization and denitrification change in rainfall volume and frequency as well as wind may alter the severity frequency and extent of soil erosion rise in sea level may lead to salt water entry in the coastal lands turning them less suitable for conventional agriculture livestock affect feed production and nutrition of livestock increased temperature would reduce digestibility increased water scarcity would also decrease the food and fodder production major impacts on vectorborne diseases through expansion of vector populations dur ing rainy years leading to large outbreaks of diseases increase water shelter and energy requirement of livestock for meeting projected milk demands climate change is likely to aggravate heat stress in dairy animals adversely affecting their reproductive performance fishery increased sea and river water temperature is likely to affect fish breeding migration and har vest impacts of increased temperature and tropical cyclonic activity would affect capture production and marketing costs of the marine fish coping options for farmers access to information progressive

general conditions for cultivation of crops farmers handbook on basic agriculture 15 soil and water conservation soil and water are our precious heritage hence it is obligatory on our part to protect and hand over these resources to further generations it is estimated that about 50 of the cultivated area in india suffers from severe soil erosion and requires remedial measures water resources are essential for increasing and stabilizing crop production wind erosion has been responsible for destroying the valuable top soil 151 degradation of soil and water takes place with water and wind erosion the main cause of water erosion is unmanaged runoff runoff is the portion of the rainfall or irrigation water applied which leaves a field either as surface or as subsurface flow several factors are responsible for runoff climatic factors precipitation characteristics duration intensity distribution direction temperature humidity wind velocity watershed characteristics geological shape of the catchments size and shape of the catchments topography drainage pattern barren land without vegetation soil types sandy soil average rain no problem of erosion high intensity more serious of less binding material ie fine soil particle clay soil ordinary rain more runoff in moderate and steep slopes but high water holding capacity silt loam loamy and fine sandy loam more desirable soils from the point of view of minimizing soil erosion how vegetation reduces runoff interception of rainfall root structure biological influences transpiration effects intercept absorb the impact of raindrop hindrance to runoff water slows down the rate at which travels down the slope knitting and binding effect aggregates the soil into granules die and decay increase pore space and water holding capacity one cubic meter of soil has several kilometres of root fibre more vegetative cover most active soil fauna channels of earth worm beetles and other life vegetation increases the storage capacity of the soil for rainfall by the transpiration of large quantities of moistures from the soil soil erosion soil erosion is the detachment and transportation of soil material from one place to another through the action of wind water in motion or by the hitting action of the rain drops when the vegetation is removed and land is put under cultivation the natural equilibrium between soil building and soil removal is disturbed the removal of surface soil takes place at a much faster rate than it can be built up by the soil forming process erosion by water known as water erosion is the removal of soil from the lands surface by water in motion sheet erosion the removal of a thin relatively uniform layer of soil particles by the action of rainfall and runoff extremely harmful usually so slow that the farmer is not conscious of its existence common on lands having a gentle uniform slope results in the uniform removal of the cream of the top soil with every heavy rain shallow top soil overlies a tight sub soil are most susceptible to sheet erosion movement of soil by rain drop splash is the primary cause of sheet erosion sheet erosion has damaged millions of hectares of slopping land throughout the india rill erosion is the removal of soil by running wa ter with the formation of shallow channels that can be smoothed out completely by normal cultivation there is no sharp lines of demarcation where sheet erosion and rill erosion begins but rill erosion is more readily apparent than sheet erosiongeneral conditions for cultivation of crops farmers handbook on basic agriculture 11 rills develop when there is a concentration of runoff water which if neglected grow into large gullies more serious in soils having a loose shallow top soil transition stage between sheet erosion and gullying gully erosion removal of soil by running wa ter with the formation of channels that cannot be smoothed out completely by cultivation advance stage of rill erosion any concentration of surface runoff is a potential source of gullying cattle paths cart tracks dead furrows tillage furrows or other small depression down a slope favour concentration of flow unattended rills deepen and widen every year and begin to attain the form of gullies unattended gullies may result over a few years for an entire landscape to be filled with a network of gullies more spectacular than other type of erosions stream channel erosion erosion caused by stream flow closely resembles rill erosion intensive channel erosion areas are on the outside of lands where flow shear stresses are high mass movement enmass movement of soil landslides land slips soil and mudflows are various forms of mass movement wind erosion movement of soil particles is caused by wind force exerted against or parallel to surface of the ground 152 conservation conservation is the utilization without wastage of resources is required to ensure a high level of production important soil conservation measures are conservation tillage minimum tillage zero tillage stubble mulching trash farmingsheet and rill erosion landslide gully erosion shelterbelts for moderating microclimate12 general

practices to control soil blowing deep ploughing summer ploughing surface roughness conserving moisture wind breaks and shelterbelts mechanical or vegetative barriers for instance shelterbelts for moderating microclimate shelterbelts reduce wind velocity moderate temperature reduce evaporative loss and conserve soil moisture water erosion can be managed by in situ water harvesting summer ploughing overland flow management contour bund graded bund broad based bund bench terrace water harvesting and recycling zero tillage several practices are in use such as zero till age minimum tillage and direct seeding planting crops in previously untilled soil by opening a narrow slot trench or band only of sufficient width and depth to obtain seed coverage no other soil tillage is done advantages of zero tillage farming erosion control retained stubble and crop residue reduces soil erosion and enhances soil fertility moisture conservation stubble traps water reduce runoff water better infiltration leading to improved soil moisture condition higher nitrogen availability seedling protection stubbles protects young seedling from wind and heat crop yields will be on par with traditional tillage system however good yield can be harvested during dry years reduce labour and save time savings on equipment cost savings on oilfuel cost mulching benefits of crop residue mulch ing are increased availability of water and organic matter less erosion environment protection additional benefit to farmers less drought susceptibility improved soil quality and fertilizer efficiency

growth when rainfall is not sufficient the plants must receive additional water from irrigation points consider for irrigation decisions land suitability for irrigation like slope effective rainfall part of the total rain is useful for crop production when to irrigate decide based on soil crop and climatic condition how much to irrigate decide based on crop water requirement how to irrigate select appropriate method for irrigation quality of irrigation water 161 various methods can be used to supply irrigation water to the plants surface irrigation basin irrigation furrow irrigation sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation surface irrigation surface irrigation is the application of water by gravity flow to the surface of the field either the entire field is flooded basin irrigation or the water is fed into small channels furrows or strips of land borders basin irrigation basins are flat areas of land surrounded by low bunds the bunds prevent the water from flowing to the adjacent fields basin irrigation is commonly used for rice grown on flat lands or in terraces on hillsides paddy grows best when its roots are submerged in water hence basin irrigation is the best method to use for this kind of crop trees can also be grown in basins where one tree is usually located in the middle of a small basin in general the basin method is suitable for crops that are no affected by standing in water for longer periods basin irrigation is suitable for many field crops crops suitable for basin irrigation include pastures citrus banana and crops that are broadcasted such as cereals and to some extent row crops such as tobacco basin irrigation is generally not suited to crops which cannot stand in wet or water logged conditions for periods longer than 24 hours eg potatoes beet root and carrots the flatter the land surface the easier it is to construct basins it is also possible to construct basins on sloping land even when the slope is quite steep level basins called terraces can be constructed like the steps of a staircase soils suitable for basin irrigation depend on the crop grown basin should be small if the slope of the land is steep soil is sandy stream size to the basin is small required depth of the irrigation application is small field preparation is done by hand or animal power basin can be large if the slope of the land is gentle or flat soil is clay stream size to the basin is large required depth of the irrigation application is large field preparation is mechanized the land slope the soil type the available stream size the required depth of the ir rigation application and farming practices mainly determine the shape and size of basins if the land slope is steep the basin should be narrow otherwise too much earth movement will be needed to obtain level basins three other factors which may affect basin width are depth of fertile soil method of basin construction agricultural practices there are two methods to supply irrigation water to basins i the direct method ir rigation water is led directly from the field channel into the basin through siphons 14 general conditions for cultivation of crops farmers handbook on basic agriculture or bund breaks ii the cascade method irrigation water is supplied to the highest terrace and then allowed to flow to a lower terrace and so on maintenance of basins bunds are susceptible to erosion this may be caused by for example rainfall flood or the passing of people when used as footpaths rats may dig holes in the sides of the bunds therefore it is important to check the bunds regularly notice defects and repair them instantly before greater damage is done advantages of basin irrigation conservation of rainfall and reduction in soil erosion high water application and distribution efficiencies useful in leaching of salts suitable to all close growing crops row crops and orchards furrow irrigation furrows are small channels which carry water down the land slope between the crop rows water infiltrates into the soil as it moves along the slope the crop is usually grown on the ridges between the furrows this method is suitable for all row crops and for crops that cannot stand in water for long periods crops such as maize sunflower sugarcane and soybean can be irrigated by furrow irrigation crops that would be damaged by inundation such as tomatoes vegetables potatoes beans fruit trees like citrus and grape as well as broadcasted crops like wheat irrigation water flows from the field channel into the furrows by opening up the bank of the channel or by means of siphons or spiles furrows must be on consonance with the slope soil type stream size irrigation depth cultivation practice and field length uniform flat or gentle slopes are preferred for furrow irrigation on undulating land furrows should follow the land contours advantages of furrow irrigation suitable for row crops and vegetables suitable for soils in which the infiltration rates vary between 05 and 25 cmhr ideal for slopes varying from 02 to 05 per cent and a stream size of 12 literssec in areas requiring surface drainage or prone to temporary water logging furrows are very effective in areas where water for irrigation purposes is scarce the practice of alternate or skip furrow irrigation can save considerable quantity of water without significantly affecting yields

soil provides not only the medium but also functions as the source of these nutrients for the plants soil resources get depleted with every harvest and need to be replenished for every crop however one must know which nutrients are to what extent depleted and what addition of fertilizers should be planned accordingly soil analysis in this regard helps in determining the level of nutrients and in deciding the required amount of fertilizer application accuracy of soil analysis is directly relat ed to the quality of the soil sample taken application of appropriate fertilizers with the proper nutrient mix will help not only to increase the productivity and farm income but also provide a more realistic chance to obtain the desired yield there are various methods for taking a soil sample

offered to the crop or plants plant analysis identifies how well the plants utilizes the soil nutrients and applied nutrients plant analysis allows the plant to tell us what nutrients it needs it is critical that the correct plant part and stage of growth be sampled the normal nutrient concentration differs between the various plant parts also the normal nutrient concentration of each plant part changes as the plant matures it is important to keep these factors in mind to assess the nutrients status of plants the plant parts required to be collected for different crops are as follows crop

related to the concentration of calcium plus magnesium are referred to as residual sodium carbonate rsc content of anions such as chloride sulphate and nitrate methods of water sample collection as water quality and suitability plays an important role in deciding production and productivity of crops farmers are advised consult extension worker to test the water nutrient requirement and productivity keeping soil fertility and soil nutrients at optimum level helps increasing the productiv ity of the soil although the ability of the soil to supply the plants with the required nutrients depends also on the soil condition like ie soil texture soil structure and soil organic matter therefore soil fertility management does not only include nutrient management but also soil condition management apart from other soil management practices soil fertility focuses on maintain a balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient application adequate fertility for the plants at the specific growth stages soil fertility and organic matter maintenance minimizing the nutrient loss by avoiding excess application46 soil and plant nutrition farmers handbook on basic agriculture the soil nutrient demand usually is based on soil nutrient level crop variety and yielding ability soil moisture targeted yield soil analysis direct the farmer on quantity and qual ity of fertilisers to be used farmers can get the crop specific nutrient fertilizer recommendations after consulting the local extension service or their desaitrainer and discussing with them the soil analysis report c recommended fertilizer dose for important cropsgeneral considerations before fertilizer applica tion nutrients and not fertilizers should be bought think nutrients not fertilizers each nutrient applied as fertilizer should give a desired production response the cost of fertilization must be calculated on the basis of applied plant nutrients per unit area of land calculate one nutrient at a

diseases and pathogens increased rate of soil organic matter decomposition resulting in soil degradation many nutrients applied are easily lost through different chemical reactions organic fertilizers advantages balanced nutrient supply enhance the soil biological activity help in improving soil structure increase the organic matter content slow release of nutrients makes soil on the long run fertile help in combating plant diseases disadvantages low nutrient content only effective in the long run it may not supply all the nutrients required for plant growth high cost bulkiness efficient fertilizer use good knowledge and management practices can improve the fertilizer use efficiency select the crops and varieties that suit the locality and have best fertilizer response select right kind of fertilizer according to crop and soil the fertilization should be planned for the cropping pattern and not for single crops fertilization application rate should be decided only after discussing your soil analysis report with your local extension officer or desaitrainer balanced fertilization should be practiced crops should only be sown at the locally recommended periods maintain optimum plant population and proper plant spacing effective control of pests and diseases will help in maximizing the fertilizer efficiency to maximize the yield increase through fertilizer all other growth critical factors must also be optimum eg crop must be irrigated at critical growth stagesfertilizer application methods broadcasting fertilizer is distributed manually over the cropped field the most common fertilizer application method highly inefficient method high economic and nutrient losses placement application in band or packets near the plants two subtypes i band application ii spot application the fertilizer use efficiency is high labour intensive efficient method but with high labour inputbroadcasting placement48 soil and plant nutrition farmers handbook on basic agriculture ring application spread the fertilizer around the tree at a distance of about one meter foliar application liquid fertilizers are sprayed on the crops highly efficient special equipment required high cost only selected fertilizers can be applied fertigation along with irrigation method of application and nutrients the method of application should be chosen ac cording to the nutrient crop soil and cultivation method nitrogen application should be applied in splits and slow release mode to minimize loss frequent application in small quantity through foliar application is most efficient and results in quick recovery of crops use slow release nitrogen for plantation crops and long duration crops under puddle condition use coated ureaneem oil coal tar sulphur coating will make urea to release nitrogen slow to match the uptake pattern urea can be cured with soil 1 part urea with 510 parts soil to reduce the losses phosphate should be placed 4 to 6 cm below and 4 to 6 cm away from the seeds to ensure maximum availability phosphatic fertilizers give better response when placed in bands near the plant rows potassic fertilizers can be applied in one dose as basal application but for long duration crops the fertilizer application may be done in 2 to 3 splits fertilizer calculations here is an example for the application of fertilizers based on the soil test recommendations suppose the recommendations are 120 kg n 60 kg p and 40 kg k per ha calculate the quantity of urea super phosphate and muriate of potash fertilizers needed to supply the recommended doses urea content is 46 so to supply 46 kg nha 100 kg urea is required to supply 120 kg nha 100461202609 or 261 kg urea is required similarly super phosphate content is 16 p2o5 and the recommendation is given in the form of phosphorous p p2o5 x 044 kg p kg p2o5 x 044 kg p 16 x 044 kg p 704 so super phosphate contains 704 p and the recommendation is given as 60 kg p to supply 60 kg p1007046085227 or 852 kg single super phosphate is required similarly we have to calculate the dose of potash through muriate of potash mop as mop contains 60 k2o so mop contains 498 k and the recommendation given is 40 kg kha to supply 40 kg k10049840803 kg or 80 kg mop is required so based on fertilizer analysis and soil test information the fertilizer application rates are calculated as above ring

every 100 kg urea therefore unit value of n in urea 562246 rs1222 per kg n ammonium sulphate has 206 n ie 20 kg n in every 100 kg fertilizer and 24 sulphur therefore unit value of n in ammonium sulphate 1029206 rs4995 per kg n thus the nitrogen is cheaper in urea y et ammonium sulphate also has 24 sulphur in ittherefore for soils with sulphur deficiency ammonium sulphate is a better choice and for soils with normal sulphur levels urea presents a better n source example 2 1 single super phosphate ssp with 7 p costs rs480 per 100 kg 2 di ammonium phosphate dap 20 p and 18 n costs rs1596 per 100 kg ssp has 7 p ie 7 kg p in every 100 kg ssp therefore unit value of p in ssp 4807 rs6857 per kg p whereas dap has 20 p and 18 n ie 20 kg p and 18 kg of n in every 100 kg of dap cost of nitrogen in 100 kg of dap 18 x 1222 rs21996 therefore unit value of p in dap 1596 21996 137600 ie 137620 rs6880 per kg p thus the unit cost of p is the same in both the ferti lisers y et dap also has

nutrients to crops examples of organic manure are cow dung farmyard manure green ma nure compost from crop residues vermicompost and other biological waste organic manures increase the organic matter in the soil organic matter in turn releases the plant food in available form for the use of crops however or ganic manures should not be seen only as carriers of plant food these manures also enable a soil to hold more water and also help to improve the drainage in clay soils they provide organic acids that help to dissolve soil nutrients and make them available for the plants additionally organic manures have low nutrient content and therefore need to be applied in large quantities for example to get a standard mixture of 25 kg npk almost 10002000 kg organic manure is required whereas the same amount of npk can be easily obtained with a 50 kg ba g of npk fertilizer compost compost is well decomposed organic wastes like plant residues animal dung and urine earth from cattle sheds waste fodder etc tips for fym preparation provide s hade to compost site make compost pit in a well drained elevated place smaller heaps of manageable shape are better keep the pit free from weeds pit should be near to cattle shed and water source allowing for full maturity also use urine if ash is added do not heap in the pit but spread uniformly how to use manure shou ld not be kept exposed in the field before application preferably apply in bands into the soil instead of broadcast in case broadcast work it into the soil immedia tely advantage complete plant nutrient improved soil structure increases soil aeration and drainability organic matter acts as biological clay and increase nutrient and water holding capacity of soil it reduces the bulk density to desirable level 13gcc it provides enough food for micro organisms in the soil and helps to build up microorganisms in the soil nutrients slow release nature is very useful for long duration and plantation crops disadvantage it is bulky cost of handling transportation and storage are high high labour input high cost per kg of nutrients vermicompost vermicomposting is a process by which earthworms convert organic waste into fertile manure important spp of earthworm used for vermicomposting in indian conditions are epigeic eugeniae eisenia foetida and perionyx excavatus earthworms feed on soil and soil organic matter and con vert it into compost encourage growth of useful micro organisms aerate and pulverize the soil make soil porous and improving drainage increasing water holding capacity of soil give strength to plant immunity system advantages of vermicompost easy to use low cost to produce convert organic matter in to good manure in short time how to make it enrich vermicompost with bioagents earthworms are our friends protect them and nurture in the field green manures select important species find a season to fit the green manuring crop in to cropping system incorporate when 45 days old allow 1520 days before next planting for decomposition example sunhemp and daincha green leaf manure grow leguminous trees on road side on bunds and waste landsoil and plant nutrition farmers handbook on basic agriculture 51 loppings of trees can be incorporated 15 days before planting provide approximately 5 to 10 tons example pongamia and neem oilcakes concentrated organic matter mix with chemical fertilizer is useful as they make fertilizer slow release use to enrich compostorganics use preferably non edible oil cakes liquid fertilisers liquid form of fertilizers are applied with irrigation water or for direct application through foliar spray to augment yield and improve quality of a variety of crops like fruits vegetables oil seeds pulses cereals cotton tobacco sugarcane tea etc it will ease handling less labour requirement as well as the possibility of mixing with herbicides have made the liquid fertilisers more acceptable to farmers fertigation fertigation is the judicious application of fertilizers by combining it with irrigation water fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer tank venturi system injector pump nonelectric proportional liquid dispenser nepld and automated system advantages of fertigation ensures a regular flow of water as well as resulting in increased growth rates for higher yields offers greater versatility in the timing of the nutrient application to meet specific crop demands improves availability of nutrients and their uptake by the roots safer application method which eliminates the danger of burning the plant root system offers simpler and more convenient application than soil application of fertilizer thus saving time labour equipment and energy improves fertilizer use efficiency reduction of soil compaction and mechanical

carrier material like finely powdered coal lignite or humus and supplied in a solid form basically two types of bio fertilizer distinguished based on their capacity to supply nitrogen or phosphorus some biofertilizers have the capacity to supply nitrogen because they have the capacity to absorb nitrogen gas from the atmosphere in association with plants and use the nutrient for their cell synthesis the nitrogen fixed becomes available to crop plants after the plant material is incorporated in to soil this process is known as symbiotic nitrogen fixation other nitrogen fixing organisms can live freely in soil and fix nitrogen there is one more type where the organism establishes a weak or associative symbiosis and fixes nitrogen in addition to nitrogen fixers there are some bacte ria and fungi which are used as biofertilizers to enhance phosphorus supply to crops they solubilize insoluble or difficulty soluble phosphorus through their capacity to produce organic acids52 soil

nature which occurs at least twice ie the first time when the fruits are little more than the marble size and the second time when the fruits are fully developed or at the time of colour break this drop is very serious in the ambia bahar crop preharvest fruit drop in nagpur mandarin66 soil and plant nutrition farmers handbook on basic agriculture nagpur mandarin which is called as preharvest fruit drop and is important from economic point of view to the orchardists to control the fruit drop that occurs after fruit set two foliar sprays of either 24d or ga3 at 15 ppm urea 1 and copper oxychloride 2 03 at monthly intervals in april may are recommended same spray concentration is recommended for controlling preharvest drop in the months of september and october 24d and ga3 may be dissolved earlier in little quantity 30 40 ml for 1g of some organic solvent such as alcohol or acetone before making the spray solution control of insect pests blackfly kolshi nymphs of citrus blackfly attack the young flush suck the sap and excrete sweet and sticky liquid which favours rapid development of black sooty mould that covers entire plant surface the process of photosynthesis is hampered greatly resulting in stunted growth of plants low intensity of flowering scarce fruiting which are insipid in taste and decline of citrus orchard sets for control of blackfly two sprays of insecticides viz acetamiprid 02 glitre water should be given at 50 egg hatching stage that normally occurs in the ii weed of july and the i week of december and april one additional spray which targets the adult blackfly population when it is as its peak helps tremendously in controlling the pest method of spraying spraying should be directed at the underside of the leaf ensuring the complete drenching of the tree for proper coverage and penetration of canopy use of power sprayers for spraying operation should be envisaged insecticides should be used alternatively for better results citrus psylla numerous young brownish nymphs of psylla are seen crawling on the young flush several dirty gray colour adults can be seen sitting in line with tails upwards voluminous desapping by the nymphs results into the drop of flush flowers and berries affected branches dry and dieback sets in the nymphs also excrete white crystalline powder which invites fungal infestation psylla can be controlled by spraying acetamiprid 02 glitre water twice with 10 days interval during the initial days of flushing bark eating caterpillar larva are incidence of mites on fruits lalya leaf miner serpentine mines are seen on the new leaves and also young stems are mined when the incidence is severe at times death of young shoots may occur the problem is quite serious in nursery and in young orchard to control citrus leaf miners spray either imidacloprid 5 ml to be used in proper doses under guidance of an agriculture expert and thiamethoxam 02glitre water bark eating caterpillar the pest is noticed predominantly in the older and ignored orchards the hanging wooden frass and tunnel at the joint of two branches during october april indicates the presence of the pest larva remains hidden inside the tunnel during daytime and becomes active in the night and feeds on the bark nearby the tunnel this results into snapping of food supply ultimately yellowing of leaves on the branch and its slow decline for control of the pest the wooden frass should be cleaned and each tunnel should be administered with emamectin benzoatespinosad 04 mllitre water fruit sucking moth the moth attacks the ripening fruits during late hours in the evening the moth punctures it making a hole in the ripening fruit to suck the juice through which an infection may take place soon rottening starts leading to fruit drop collection of dropped fruits and their nagpur mandarinsoil and plant nutrition farmers handbook on basic agriculture 67destruction followed by smoking of orchard late evening hours is suggested for fruit fly control hanging of methl eugenol feromone traps is an effective method to check the pest mites citrus rust mites attack in mrig bahar fruits especially during september november the fruit surface particularly the side exposed to sun is brushed and develops a big patch of dark brown colour called lalya only after 1 to 112 months to check this two alternating prophylactic sprays at 1520 days interval with fenazaquin 10 ec 4mllitre and wettable sulphur 3 gl water are recommended in september october similarly a phytophthora caused gummosis spray of acetamipridthiamethoxam 02glitre water at the berry stage of the ambai fruits is required to protect the fruits from unpleasant scars precautionary measures avoid water stagnation in orchard by providing channels along the slope for proper drainage moreover pruning of intermingling branches to allow aeration and sunlight to prevent dampness in orchard are suggested presence of guava pomegranate chiku mango trees etc near the orchard act as the alternate hosts for blackfly therefore such trees should also be covered with insecticidal sprays control of diseases twig blight drying of fruit bearing branches after harvest is a common phenomenon removal of such dried shoots along with the 2 cm lower live part followed by a fungicidal spray ie copper oxychloride or bordeaux paste

rejuvenation of declining citrus orchards declining citrus orchards can be rejuvenated with the use of developed technologies and brought into productive stage harvesting traditionally fruits are harvested by twisting and pulling forcefully which may lead to a hole in the neck of the fruit or injury to the stem end the fruits should be selectively harvested when th of the skin turns yellow tss acidity ratio should not be less than 14 in both ambia and mrig bahar fruits tss should be at least 10 once this stage is reached harvesting should not be delayed for colour development since other fruits may turn loose fruit should not be allowed to come in contact with soil and straw and also should not be exposed to hot sun packing should be done immediately after harvesting for waxing on a large scale packing line can be used washing and waxing stay fresh high shine was 25 g tebuconazole and grading of fruits is also done automatically at the end graded fruits are packed in corrugated fibre board boxes 50 x 30 x 30 cm which are telescopic with holes on both the sides covering 5 of total side portion to keep the fruits safe from moisture in the store house boxes should be externally laminated with plastic for small scale 1 15 tonne and short duration 20 25 days storage an evaporative cool chamber is recommended costing rs10000 to 12000 for delaying or postponing the harvest of the fruits two sprays of ga3 100 mg 10 litre of water in 15 day intervals at the point of the colour break are recommended for long duration cold storage a temperature of 67 0 c and humidity 9095 is

cycles methods of insect control including integrated pest management ipm plant protection equipments symptoms of major diseases integrated disease management major weeds methods of controlling weeds safe handling of chemicals3 plant protection 33 crop pest and their importance pest is any organism which is detrimental to crop production pest cause damage to the plant to the extent of 30 90 per cent sometimes it even causes total loss pest includes insects diseases and weeds non insect pest includes nematodes snails and rodents insect is any of many small invertebrate animals having a segmented body and three pairs of legs and usually two pairs of wings some insects are beneficial and some are harmful to agriculture what is the difference between complete and incomplete metamor phosis in insects incomplete and complete metamorphosis differs in the number of life cycle stages that insects go through during their transformation from egg to adult the complete metamorphosis has 4 life cycle stages and an incomplete metamorphosis has 3 life cycle stagescomplete metamorphosis complete metamorphosis has four distinct life cycle stages egg larva pupa and adult examples of insects that go through complete metamorphosis are butterflies silkworms mealworms and ladybugs the larva can be wormlike even though the six legs are still visible the larva form moths and butterflies are called caterpillars maggots are the larval stage of flies the larvae eat constantly and grow rapidly a hard protective case forms around the larva at pupa stage the pupa stage for a butterfly is called a chrysalis the pupa stage for moth is called cocoon incomplete metamorphosis incomplete metamorphosis has three life cycle stages egg nymph and adult the nymph looks similar too but is a smaller version of the adult the nymph is also wingless examples are grasshoppers cockroaches ants and praying mantids 34 life stages of insects egg is the initial stages of the insect normally an insect lays at least 30 to 300 egg hatch into l a rva or worms larva is the i pest management72 plant protection farmers handbook on basic agriculture damaging stage of insect to any crop this stage is normally seen in the field pupa is an inactive stage preparing itself to develop to an adult mostly adults insects are harmless but many bugs and beetles are harmful to plantshow the damage is visible the larva eats the leaf fruits or the whole plant parts hence the damage is visible some insects scrape the plant tissues they also cut the growing parts beetles bugs thrips and hoppers usually suck the sap from the plants and growing parts affecting the healthy plant not at all honey bees are also insects which help in pollination brings pollen from one plant to another

that are beneficial to man since they feed from the egg or larvae and pupae of crop pest they are called biological control agents examples are the trichogramma parasite for sugarcane borers crub of green lacewing and ladybird beetle 35 insect classification insects can be classified into 3 groups depending on their behaviour in the farm such as pests beneficial insects neutral insects pest whether an insect species is a pest or not depends on the situation this means that a cer tain insect could be a pest in one situation but not in another situation for example the caterpillars of diamondback moth feed on cabbage and other plants of the cruciferae family a farmer who grows cauliflower will therefore consider it a pest y et for a farmer who grows potatoes or bananas the diamondback moth is a neutral insect when there is nothing to feed it will not even occur in a paddy crop black gram is a weedpest since it is growing unnecessarily in a black gram field cow pea is a weed since it can grow pest will occur only if there is a host beneficial insects some insects are beneficial to the farmer because they are the natural enemies of harmful insects predators feed on other insects and hence control the pest for example the assassin bug kills caterpillars and ladybird beetles feed on aphids some other insects are beneficial as they help in pollination of plants eg honey bees there are commercially beneficial insects such as silkworm which produces silk neutral insects a neutral insect is neither a pest nor beneficial y et again it really depends on the context a mosquito in the rice field can be considered as neutral insect 36 how to control pest natural control understanding insect life cycle insects mul tiply in large numbers however the survival rate is very less as the nature maintains insect population factors like extreme temperature heavy rains heavy wind water stagnation birds lizards spiders animals other insects and diseases control the pest natural barriers like sea river lake mountains etc prevent movement and spread of pest mechanical control some of the recommended practices are removal of affected parts collection and destruction of insects drying of seeds tar coating of trees to protect from termites provision of barriers to prevent the entry of pests like green house screen house covering of pomegranate fruits with butter paper etc clipping off the withered shoots agronomical methods recommended culti vation practices are as follows summer ploughing opens up the soil and exposes pest to hot sun and predators trap crop is growing the most favoured crop of the insect along with the main crop the insect feeds from the trap crop and the main crop remains not unaffected growing of resistant varieties also prevents the pest attack main crop trap crop tomato marigold cotton okra castor onion garlic maize sorghum mixed cropping is growing more than one crop inter cropping growing another crop along with main crop which increases the population of natural enemy main crop intercrop cabbage tomato mustard cotton black gram green gram maize sorghum crop rotation is growing of different crops in 74 plant protection farmers handbook on basic agriculture sequence instead of one single crop keeping the fields clean managing the weeds which provides home for pests treating the seeds with pesticides growing the crops in seasons where pest incidence is less application of correct dose of fertilizer at correct time optimum use of water are some of the agronomical methods to control pests pest load and monitoring pest monitoring is the practice of examining the crop to know whether the pest has affected the crop and the extent of damage to decide whether to spray the pesticide or not economic threshold level etl etl is the pest population density at which the control measure has to be taken up to prevent the pest from reaching economic injury level etl for some of the crops are as follows brown plant hopper in paddy nymph or adult hopper 510 hill leaf miner in groundnut 2 larvae 10 plant or 2030 plant infestation whitefly in cotton 510 adults leaf or 20 nymphs leaf biological control methods there are several biological agents that controls pest such as the insect that kills another insect by living inside its body is called parasite there is egg larval and pupal parasites trichogramma is an egg parasite used commercially on sugarcane borers predators are insects that eat other insects for example the ladybird beetle dragonfly damselfly etc insects are also affected by many diseases some are fungal bacterial and viral verticillium a fungal agent bacillus a bacterial agent and npv virus are commercially usedphysical control an age old practice is to mix pulses with red earth to protect pulses from pulse beetle drying of seeds in hot sun and using radiation are some of the physical control methods traps light trap most of the insects are attracted towards light this principle is used to monitor and control pests pheromone trap insects are trapped using the scent of one sex this is commonly used for the control of cotton bollworms y ellow sticky traps some of the small sucking insects are attracted by yellow colour hence yellow coloured containers smeared with sticky materials are kept inside the field to attract sucking insect chemical control manual pesticide spraying pesticide application is the last resort to control pests pesticides to be selected carefully to control the pests dose and spraying equipments should be selected carefully get the correct recommendation from the extension worker understand the difference between chemical name and trade name trade name is the trader given name but the chemical name is originated based on the chemical ingredient botanicals are plant origin pesticides like neem based formulations we can also use neem seed kernal extract or neem oil along with soap as pesticides commercial botanicals are available in the market and botanicals can be prepared which cost less and are eco friendly ladybird beetle trapplant protection farmers handbook on basic agriculture 75for example neem seed kernal extract nske 5 gronim achook and neemazal 37 pesticides pesticides are the chemicals used to control pests the pesticides can be broadly classified into three groups based on how they act on insects contact and stomach poison when insect comes into contact or when the insect eats the pesticide sprayed parts it gets killed contact and stomach poison is used for controlling larvae that feed on leaves examples include flubendamide some of the pesticides derived from plants also have contact action for example pyrethrum sabadilla etc systemic poison when the chemical is sprayed on the plant it is absorbed by the plant and transferred to the entire plant system sucking type of pest like aphids leafhoppers thrips suck the sap from plants this kind of sucking pests can be controlled by systemic poison like imidacloprid to be used with caution flubendamide acetamiprid thiamethoxam etc 1 fumigant forms vapour and acts on breath ing system of the insects when insects breathe it they get killed examples include hydrogen cyanamide sulfuryl fluoride etc insecticides are poisons which cannot be used directly they need to be used as per directions given on the container or as per the recommendation of extension workers insecticides are available in different forms of which some arei dust d poisons are mixed with gypsum talc or clay so that it can be used in powder form there is no need to mix with water ii wettable powders wpwdpmixed with dry fillers with sticking agents but these dry powders can be mixed with water iii granules g dry formulations in which poisons are mixed with calcium or gypsum in granulated form main merit of this formulation is handling will be easy it is not carried away by the wind and it is less toxic to plants iv liquid forms soluble liquids sl emulsifi able concentrates ec and soluble concentrates sc liquid forms of pesticides since the pesti cides are directly soluble in water they are mixed with organic solvents ec formulations disperse in water easily as they are mixed with emulsifiers v fumigants are the poisons in gas form normally it is used to fumigate godowns grains storage rooms and ships even for rat control vi poison baits poisons mixed with food mate rial the latter acts as attractants baits are exclu sively used to control rats as the rats are more sensitive pre baiting is necessary 38 types of chemicals organochlorines

protection farmers handbook on basic agriculture 312 disease disease is an impairment of the normal state of a plant that interrupts or modifies its vital functions all species of plants wild and cultivated alike are subject to disease although each species is susceptible to characteristic diseases these are in each case relatively few in number the occurrence and prevalence of plant diseases vary from season to season depending on the presence of the pathogen environmental conditions and the crops and varieties grown some plant varieties are particularly subject to outbreaks of diseases disease of crops and their importance plant become diseased when it is continuously disturbed by some causal agent including an abnormal process that disrupts the plants there are more than 80000 plant diseases diseases reduce the yield of the crops and sometimes lead to disaster eg late blight of potato panama of banana etc managing outbreak of diseases is challenge to the farmer causes of plant disease infectious diseases caused due to fungi bacte ria viruses nematodes etc noninfectious diseases caused due to unfa vourable extraneous condition such as scorching sunlight high temperature moisture stress or deficiency of micronutrients ph heavy metal toxicity atmospheric pollution etc 313 the disease cycle the main events of stages comprising the disease cycle include the following production and dissemination of the primary inoculum primary infection growth and development of the pathogen secondary infection and over wintering the primary inoculum is the part of the pathogen that is bacterial or fungal spores or fungal mycelium that over winters overseasons and causes the first infection of the season known as primary infection in general the greater the amount of inoculum and the nearer it is to its host the greater the potential for a disease epidemic dissemination refers to the spread or dispersal of the pathogen from an inoculum source to a host dissemination can occur by wind splashing rain insects infested pruning tools infected or infested transplants and other means spread can occur over short distances within the tree canopy or from distant sources primary infection occurs when the pathogen comes into contact with a susceptible host under favour able environmental conditions pathogens penetrate the surface of a plant directly or enter through wounds or natural openings growth and development of a pathogen usually oc curs on or within infected plant tissue secondary infection results from spores or cells produced following primary infection or from other secondary infections the secondary infection cycle can be repeated many times during the growing season the number of cycles is dependent on the biology of the pathogen and its host and the duration of environmental conditions needed for infection over wintering or over seasoning is the ability of a pathogen to survive from one growing season to the next pathogens of apple survive the winter in a number of different ways for a plant disease to occur a susceptible host a pathogen casual agent and favourable environmental conditions must be present and interact with one another if any one of these requirements is not met a plant disease will not occur at present our ability to manipulate the environment is limited to only a few practices such as pruning to promote drying bedding to improve soil drainage and scheduling of irrigation severe disease outbreaks can be prevented by manipulating the host through the use of resistant cultivars and the pathogen

agents that control or contain primary soil and seed borne infestation of insects and diseases which pose devastating consequences to crop production and improving crop safety leading to good establishment of healthy and vigorous plants resulting better yields the benefits of seed treatment are as follows increased germination ensures uniform seedling emergence protect seeds or seedlings from early season diseases and insect pests improving crop emer gence and its growth use of plant growth hormones may enhance crop performance during the growing season rhizobium inoculation enhances

parasitic on plants attack roots and other plant parts causing stunting and yield reduction nematodeinfected plants are not only weakened but their root systems are more susceptible to secondary infections by fungi or bacteria correct identification is the first step when a nem atode problem is suspected the second step is to determine whether populations are high enough to threaten the crop root knot nematodes the most common pathogenic nematodes in vegetables cannot penetrate roots when soil temperatures are below 50 degrees f and will not reproduce when soil temperatures are below 58 degrees f their reproductive rate is slower at cooler temperatures so populations build up more slowly thus cool season crops are less likely to be damaged eg early spring potatoes are rarely damaged by nematodes nematode management practices isolation once a nematode problem is confirmed affected areas and plants should be isolated because transplants machinery and irrigation water can all spread nematode infections from initially smallinfested areas nematodes can spread across a field at a rate of 3 feet per year crop rotation and cover crops crops suscep tible to root knot nematodes include all cole crop species beans cucumber muskmelon watermelon bendi potato sweet potato and tomato all potatoes are susceptible to nematodes except for a few cultivars resistant to the golden nematode 86 plant protection farmers handbook on basic agriculture rotation to nonhost crops such as corn cucurbits potatoes and tomatoes is an effective control for the cyst nematode but is less likely to control the root knot nematode because of its wider host range all species of meloidogyne are called root knot nematode but each species has a different host range causing confusion over which crops or cultivars are resistant or tolerant to which species of root knot nematode rotations to nonhost crops for more than a year reduce populations below damaging levels but will not eliminate them cover crops significantly reduce subsequent damage to crop increasing soil organic matter higher soil organic matter content protects plants against nematodes by increasing soil waterholding capacity and enhancing the activity of naturallyoccurring biological organisms that compete with nematodes in the soil fallow period a fallow period of two years with no susceptible plants in the field decreases nematode populations marigold as a rotation crop suppress nematodes plant resistance nematode resistant cultivars may be used to reduce the incidence of nematodes symptoms understanding symptom and

farmers correct identification of disease in your farm is essential for effective control of disease with little experience you can identify the disease however you can contact agricultural officers of your area along with disease specimen and seek their help in identifying the disease y ou can also give diseaseaffected plant parts to the agri clinics for clinical test before under taking control measures follow integrated diseases management such as host plant resistance agronomic practices judicious use of fungicides pesticides for vector control biopesticides for pathogen control etc as indicated below 318 integrated disease management practices in the field select varieties and hybrids resistant to the most common or economically important diseases in consultation with agricultural officers of your area for example plant only good quality diseasefree seed having good germination eg cotton seed having above 80 germination will have vigorous growth and will not suffer from infection of soil borne diseases use seedtreatment with fungicides to control diseases plant when soil temperature and moisture are most favourable for specific crop eg if the farmers take up sowing of cotton during the warmer temperature 65 f there will be better germination and growth avoid planting the same crop in a field year after year eg i growing paddy in the veriticillium wilt infested field will reduce the incidence of micro bial population in the soil ii growing chrysanthemum will inhibit the growth of the veriticillium in the soil incorporate the crop residues of the previous crop by tilling well before planting season eg disease affected plants should be burnt immediately choose right sowing time and maintain appropriate plant population by adopting recommended spacing apply a balanced fertilizers based on a soil test eg potassium deficiency leads to susceptibility of alternaria leaf spot apply recommended amount of farmyard manurescompost at regular intervals and maintain soilorganic matter content eg over dose of chemical fertilisers lead to more vegetative growth and more disease enrich soil with beneficial microorganisms like trichoderma keep the land weed free weeds can serve as alternate hosts for pathogens and helps disease development timing and duration of irrigation should match the crop and water requirement without allowing for excess water eg excessive irrigation favour soil borne pathogen maintain insect population below etl to reduce the incident of disease transfer by insects regular crop monitoring is essential for effective disease

wanted weeds compete with crops for water soil nutrients light and space weeds reduce crop yields to the extent of up to 50 percent critical period of weed competition is approximately 13rd of the duration of the crop characteristics of weeds one year seeding seven years weeding produces larger number of seeds compared to crops eg amaranthus retroflexus produces 196405 seedsplant whereas wheat rice produces only 90 to 100 seedsplant most of the weed seeds are small in size easy and diverse means of seed dispersion seeds germinate earlier and grow faster flower earlier and mature ahead of the crop germinate under tough conditions season bound seeds are dormant for long period and germinate during suitable season good viability for years tolerate moisture stress possess stronger and deeper root system effect of weed competition on crop growth and yield crop suffers from nutritional deficiency growth is reduced water requirement will be more lowers the input response pest and disease incidence will be more yield is affected cost of production will increase320 critical period of weed competition for important crops crops days from sowing rice lowland 35 rice upland 60

handbook on basic agriculture 322 control measures of weeds principles of weed control prevention eradication control management a preventive weed control avoid using crop that are infested with weed seeds for sowing avoid adding weeds to the manure pits nursery or planting material should be free from weeds keep irrigation channels fencelines and uncropped areas clean constantly look for weed destroy the weeds then and there use good quality certified seeds which are free from weed seeds use preemergence herbicides to prevent ger mination of weeds b eradication complete removal weeds are killed or completely removed from a given area will not reappear unless it is introduced again however it is very difficult involves high cost can be used in green houses and nurseries c control weeds growth is restricted and killed when necessary so that it does not affect crop growth d weed management managing the population of weeds using all possible methods i mechanical method tillage using plough or disc weeds are removed from soil and exposed to sunlight hoeing using hand hoe annual and bienni als are completely removed hand weeding either by physical removal or pulling out of weeds by hand or using some implements digging advisable in the case of perennial weeds using sickle top portion of weeds are removed using sickle thereby weeds seed production is controlled burning burning is often an economical and practical means of controlling weeds but not always possible in crop production field flooding kills weeds by reducing oxygen to plant growth this is possible only under gar den land or wetland condition merits of mechanical method oldest and effective method safe method for environment high skill is not necessary weeding is possible in between plants deep rooted weeds can be controlled effectively demerits of mechanical method labour and time consuming possibility of crop damage requires ideal moisture costly ii cultural weed control summer ploughing is done immediately after summer showers this exposes weeds to hot sun field preparation makes the field weed free by constant removal select crop that can compete better with weeds like cowpea sudan gross sorghum are good competitors fast growing crops suppresses the weed effectively maintenance of optimum plant population adequate plant population covers the land and hence growth of the weed will be difficult close row crops are better than wide row crop rotation minimize the dominance of particular weed in the cropping system growing of intercrops inter cropping cov ers the land quickly and reduce growth of the weeds eg growing crop such as cowpea soybean etc in wide spaced crops like maizepigeon peasugar cane etc mulching mulch is a protective covering of material maintained on soil surface it has smothering effect and reduces the weed growth mulching can be done through degradable farm waste or through plastic sheets in case of plastic black is the most popular colour used in commercial horticulture crop production especially for weed control solarisation done by covering the pre soaked field with transparent polythene cover which increases the temperature by 5 10 cplant protection farmers handbook on basic agriculture 93 stale seedbed weeds are allowed to germi nate and nonresidual herbicide is sprayed to kill the young weed seedlings blind tillage ploughing after sowing of the crop and before plants emerge normally seed drills are used under rainfed condition for this purpose crop management practices vigorous and fast growing crop varieties for better competition with weeds merits of cultural method low cost easy to adopt less technical skill is sufficient no damage to crops effective weed control demerits of cultural method time taking and difficult perennial and problematic weeds can not be controlled iii biological weed control natural enemy of a weed plant is used to control the weed examples zygogramma biolorata for control of par thenium hirsch manniella spinicaudata is a rice root nematode to control most upland rice weeds azolla in rice advantages eco friendly easy low cost disadvantages they may have alternate host or switching over to alternate host multiplication of bio agent in many cases is difficult iv chemical weed control herbicides are chemicals used to control weeds merits recommended for adverse soil and climatic conditions applied even before weeds emerge and make the environment weed free suitable for all types of crops controls the targeted weeds only controls many perennial weed species cost

professional negotiations with buyers input dealers and credit institutions to educate the farmer to make profitable decisions considering available resources and anticipate risks including market fluctuations 42 what we know at the end of the session importance of farm management basic information which support better farm management decision market driven enterprises matching resources with calendar of activities selection of cropping pattern understanding of cost benefit analysis risk analysis in agriculture4 farm management what is a farm farm is a socio economic unit it is composed of farm family farm enterprises and structures farmer is a grower cum manager the farmer has to decide how much land labour capital and type of technology to use to produce in a given season ultimately the farmer has to earn a profit to support his livelihood what will the farmer do in farm man agement the farmer would efficiently use the available re sources to increase profits through deciding among the best alternatives available some basic functions of farm manage ment the farmer performs following basic functions to effectively manage the farm diagnosis analysis of past performance of farm its weaknessstrengths planning planning for the future cropsanimals considering the opportunities and threatsimplementation efficient implementation with least cost monitoring reduce the losses and increase the profits by reducing the costs and choosing better technologies based on the observed opportunities evaluation evaluating the actions for repeating the succeses in future what will happen if the farmer does not do farm management in the absence of good farm management the farmer may experience losses in farming for the following the reasons there is continuous changes in supply and price of agri inputs like seeds fertilizers irrigation power etc there is continuous change in prices of the produce outputs in the market due to demand and supply changes there is continuous change in the farm technologiesmodule 1 is farming a business100 farm management farmers handbook on basic agriculture therefore the objectives of farming as a business are how to choose best varietycropcropping pat tern how to minimise input cost by judicious use how to increase the production and productivity how to enhance the quality how to plan market driven production choosing the better source of finance and better avenues for investment efficient risk management for better farm management the farm er should have thorough knowledge of the following aspects farm map soil slope and topography soil type physical and chemical properties soil colour such as red soil or black soil weather parameter such as rainfall tempera ture relative humidity etc vegetative cover such as trees weeds etc irrigation potential from borewelltubewellnalachannels drainage facilities whether water gets logged or not technology available and whether the farmer can access them easily risk factors like hand loans and high rate of interest market facilities whether they are near to his farm or far off communication facilities like cell phone and internet connectivity physical and infrastructure facilities such as godowns roads for transport vehicles custom hiring centers etc whether a farmer can afford the cropanimal heshe wishes to grow or rear considering the above conditions supporting programmes and schemessubsidies farmers should maintain farm records to have a holistic knowledge of their production system for example if a farmer maintains a record for all the cost of production such as inputs labour etc for the entire crop cycle along with yield and income obtained from selling the produce heshe can compare with the next crop cycle to understand whether hisher profit increased or decreased the records also provides information on activities which contributed for hisher profit or loss so that the farmer can take alternative decisions to enhance hisher net income farm resources to make good farm manage ment decisions farmers need some basic knowledge on farm resources such as the extent of land available for cultivation source of irrigation family labour availability of labour skill level of labours livestock availability of fodder availability of farm machinery availability of inputs such as seeds and fertilizers credit requirement and availability source of credit market demand for produce in frastructure such as cold storage and godowns etc for example regarding manpower and livestock the farmers have to understand

the market the locations of sale who is the buyer who sells the inputs and equipments the quality of product that is demanded by the marketthe quality of inputs and equipment the price of the product compared to other mar ketsthe price of sale of the inputs and equipments when to sell when to buy how does the price of agricultural products change the price of agriculture products change according to the season of the yearthe price of agriculture products change between years at times of abundance the prices are lowest the price of a product that is needed by more and more people will rise from one year to the next at times of scarcity the prices are highest the price a product that is produced in greater abundance will fall from one year to the next the quality of inputs and equipment the price of sale of the inputs and equipments when to buy important lesson to do successful farm business the farmer must be well aware of prices of inputs and produce at dif ferent markets this allows the farmer to plan production as well as make decisions on the purchase of inputs and the sale of producemodule 2 know your farm resources farm planning farm planning is to help the farmers to move to a higher level of production and income starting from where heshe is now with the resource available to himher in this process the farmer has to consider different types of enter prises like land

the highest profit throughout the year farmer should avoid continuous monocropping to ensure soil fertility through crop diversification and rotation to realize sustained profitability of their farm main lessons to know if you are doing successful business with a crop you need to know the income and expenditure accurately the farmer records the inputs labour used in a field and calculates the income and expenditure from the income the farmer subtracts the expenditure the result indicates whether farm is making profit or loss the farmer makes a profit or good business if the income is greater than the ex penditure it is a loss if the expenditure is greater than the income in that case it is bad business a loss is illustrated by the the minus dash and a profit by the plus in front of the number a good farmer will abandon loss making crop or use a better technique to make a profit to ensure a profit the farmer needs to visualise income and expenditure before production the difference between income and expenditure indicates whether we are making a loss or profit from the use of the land the unit cost of a crop indicates if it can compete with the same crop produced elsewhere in the case of food crops the unit cost indicates if it is preferable to buy the produce in the market the good farmer calculates well ahead of the season to decide what to produce and which techniques to use during the production season the good farmer keeps records on money spent for farm operations and inputs after the harvest the good farmer evaluates the profit and identifies what changes are needed to improve the planning and profit for the next production seasonfarm management farmers handbook on basic agriculture 115what are fixed costs certain costs are called fixed costs these are costs for equipment and tools that the farmer owns and are used for various crops over several years such as sprayers irrigation pumps buildings etc the fixed costs do not vary with the size

loanpersonal loan or shall keep the gross income rs 81400 x 2 162800 and spend through out the year based on the need note in this example all produce from the farm is sold as per the prevailing market rates the profit of the farmer depends on the price for the produce ie whether the minimum support price msp or market rates are prevailing which are both fluctuating third step fill the second financial calendar the expenditures for inputs and labour are those from the exercise sheets in module 5 using improved practices fourth step discuss the differences and which situation is preferable what changes are necessary main lessons in the agricultural enterprise expenditure for the farm and the household are incurred every month but the revenue comes only after sale of produce therefore there are months of the year where the expenditures are greater than the revenues these months are called deficit m o n t h s for this reason the good farmer makes a financial calendar the farmer plans expenditures for production and household needs in consultation with his spouse to be able to cover the expenditures in deficit months the good farmer saves money from the sales of produce surplus months improved techniques may contribute to improve the revenues of the farmer the needs for inputs can be identified with calculations of gross margin and the financial calendar this information can be used to make savings in a targeted way or to solicit credit for production the above calculations are done for a farmer with one hectare for paddy paddy combination in kharif and rabi for one year the same exercise should be repeated for taking farm management decisions for the combinations such as cotton maize kharif rabi paddy maize kharif rabi maize maize kharif rabi risk in agriculture the farmer does not like risks because they are difficult to predict however heshe can determine the risk during the planning so that the impact on revenues could be minimised for example module 4 indicates income and expenditure of paddy maize and cotton with available data paddy paddy is the best preferred cropping pattern however the farmer can make a judicious decision taking prevailing and anticipated risks into considerations the anticipated risks and possible decisions are as follows anticipated risks remarks reduction in paddy market price by 10 cotton maize is preferred inadequate water due to drought for paddy paddy cotton maize is preferred followed by maize maize quantity of water available decides the cropping pattern farm management farmers handbook on basic agriculture 119anticipated risks remarks lack of capital for investment for paddy paddy or cotton maizepaddy and maize is preferred followed by maize maize serious pest problems in cotton paddy paddy is preferred main lessons comparing the gross margins of different crops and the production techniques helps to make decisions on using the land to maximise revenue this comparison is important to all agricultural entrepreneurs comparing the labour productivity helps to identify the crops and techniques that make best use of labour family or wage labour it also indicates if it is profitable to work on your own farm comparing the capital productivity indicates which crops or production techniques make best use of money invested production decisions are based on these comparisons the good agricultural entrepreneur knows that a fluctuation in prices constitutes a risk and revenues risks are concern for traditional as well as improved varieties and techniques to evaluate the impact of this market risk the entrepreneur calculates estimated the gross margin with a much lower price pessimistic than the current price or last seasons price if the pessimistic gross margin estimate can still satisfy the revenue objectives then the risk is acceptable to evaluate the impact of production risks the agricultural entrepreneurs calculates a gross margin using a yield lower pessimistic than expected if the pessimistic gross margin estimate can still satisfy the revenue objectives then the risk is acceptableoccupational health and safety farmers handbook on basic agriculture 12151

requiring pesticide use have you observed any predators that check pest attack what is the recommendation for the observed problem which is the least toxic and low persistent chemical among recommendations while buying buy from a reputed and licensed store buy only required quantity and not to go for bulk purchase do not buy leaky containers see the expiry date buy only isi bis marked products dont buy banned and restricted chemicals transportation do not transportcarry pesticides along with food products do not spill or allow leakage while transporting if leakage is observed clean the vehicle storage dont keep chemicals in kitchen or with animal feed keep out of reach of children keep under lock and key keep in well ventilated separate room avoid cross contamination of different chemicals do not keep with human or animal medicine properly reseal before storing again application read the label and follow the instructions dont work alone while handling and applying dont allow children and animals near mixing and application site use long wooden stick for mixing mix only the quantity that you need for the next application avoid excessive spraying and unintended site application read the label and instructions carefully before opening the pack never eat and drink while applying use personal protective equipment ppe particularly long shirt and pants closed shoes as well as protection mask and gloves avoid application during rainy period never blow out clogged nozzles or hoses with your mouth use pin or fine wire for cleaning avoid windy conditions and do not spray against wind direction after application immediately after application take bath and change cloths all clothes must be washed after spraying dusting and wash them separately never leave residues of pesticide in sprayers and dusters while cleaning see that water used for cleaning should not enter the drinking water streamwells do not go into the treated field until the recommended safety period has passed do not harvest produce before safe period safe container disposal burry the containers in the field after use dont use for food and feed storage do not sell empty container do not wash the used containers in community water sources colour coding of pesticides the colour band on the pesticide container indicates the hazard level of pesticides while handling pesticides farmers should take colour band into consideration red very toxic to toxic y ellow harmful blue moderately hazardous green acute hazard unlikely in normal use 57 first aid measures for pesticide poisoning in case of skin contact remove contaminant contacts and wash with clean water in case of inhalation remove from site and provide good clean air site keep the head and shoulder upright in case of unconscious and breathing stops provide artificial respiration if pesticide is swallowed induce vomiting by giving 23 liters salt water give milk after that124 occupational health and safety

snakebite is a routinely occurring life threatening emergency in india the mortality and morbidity associated with the diverse presentation of snake bites can be decreased if a proper history of the patients background and habits combined with a thorough knowledge of the specific features of the regional snakes are kept in mindphysical and mental drudgery to reduce drudgery related to hard work in differ ent agricultural operations several technologies for land preparation weeding pesticide application and various other farm works have been developed including farm machinery which need to be used by the farmers to keep themselves fit and healthy farmers are advised to contact local extension functionaries and scientists to obtain information on such drudgery reducing farm machineries 58 care in use of pesticides by farmers useful tips for safe use of pesticides by farmers are identify the pest and ascertain the damage done use pesticide only if it has exceeded the economical injury level use only the recommended pesticide which is the least toxic read instructions manual of the pesticide and equipment check the spraying equipment and accessories which are to be used ascertain that all components are clean especially filling and suction strainer sprayer tank cut off device and nozzle replace worn out parts such as o ring seal gasket worn out nozzle tip hose clamps and valves test the sprayer and ascertain whether it pumps the required output at rated pressure check the nozzle spray pattern and discharge rate calibrate the sprayer set sprayer speed and nozzle swath by adjusting spray height and nozzle spacingoccupational health and safety farmers handbook on basic agriculture 125 make sure that appropriate protective clothing is available and is used train all concerned with the application and also understand the recom mendations ensure that soap towel and plenty of water is available pesticide should be kept in dry and locked store during spraying take only sufficient pesticide for the days application from the store to the site do not transfer pesticides from original container and packing into the containers recheck the use instructions of pesticide and equipment make sure pesticides are mixed in the correct quantities wear appropriate clothing avoid contamination of the skin especially eyes and mouth liquid formulation should be poured carefully to avoid splashing never eat drink or smoke when mixing or applying pesticides never blow out clogged nozzles or hoses with your mouth follow correct spray technique spray plant crop thoroughly by operating sprayer at correct speed and correct pressure126 occupational health and safety farmers handbook on basic agriculture follow correct spray technique spray plant crop thoroughly by operating sprayer at correct speed and correct pressure never allow children or their unauthorized persons to be nearby during mixing never leave pesticides unattended in the field never spray if the wind is blowing towards grazing livestock or pastures regularly used spraying should be done in the direction of wind after spraying remaining pesticides left in the tank after spraying should be emptied and disposed off in pits dug on wasteland never empty the tank into irrigation canals or ponds never leave unused pesticides in sprayers always clean equipment properly after use oil it and then keep away in storeroom do not use empty pesticide containers for any purpose crush and bury the containers preferably in a land filled dump clean buckets sticks measuring jars etc used in
