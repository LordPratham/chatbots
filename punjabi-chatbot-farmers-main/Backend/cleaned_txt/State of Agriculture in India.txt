manufacturing and services sectors have increasingly contributed to the growth of the economy while the agriculture sectors contribution has decreased from more than 50 of gdp in the 1950s to 154 in 2015 16 at constant prices indias production of food grains has been increasing every year and india is among the top producers of several crops such as wheat rice pulses sugarcane and cotton it is the highest producer of milk and second highest producer of fruits and vegetables in 2013 india contributed 25 to the worlds pulses production the highest for any one country 22 to the rice production and 13 to the wheat production it also accounted for about 25 of the total quantity of cotton produced beside s being the second highest exporter of cotton for the past several years figure 1 yield in different countries tonneha sources food and agriculture organization of the united nations prs however the agricultural yield quantity of a crop produced per unit of land is found to be lower in the case of most crops as compared to other top producing countries such as china brazil and the united states although india ranks third in the production of ric e its yield is lower than brazil china and the united states the same trend is observed for pulses where it is the second highest producer figure 2 agricultural growth in sources agricultural statistics at a glance 2015 prs agricultural growth has been fairly volatile over the past decade ranging from 58 in 2005 06 to 04 in 2009 10 and 02 in 2014 15 such a variance in agricultural growth has an impact on farm incomes as well as farmers ability t o take credit for investing in their land holdings key issues affecting agricultural productivity include the decreasing sizes of agricultural land holdings continued dependence on the monsoon inadequate access to irrigation imbalanced use of soil nutrients resulting in loss of fertility of soil uneven access to modern technology in different parts of the country lack of access to formal agricultural credit limited procurement of food grains by government agencies and failure to provide remunerative prices to farmers some of the recomme ndations made by c ommittees and expert bodies over the years include bringing in agricultural land leasing law s shifting to micro irrigation techniques to i mprove efficiency of water use improving access to quality seeds by

of food grains production in 2015 16 is 252 million this implies that the crop output needs to grow at an annual average of 2 which is close to the current growth trend despite high levels of production agricultural yield in india is lower than other large producing countries agricultural yield is the quantity of a crop produced on one unit of land agricultural yield of food grains has increased by more than four times since 1950 51 and was 2070 kghectare in 2014 157 however as seen in figure 6 indias yield is low when compared to countries such as china brazil and the usa figure 6 yield in different countries in 2014 15 in tonneha sources food and agriculture organization of the united nations prs although india is the second highest producer of paddy rice in the world as of 2013 its yield is lower than china brazil and the usa it is also the leading pr oducer of pulses but its yield is the lowest 89 indias productivity has also grown at a slower rate as compared to others for instance while brazils yield for rice increased from 13 tonneha in 1981 to 4 9 tonneha i n 2011 indias increased from 20 to 36 chinas productivity in rice also grew from 43 to 6 7 in this period food security and nutrition besides providing for the livelihood of farmers and labourers the agricultural sector also addresses food security for the nation the food and agricultural organisa

needs and food preferences for a healthy and active life10 despite high levels of production in the country 15 of the population continues to be under nourished as per 2014 estimates 1112 india enacted the national food security act in 2013 the 2013 act aims to provide food and nutritional security to people by ensuring access to adequate amount of quality fo od at affordable prices13 under the 2013 act persons belonging to certain categories are provided with food grains wheat rice and coarse cereals at subsidised prices as of 2015 68 of the population ie 8 1 crore persons of which 77 are in rural areas and 23 in urban areas are covered under the act14 over the past few decades with increasing per capita income and access to a variety of food groups the consumption pattern of food in the country has been changing dependence on cereals for nutrition has decreased and the consumption of protein has increased15 sources of protein include pulses meat seafood and eggs among others according to a finance ministry report on incentivising the production of pulses in the country poor levels of nutrition suggest that increasing the consumption of proteins should be the policy priority for the government16 the report estimates that the cost of pulses as a source of protein is lower than other sources u nder the current domestic scenario indi a is facing a shortage of pulses

of commerce prs indias trade policy is affected by factors such as domestic availability of commodities cost of production as well as global price levels18 however frequent changes in trade policy such as reducing the import duty on a commodity in response to a sh ortage in supply or decreasing minimum export price of a commodity to facilitat e its exports may have an adverse effect on the development of the agro processing sector 18 factors affecting agricultural productivity increase in small land holdings 140 million hectare of land is used as agricultural area as of 2012 1319 over the years this area has been fragmented into smaller pieces of land as seen in table 3 the number of marginal land holdings less than one hectare increased from 36 million in 1971 to 93 million in 201120 marginal and small land holdings face a number of issues such as problems with using mechanisation and irrigation techniques table 3 agricultural holdings millions holding 1970 71 1980 81 1990

large over 10 hectares sources agriculture census 2011 prs since smaller land holdings are either fragments of larger holdings which have been passed on within the family or have been informally leased by a large holder farmers who cultivate these holdings often do not have a formal lease agreement the absence of such land records does not allow these farmers to access formal credit or be eligible for government benefits such input subsidies or crop insurance schemes land records and informal leasing of the total agricultural area under operation 10 of land has been given out on agricultural leases with the percentage of leased out land varying across states 21 34 of the land in andhra pradesh 25 in punjab 21 in bihar and 18 in sikkim has been leased out in the past states such as 6 karnatak a and west bengal have attempted to provide legal rights to tenant farmers by forming electronic records of land holdings and giving tenant farmers the right to their produce2223 currently laws of tenancy of agricultural land vary across different states21 states such as kerala jammu and kashmir and manipur completely prohibit the leasing of agricultural land others such as bihar karnataka uttar pradesh telangana and odisha allow land leasing only by certain categories of land owners on the other hand states such as gujarat maharashtra and assam do not explicitly prohibit leasing and allow the tenant to purchase the land from the owner after a specified period of tenancy in andhra pradesh tamil nadu and west bengal there is no legal ban on leasing land different states also have differen t ceilings on the area of land which may be leased21 the niti aayog has proposed a model land leasing law to provide for the legalisation of land leasing21 this would ensure that land owners have the security of ownership rights and land tenants are secure in their tenancy legalisation of land tenancy would also ensure that farmers get access to formal credit insurance an d inputs such a s fertilizers table 16 in the annexure provides details regarding land leasing restriction and the extent to which the model land leasing law has been adopted in states24 only madhya pradesh has adopted the model land leasing law so far access to agricultural credit and insurance access to agricultural credit is linked to the holding of land titles as a result small and marginal farmers who account for more than half of the total land holdings and may not h old formal land titles are unable to access institutionalized credit25 farme rs may require credit for short term uses such as purchasing inputs weeding harvesting sorting and transporting or long term uses such as investing in agricultural machinery and equipment or irrigation table 4 shows the

land records and create a transparent system for changing land records and dividing or merging plots of land under the system farmers can collect land record information f or their plot at the tehsil level called pahani these records would contain information such as the survey number of the land land owners details the classification of the soil and details regarding irrigation and crops grown among others the pahani would enable the farmer to i know whether the plot he wants to purchase is genuine ii raise farm credit from banks iii use the land records for official or legal purposes e bhoomi also allows farmers to approach the government to address g rievances bargadar system in west bengal the west bengal land reforms act 1955 provides certain rights to bargadars or land tenants bargadars are persons lawfully cultivating any land belonging to another person who is not a family member under the act produce from the farm is divided bet ween the tenant and owner in a 5050 proportion if the cattle manure and seeds are provided by the landowner and 7525 in all other cases illegal eviction of tenants is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment or fine under the act however it does not provide any ownership rights to the tenant 7 farmers with land holdings of less than a hectare primarily borrow from informal sources of credit such as moneylenders 41 whereas those with land holdings of two or more hectares primarily borrow from banks 50 or more other major sources of agricultural credit include shopkeepers relatives or friends and co operative societies key issues relating to agricultural credit are lack of access to formal credit owin g to unclear land records skewed ratio between short term and long term agricultural credit and inadequate access to crop insuran ce these are summarized below25 short term and long term credit short term credit is generally taken for pre harvest and post harvest activities such as weeding harvesting sorting and transporting long term credit is generally taken in order to invest in agricultur al machinery and equipment irrigation and other developmental activities etc over the past few decades the trend of short term and long term agricultural credit in the country has reversed in 1990 91 a majority of crop loans taken was long term cre dit whereas short term credit accounted for only about a quarter of all agricultural loans26 as of 2011 12 6 1 of crop credit was short term whereas lo ng term credit had a share of 39 27 in addition small and marginal farmers who account for about 86 of total land holdings take more short term loans than farmers with medium or large land holdings this group of farmers also has the highest share of borrowings from informal sources of credit such as moneylenders family and friends inadequate a ccess to crop insurance as of 2011 about 10 of indian farmers were covered under a crop insurance scheme28 some persistent issues with the crop insurance system include i unawareness about insurance schemes ii inadequate coverage of insurance schem es iii assessment of the extent of damages in case of crop losses and iv timely settlement of claims29 the standing committee on finance has recommended that assessment of crop damage should be completed and compensation should be deposited directl y into farmers accounts in a timely manner29 in addition to reduce the seeking of unproductive credit the government should create awareness about what crops should be grown based on the quality of soil and incidence of rainfall etc in different regions29 a committee on financial inclusion under th e reserve bank of india had recommended that credit eligibility certificates which would act as tenancylease certificates should be issued to tenant farmers25 these certificates would enable also landless cultivators to obtain agricultural credit it recommended that the reserve bank of india should issue guidelines to banks to give loans to farmers against these certificates pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana the pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana was launched by the central government in january 201630 the scheme aims to provide insurance coverage to farmers for crop failure stabilise farmers income and encourage farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices among others the scheme has been allocated rs 9000 crore in the union budget 2017 18 compared to rs 5501 crore in 2016 173132 the scheme covers all farmers including tenant farmers and sharecroppers who are growing notified crops in notified areas it covers crops such as cereals pulses oilseeds vegetables and spices as of december 2016 the scheme has covered 367 lakh farmers for a sum of rs 1 41625 crore in the kharif se ason of 2016 as compared to 309 lakh farmers and a sum of rs 69307 crore in the kharif season of 2015333435 8 availability of water currently about 51 of the agricultural area cultivating food grains is covered by irrigation36 the rest of the area is dependent on rainfall rain fed agriculture sources of irrigation include ground water wells tube wells and surface wat er canals tanks table 5 shows the various sources of irrigation used in agriculture table 5

6046 tanks 58 4180 there is a need to improve the efficiency of water use especially in agriculture irrigation currently consumes about 84 of the total available water in the country 37 nearly 65 of the irrigated land holdings use ground water sources such as tube wells and wells for irrigation the past few decades has led to an overuse of ground water sources in states especially those growing water intensive crops such as rice for instance in haryana and rajasthan 40 75 of the ground water units are over exploited and the situation is worse in punjab where 7590 of ground wa ter uni ts have been over exploited38 details of ground water development across states may be found in table 15 in the annexure the commission for agricultural cost s and prices has recommended that quantitative ceilings should be fixed on the per hectare use of water39 in addition farmers using lesser water than the ceiling fixed should receive money equivalent to remaining units of water at the current domestic co sts this would incentivize them to ration their use of water in 2011 and 2013 the government released model bill s for ground water management based on which states could formulate their own laws40 it also launched a policy in 2012 relating to water demand management efficiency of water usage and pricing41 the model bills were based on the doctrine of public trust under which resources meant for public use cannot be converted into private owner ship more r ecently the ministry of water resources circulated a model bill for groundwater 2016 which may be adopted by states 42 the bill provides an institutional framework for the protection and management of groundwater it states that groundwate r is a common resource of all persons and ownership of the land over a groundwater resource should not deprive others from accessing it it also states that industrial or bulk usage of groundwater will be priced micro irrigation techniques the economi c survey 2015 16 observed that india largely uses the technique of flood irrigation where water is allowed flow in the field and seep into the soil43 this results in the wastage of water since excess water seeps into the soil or flows off the surface wit hout being utilised it has been recommended that farmers should move from flood irrigation to the drip or sprinkler irrigation systems micro irrigation44 this would help in co nserving water as well as save on the cost of irrigation using micro irrigation systems such as drip or sprinkler irrigation has also been linked to an increase in the yield of crops note that india uses 2 3 times as much water to produce one tonne of grain as countries such as china brazil and the united states43 if india also increases its efficiency of water use it will be able to cover a wider area for irrigation table 14 in the annexure provides a state wise coverage of micro irrigation in the country soil and fertilizers quality of s oil soil is one of the most important factors in the productivity of agriculture indian soil consists of primary nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorous and potassium secondary nutrients such as sulphur 9 calcium and magnesium and micro nutrients such as zi nc iron and manganese45 while the levels of food production have increased over the past few decades it has also led to issues such as an imbalance of nutrients in the soil decline in the water table as well as the quality of water and overall deplet ion of soil health the ministry of agriculture has noted that the quality of indian soil is deteriorating46 about 53 billion tonnes of soil gets eroded annually at a rate of about 164 tonnehectare imbalance in the use of fertilizers in soil may als o result in a loss of fertility if farmers are unaware about the kind of fertilizer which is required for the soil in which they sow their crops the productivity of the soil will be subsequently affected the soil health card scheme was launched by the central government in 2015 under the scheme all farmers are issued soil health cards once every three years the soil health cards contain information such as the nutrient status of the soil and the recommended dose of nutrients to be provided to th e soil to improve its fertility as of february 2017 29 crore farmers have been covered under this scheme47 25 crore soil samples have been collected and 18 crore samples have been tested48 the ministry had set a target of 253 crore samples to be collected by march 2017 imbalance in use of f ertilizers the manufacture sale and distribution of fertilizers in the country is regulated by the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers under the essential commodities act 1955 there are three major ty pes of nutrients used as fertilizers nitrogen n phosphatic p and potassic k of these the pricing of urea containing n fertilizer is controlled by the government while p and k fertilizers were decontrolled in 1992 on the recommendation of a joint parliamentary committee it has been observed that urea is used more than other fertilizers while the recommended ratio of use of the npk fertilizers is 421 this ratio in india is currently at 672416 overuse of urea is especially observed in the states of punjab haryana and uttar pradesh 6 figure 7 shows the trend in the consumption of fertilizers over the past decade an imbalanced use of urea may lead to a loss of fertility in the soil over a period of time affecting productivity urea n is the most produced 86 consumed 74 and imported 52 fertilizer in the country49 the government determines the quantity of fertilizers to be imported based on their domestic availability however the process of fixing the quantity to be impor ted and actually receiving the imports takes about 60 70 days since only three companies are allowed to import urea into the country thus s hortages are often caused in the urea market since f armers have to ensure that urea is applied to their crops on time it leads to the growth of black markets selling urea often at prices above the maximum retail prices49 the level of fertilizer required for a crop depends upon the soil type level of yield and water availability in addition to the type of crop6 certain crops such as rice wheat maize cotton and sugarcane require larger quantities of nitrogen as compared to pulses fruits and vegetables although the ratio of n p and k fertiliz er usage across crops has increased the quantity of fertilizers used by india is still lower as compared to other countries the average consumption of fertilizers increased from 106 kg per ha in 2005 06 to 128 kg per ha in 2012 13 in comparison pakis tan consumes 205 kg per ha and china consumes 396 kg per ha figure 7 consumption of fertilizers lakh tonnes sources

of 300 million tonnes of food grains by 2025 which was mentioned earlier 45 million tonne of fertilizers would be required of this 6 7 million tonnes may be met from organic fertilizers but the rest would be met by chemic al fertilizers containing n p and k the domestic production of fertilizers would have to be increased to meet this demand6 fertilizer subsidy figure 8 fertilizer subsidy in rs crore to promote the use of fertilizers by farmers the central government provides a fertilizer subsidy to the producers of fertilizers in 2017 18 rs 70000 crore has been allo cated for fertilizer subsidy which is the second biggest expenditure on subsidy after food subsidy32 allocations for fertilizer subsidy have been increasing at an annual rate of 114 between 2000 and 2016 of the subsidy allocated for 2017 18 rs 49768 crore has been alloca ted for subsidy on urea figure 8 shows the trend in the fertilizer subsidy 2000 01 onwards currently the amount of subsidy to be given is determined based on the cost of production of the fertilizer company49 companies with a higher cost of production receive greater subsidies this reduces the companies incentive to reduce their cost of production although the consumpti on of urea has been increasing over the past decade no new domestic production capacity has been added in the past 15 years49 a committee that ex amined the role of food corporation of india recommended that cash transfers should be made to farmers to replace the current fertilizer subsidy regime51 this would allow farmers to choose fertilizers in the combination best suited to their needs and help them to fix the fertilizer imbalance in soil in the union budget 2016 17 it was announced that a direct benefit transfer program for fertilizers wou ld be launched on a pilot basis in a few districts across the country52 in july 2016 the government announced that it would be conducting pilot studies of direct benefit transfers in 16 districts in 2016 1753 use of p esticides the consumption of chemical pesticides in the country has increased over the past few years from 55540 tonne in 2010 11 to 57353 tonne in 2014 1554 over this time period the imports of pesticides a lso increased from 53996 tonne to 77376 tonne issues with regard to the use of pesticides include use of low quality pesticides and a lack of awareness about pesticide use the economic survey 2015 16 noted that the use of pesticides without proper guidelines has led to an increase in pesticide residue being found in food products in india18 nutrient based subsidy policy the central government launched the nutrient based subsidy policy nbs in 2010 for p and k fertilizers the policy was formulated with the objective of promotin g a balanced use of n p and k fertilizers the policy allowed the manufacturers of p and k fertilizers to fix their maximum retail prices mrps at reasonable levels the subsidy provided would be based on per kilogram of the nutrient the policy also provided for an additional subsidy to be paid to indigenous manufacturers of fertilizers the comptrolle r and auditor general of india in its report on the performance of the nbs policy stated that in the five years since its implementation the policy h ad not succeeded in bringing about a balanced use of fertilizers50 the fertilizer usage ratio of urea increased from 43 in 2009 10 to 82 in 2012 13

their usage is administered by the ministry of agriculture there is a need to review the insect icide act 1968 to provide for a regulatory framework for the pesticides sector6 the standing committee on agriculture has also recommended tha t a pesticides development and regulation authority be created to regulate the manufacturing import and sale of pesticides in the country6 other recommendations include developing an integrated pest management system which includes a mix of the mechanical and biological methods of pest control and encourages the use of bio pesticides18 access to quality seeds quality seeds is another input necessary for agricultural productivity and good quality seeds accoun t for 20 25 of increased crop productivity55 seeds are regulated by the seeds act 1966 the act regulates the quality production and sale of seeds the seeds control order 1983 regulates the licenses to sell export and import seeds three varieti es of seeds commonly used are i farm saved seeds which account for 65 70 of the total seeds consumption ii commercially p roduced seeds of the breeder foundation and certified varieties and i ii genetically modified and hybrid seeds agricultur al seeds are produced by various agencies such as indian council of agricultural research and its research institutions s tate agricultural universities and national and state seeds corporations the private sector has also started playing a role in supp lying some seeds such as hybrid maize bajra cotton and sunflower some of the challenges identified in the development and distribution of quality seeds are i access to quality seeds and ii inadequate research support56 about 30 35 of the total seeds available are produced by private and public sector companies and farm bred seeds account for the remaining seeds18 while farmers can de velop certain varieties of seeds from the crops harvested on their land high yieldi ng varieties of seeds have to be purchased from the market the cost of these varieties is too high for marginal and small farmers to afford thus disincentivising them fr om purchasing these varieties 43 the economic survey 2015 16 has recommended bringing in more players into the production of seeds to improve th eir availability in the market and also reduce their prices agricultural machinery mechanization is another aspect with a significant impact on agricultural productivity the use of agricultural machinery in agriculture enables agricultural labour to be used in other activities it makes activities such as tilling spreading of seeds and fertilizers and harvesting more efficient so that the cost of inputs is offset it c an also make the use of labour in agriculture more cost effective the status of mechanisation in agriculture varies for different activities although the overall level of mechanisation is still less than 50 as compared to 90 in developed countries62 the highest level of mechanisation 60 70 is observed in harvesting and threshing activities and irrigation 37 the lowest level of mechanisation is found in seeding and planting to increase productivity farm genetically modified seed varieties genetically modified gm seeds are those where certain genes are modified to develop traits such as a resistance to pests and herbicide and increased productivity bt cotton is currently the only approved gm technology seed in india it was adopted in india in 2002 and as of 2014 92 of the area covered by cotton uses bt cotton57 after releasing bt cotton in the country the crops yield increased f rom 190 kgha in 2000 01 to 461 kgha in 2014 1558 over the years various gm crops such as bt brinjal have been developed but they have not received the regulatory approval to be released in indian markets under the existing regulatory process the genetic engineering appraisal committee geac under the ministry of environment forest and climate change approves proposals for the commercial use of gm seeds59 in september 2016 the geac invited public comments on a report authorising the environmenta l release of ge mustard6061 the ministry of environment is yet to provide the final approval for ge mustard to be released commercially 12 equipment which is durable light weight and low cost and also specific to different crops and regions should be made available for small and marginal farmers62 some challenges fac ed by farm mechanisation include different soil and climatic zones which require customised farm machinery and small land holdings with lack of access to resources mechanisation should aim to increase agricultural efficiency by reducing the time and lab our requirement minimising wastage and reducing costs of labour63 postharvest activities storage facilities after agricultural produce is harvested it requires a robust storage infrastructure in order to minimise any losses due to adverse weather conditions or in the process of transportation the quantity of food which is wasted during the harvest and post harvest processes in the country has increased over the past five years 18 the highest losses are observed in the case of fruits and vegetables 4 6159 of production in 2015 pulses 64 84 and oilseeds 53 99 food wastage occurs at all levels of farming the farmer transporter wholesaler and retailer some of the reasons for this wastage are crop damage improper harvesting techn iques poor packaging and transportation and poor storage some of the issues with the state of storage facilities in the country are inadequate capacity and poor conditions of storage64 in cases where the storage capacity is found to be sufficient the conditions of the godown are unfit either because of the damp condition of the storage or because of its remote location food grains from the central pool are stored in warehouses manage d by the centra l warehousing corporation cwc under the department of food and public distribution as of december 2016 the cwc was operating 438 warehouses with a total capacity of 97 million tonnes state warehousing corporations manage storage facilities at the state level as of december 2016 19 such swcs were operating 1757 warehouses with a total capacity of 26 million tonnes65 another system for the storage of agricultural commodities is th e negotiable warehousing system regulated by the warehousing regulatory and development authority under this system farmers who store the ir produce are issued a receipt with details of the location of the warehouse and the quality and quantity of the produce being stored this receipt acts a collateral in case the farmer wants to access agricultural credi t66 as of 2015 a storage capacity of 118 million tonnes was with warehouses registered with the wrda of this 19 million tonne was with the private sector 15 million tonne with the co operative sector and the remaining with government storage67 since foodstuffs such as certain fruits and vegetables deteriorate faster and lead to wastage they are stored at cold temperatures to reduce their perishability68 cold storage facilities in the country were set up by the cold storage order 1964 under the essential commodities act 1955 some challenges identified in the development of cold storage in the country are delays in the process of changing land use fro m agriculture to industrial use lack of tax exemptions accrued to cold storage for agricultural commodities availability of power and accessibility to farmers69 mega food parks the mega food parks scheme was launched by the ministry of food processing i ndustries in 200870 the scheme aims to create a mechanism of linking agricultural production to the markets by involving farmers processors and retailers together in a cluster based approach expected outcomes of the scheme would be a higher price for farmers from their produce creation of high quality food processing infrastructure reduction in food wastage and creation of an efficient food supply chain among others the scheme is being implemented through a special purpose vehicle set up under th e companies act 2013 as of july 2016 42 mega food parks were sanctioned by the ministry of which 38 have been approved for implementation and 8 are operational71 13 agricultural pricing procurement of agricultural commodities is the purchase of food grains by the central or state governments the food corporation of india is responsible for the purchase storage movement distribution and sale of agricultural produce72 minimum support prices are the prices at which the government purchases food grains from farmers the largest procurement at msps is for rice and wheat about a third of the wheat and rice produced in the count ry is procured by the central government in 2015 16 33 of the wheat and 30 of the rice produced in the country was procured by the central government note that india is a big exporter of wheat in 2014 15 of the 908 million tonnes of wheat produced in the country 28 million tonnes was pro cured for the central pool and 29 million tonnes was exported minimum support prices msps msps are the prices at which the central government purchases food grains from farmers msps are fixed by the central government in order to ensure remunerativ e prices to farmers factors taken into consideration in determining msps include costs of cultivation and production productivity of crops and market prices73 high msps of crops provide incentives to farmers to adopt modern technologies and farming practices to increase the overall productivity of their crops the government announces msps for 22 crops and a fair and remunerative price for sugarcane but the public distributi on system for which grains are procured primarily distributes wheat and rice to its beneficiaries since procurement is mainly carried out for wheat and rice farmers have focused on the cultivation of these crops over other crops such as puls es and oil seeds 37 table 17 in the annexure shows the msps for crops from 2005 06 to 2015 16 effectiveness of msps although msps are declared for various crops procurement at these prices mainly happens for wheat rice sugarcane and cotton in a few states 74 as a result in procuring states farmers focus on cultivating these crops over other crops such as pulses oilseeds and coarse grains msps are declared prior to each sowing season in june and october so that farmers are aware of the minimum price the government will offer for their produce this is meant to encourage them to increase their investment in the production of crops74 in a report to measure the efficacy of msps the niti aayog found that a low proportion of farmers 10 was aware of msps before the sowing season 62 of the farmers were informed of m sps after sowing their crops the pricing policy of msps would be effective only if farmers are aware of it at the time of deciding what crops to grow the niti aayog recommended that the awareness level of farmers regarding msps must be increased and the mediums of dissemination of thi s information must be strengthened74 other issues with the implementation of the msp regime include long distances to the procurement centres increasing cost of transportation for farmers irregular hours of the procurement centres lack of coverage storage godowns and inadequate storage capacity and delays in the payment of msps to farmers74 the niti aayog notes that the agricultural pricing policy needs to be reviewed to ensure that farmers are receiving remunerat ive prices for thei r produce one o f the measures it recommends is a price deficiency system under such a system farmers would be compensated for certain commodities if their prices fall under a specified threshold this would reduce stock holding by farmers who store commodities until prices increase and also incentivise farmers to produce different crops farmers would be paid by using the direct benefit transfer system through bank accounts linked to the their aadhaar numbers 14 agricultural markets the production supply and distribution of certain commodities come s under the purview o f the essential commodities act 1955 75 these commodities include food grains oilseeds cotton and woollen textiles jute and coal among others under the act the central government may control the price at which any essential commodity is traded i t may also regulate licenses for its storage transport distribution disposal or consumption agricultural markets in the country are regulated by state agricultural produce marketing committee apmc laws76 under these state acts farmers are required to sell thei r produce at state owned mandis over the years several issues have been highlighted in this system for instance apmc mandis currently levy a market fee on farmers who wish to sell their produce in the mandis this makes it expen sive for farmers to sell at apmc mandis in addition farmers have to arrange for their produce to be transport ed from their farms to the nearest mandi which brings in costs such as transport and fuel in transporting the produce from the farm to the st ore several intermediaries are involved these intermediaries are all paid a certain proportion of the price as commissions thus the market price which the farmer receives for his p roduce is significantly lower than the price at which his produce is s old to the retailer the central government had released a model apmc act in 2003 to be enacted by states77 the model act i provides for the direct selling of produce throug h contract farming ii permits private persons farmers and consumers to establish agricultur al markets iii levies a single market fee on the sale of the commodity and iv replace s licences with registration of market agencies so that they can operate in more than one market among other things however only 18 states an d union territories have implemented the reforms laid out in the model act 78 four states are yet to initiate the reforms and the remaining states are at various stages of implementing them the economic survey 2014 15 recommended that a national agricu ltural market nam be created to provide f or a national electronic platform on which farmers may sell their produce79 such a market wo uld enable farmers to receive a corresponding price for their produce and also allow them to sell their produce anywhere in the country in april 2016 the central government launched the national agricultural market in 8 states districts and integrated wholesale mandis in these areas to create a common platform80
