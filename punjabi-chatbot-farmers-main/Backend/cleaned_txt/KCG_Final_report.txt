1 i introduction agriculture is an important sector of indian economy as it contributes about 17 to the total gdp and provides employment to over 60 of the population indian agriculture has registered impressive growth over last few decades the foodgrain production has increased from 51 million tonnes mt in 1950 51 to 250 mt during 2011 12 highest ever since independence the production of oilseeds nine major oilseed has also increased from 5 mt to 28 mt during the same period the rapid growth has helped indian agr iculture mark its presence at global level india stands among top three in terms of production of various agricultural commodities like paddy wheat pulses groundnut rapeseeds fruits vegetables sugarcane tea jute cotton tobacco leaves etc goi 2008 09 however on marketing front indian agriculture is still facing the problems such as low degree of market integration and connectivity accessibility of reliable and timely information required by farmers on various issues in agriculture also the agricultural marketing sector is characterized by fragmented supply chain huge postharvest losses multiple market intermediaries higher transaction cost lack of awareness and several other socio economic factors are some of the acute problems being faced by the indian agriculture agricultural commodities produced have to undergo a series of operations such as harvesting threshing winnowing bagging transportation storage processing and exchange before they reach the market and as evident fro m several studies across the country there are considerable losses in crop output at all these stages a recent estimate by the ministry of food and civil supplies government of india puts the total preventable post harvest losses of food grains at 10 per cent of the total production or about 20 million mt which is equivalent to the total food grains produced in australia annually in a country where 20 per cent of the population is undernourished post harvest losses of 20 million mt annually is a sub stantial avoidable waste according to a world bank study 1999 post harvest losses of food grains in india are 7 10 per cent of the total production from farm to market level and 4 5 per cent at market and distribution levels for the system as a whole such losses have been worked out to be 11 15 million mt of food grains annually which included 3 4 million mt of wheat and 5 7 million mt of rice with an average per capita consumption of about 15 kg of food grains per month these losses would be enoug h to feed about 70 100 million people ie about 13rd of indias poor or the entire 2 population of the states of the bihar and haryana together for about one year thus it is evident that the post harvest losses have impact at both the micro and macro levels of the economy horticulture being one of the important sectors of indian agriculture plays an important role in the economy of the country there are several horticulture crops suitable for almost all the agroclimatic zones of the country current ly horticulture contributes 28 per cent of agricultural gdp country has emerged as the worlds largest producer of mango banana coconut and the second largest producer and exporter of tea coffee cashew and spices about 39 per cent mango and 23 per ce nt banana of the world are produced in india the country has recorded highest productivity 254 tonnesha in the case of grapes in the world only 2 per cent of horticulture produce is processed 04 per cent is exported and about 20 30 per cent is lost or gets wasted in market chain exports of fresh and processed fruits vegetables cut flowers dried flowers have also been picking up production of fruits and vegetables in india currently pegged at level of 20268 million tonnes nhb 2008 which was planned to be increased to 300 million tonnes by 2012 goi 2002 table 11 post harvest losses in asia pacific region s no country estimated losses 1 india 40 2 indonesia 2050 3 iran 35 4 korea 2050

likely to undergo changes knowledge apart from the production technologies the extension worker now have to get equipped with market information which requires further training fo r skill up gradation

marketing advice on product p lanning marketing information securing market for farmers advice on improved market practices and advice on post harvest management practices public marketing extension network marketing extension network is required to be formed by integrating the ex tension network already available with agriculture department officers of agriculture horticulture and agricultural marketing departments should be given training on various aspects of agricultural marketing for the purpose of carrying out extension work s effectively and efficiently this will help in minimizing the postharvest losses to a considerable extent enhanced roles of agricultural extension personnel in light of market led extension swot analysis of the market strengths demand high market ability good price etc weaknesses the reverse of the above opportunities export to other places appropriate time of selling etc and threats imports and perishability of the products etc need to be analyzed about the markets accordingly the farmers need to be made aware of this analysis for planning of their production and marketing organization of farmers interest groups figs on commodity basis and building their capabilities with regard to management of their farm enterprise suppor ting and enhancing the capacities of locally established groups under various schemes programmes like watershed committees users groups shgs water users associations thrift and credit groups these groups need to be educated on the importance utili ty and benefit of self help action enhancing the interactive and communication skills of the farmers to exchange their views with customers and other market forces middlemen for getting feedback and gain 4 the bargaining during direct marketing ex rythu bazaars agri mandi and uzavar santhaigal etc advice on product planning selection of crops to be grown and varieties suiting the land holding and marketability of produce will be the starting point of agri enterprise extension system plays an important role in providing information in this regard educating the farming community to treat agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity and accordingly plan various phases of crop production and marketing capacity building of figs in terms i mproved production post harvest operations storage and transport and marketing acquiring complete market intelligence regularly on various aspects of markets regular usage of internet facility through computers to get updated on market intelligenc e publication of agricultural market information in

grading standardization 6 packaging 7 storage and cool chain 8 pledge financing 9 warehousing 10 market infrastructure 11 it in agricultural marketing poor small scale producers are in a disadvantageous position to integrate with the modern supply chain these producers are often the least organized group in the supply chain most of them have small scale operations use traditional techniques depend on family labor and have 5 little capital to invest producers with access to capital techn ology and logistics may be best positioned to reap the benefits as a result of increased competition poor small scale producers may feel left out competitiveness of farmers that allow them to capture increased income by generating potential s associated with a number of emerging trends in indian agriculture including i shifting demand towards high value agriculture and higher quality of produce ii greater urban demand and iii the entry of large corporations into agricultural marketing empowerment of farme rs is necessary to make them able to respond positively to these changes in the market pulse through diversification of production incre ase in farm productivity improved product quality and standards and realization of value addition opportunities the main contact point for farmers are extension personnel working with directorate of agricultural marketing and officers working in the line department adequate knowledge on postharvest management among the office bearers dealing with basic stakeholders is key to improve the supply chain and their by avoiding huge losses that occur in the form of postharvest losses the directorate of agricultural marketing and marketing boards are playing strategic role in overcoming the limitations of traditional marketing system by knowledge management and advisory to the different stakeholders like farmers traders commission agents and other market functionaries the emphasis is given to provide critical knowledge and skills to the participants to enhance the agricultu ral marketing efficiency and also to overcome the problems persisting in the fragmented supply chain the purpose of conducting a needs assessment is to validate the hypothetical judgment with actual training needs to ensure that solution addresses the mos t needed subjects and effectively focuses the appropriate resources time and effort toward targeted solutions training need assessment is to identify the gap between the model situation and the actual situation and the way in which it can be bridged as the gaps are identified they are evaluated to determine the manner in which the gaps can be bridged some situations will indicate training needs some may need non training solutions eg financial aspects institutional strengthening providing the ri ght tools etc the results of training needs analysis will highlight the subject wise need to bridge the gap to help in the preparation of training modules and facilitate in the development of skills of extension personnel 6 in order to have the foundation to develop the human resources training plan for the agriculture marketing sector niam conducted a survey and training need assessment of officers of directorate of agricultural marketing across the country with the followi ng specific objectives objectives of the study 1 to determine the knowledge gaps and training needs of agricultural extension agents 2 to determine whether any training is needed 3 to determine the areas in which training is needed 4 to determine the gap to be br idged 5 to determine desired training outcomes 6 to provide a basis of monitoring and evaluation 7 to assess the training needs vis vis education qualification experience in the field of agricultural marketing and number of trainings undergone 7 i methodology the whole country was divided in to four regions i e north east west and south and the following are the states selected for the study 1 northern region himachal pradesh uttar pradesh haryana and rajasthan 2 eastern region assam orissa nagaland and jharkhand 3 western region madhya pradesh and maharashtra 4 southern region karnataka tamil nadu and andhra

assessment of training needs a model questionnaire was prepared incorporating all the variables relating to the policy issues and knowledge of physical infrastructures the questionnaire so prepared was pretested for incorporating all possible issues to be addressed for assessing the training needs of the extension per sonnel the resultant variables of pretest were incorporated in the final questionnaire and data were collected by mailing the same to different state government officials apart from it the questionnaire was also addressed to the participants in the various training programmes organized across the country and in niam campus the variables were tested on five point likert sc ale to know the relative knowledge intensity among the respondents the information provided by the respondent officers was analyzed using simple averages and percentages 8 iii results and discussion knowledgeable and well trained people and effective institutions are critical for achieving growth in any of the sectors more so in the field of agricultural marketing as it is the threshold point where in the economy of the entire farming community is dependent indias agriculture predominantly characterized by the fragmented supply looses more than 13rd of its produce i n the form of postharvest losses the twin solutions to overcome the problems are physical measures and policy measures the physical measures are in the form of creating adequate infrastructures to prevent the enormous postharvest losses lot of emphasis was given to create agricultural marketing infrastructure during 11th five year plan and market infrastructures are found to be inadequate in several parts of the country the other parts of the solutions to prevent postharvest losses are the policy measur es which include policy interventions to maintain the total supply chain some of the interventions were initiated after the reforms process started in the agricultural marketing during 2003 these include direct marketing group marketing contract farmin g grading standardization packaging storage and cool chain pledge financing warehousing market infrastructure etc these initiatives will help in overcoming the problems of fragmented supply chain in the field of agriculture however these initiat ives also necessitated the capacity building of the personnel involved in implementing the same training is an important process of capacity building of individuals as to improve the performance hence training needs assessment is vital to the training p rocess it helps to identify present problems and future challenges to be met through training and development it is required to find out the needs of individual trainee on which professional competencies should be built to carry out the assigned job in t he organizations a training need exists when there is a gap between what is required of a person to perform competently and what he actual knows a training needs assessment or training needs analysis is the method of determining if a training need exists and if it does what training is required to fill the gap the expectation of knowledge skills and abilities of officials at different levels is different so the ir training needs are also different training needs assessment has therefore to be for different target groups for exactly knowing what training is required for each group 9 in the present study an attempt was made to ascertain training needs of the offic ers belonging to the state agricultural marketing board and officers from the directorate of agricultural marketing the respondents were divided into four regions namely north east west and south regions and overall analysis was also done with respect to all the variables addressed in the questionnaire 31 educational qualification of sample respondents in different regions the results on educational qualification of the respondents across the regions are presented in the table 31 it is reflected f rom the table that most of the respondents were having masters degree 5431 followed by bachelors degree 3756 and ph d holders 355 there were some respondents with matriculates and twelfth

respondents 4772 were having fair knowledge and 1421 percent of them had an excellent idea about agricultural marketing reforms however it is concerning to know that about 27 percent of the officers across the country had a poor knowledge of reforms in agricultural marketing it is also reflected from the response about the requirement of training wherein about 50 percent of them said they need a training to know more about reforms it is surprising to know that about 24 percent of the respondents were not in a position to answer whether they require training or not an equal number of respondents opined that training on this iss ue is not required 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 matriculation post matriculation bachelors degree masters degree doctoral degree 541 0 3514 4324 1622 319 213

regions except the southern region 3913 opined that they require adequate capacity building in this area the reason being in some of the eastern states like orissa and northern states like up there is no specialized cadre service meant for agricultural marketing often p ersonnel from cooperatives and line department are deputed to work in the apmcs and marketing boards for limited period hence they find very limited time to u nderstand the different facets of agricultural marketing while in the southern states like karnataka they have separate cadre for serving agricultural marketing department hence they will be working throughout their service in the department of agricul tural marketing in spite of having an exclusive cadre of services the capacity building of the officers is required to

depicted in the table 33 it is revealed from the table that almost all the respondents were aware of contract farming except five percent who were either not knowing the co ntract farming concept nor were aware of it however the degree of awareness varied wherein about 50 percent of the respondents had a poor knowledge of the concept while 31 percent of them had a fair knowledge and 13 percent of them had an excellent kn owledge about the contract farming thus it is once again revealed that the different provisions and contents of contract farming arrangements are not popular among the personnel working in the field of agricultural marketing moreover contract farming is successful in few regions and confined to few crops across the country the region w ise analysis also revealed that the know how about contract farming was extensive in the southern region followed by northern region western region and eastern region in southern region several models of contract farming arrangements are found to be successful in crops like gherkin baby corn cotton and vegetables this trend is observed in the northern regions like punjab and uttar pradesh for basmati rice and for soy bean and vegetables in western region however the scope for contract farming in the eastern region though exists but limited due to one or two crops 34 awareness of sample respondents about group

agricultural marketing milk and eggs marketing are two success stories of role of scale and technology in marketing the extent to which the farmer producers will benefit out of saving of avoidable waste depends on the group marketing practices adopted by the farmers in this sense farmers organizations need to be promoted for undertaking marketing activities on behal f of the individual members of the group promotion of such organization should be assisted or helped to create basic infrastructure for their effective functioning some of the interventions which have really helped the farming

grades and standards in different regions promotion of standardization and grading of agricultural commodities is an important aspect of agricultural marketing the agricultural commodities are heterogeneous and hence it is very essential to grade these commodities as per standards to command better price either at domestic or international market com modity grading and inspection systems differ from commodity to commodity because of wide variations in the nature of the products production and processing methods and marketing practices for each commodity agricultural commodity graders apply a thoroug h knowledge of the quality characteristics and grading standards for products in a commodity group this knowledge is reinforced by familiarity with the production methods and marketing practices pertaining to these products dmi 2010 grading at farmer s level is not taking place as hardly few farmers go for on farm grading due to absence of on farm grading the farmer is not in a position to realize the right price for his produce in an effort to promote grading and standardization directorate of mar keting and inspection goi has been entrusted the work of developing the grades and standards for agricultural commodities however due to vide variation in quality quantity and size of the produce produced in different agro climatic regions the harmony of the grades and standards prescribed at national level is not uniform across the regions hence a think tank has suggested having bureau of grades and standards at state level 37 tables 312 awareness of sample

warehouse receipts negotiable instruments backed by the underlying commodities are an integral part of the marketing and financial systems of most industrial countries the overall efficiency of these markets particularly in the agribusiness sector is greatly enhanced when producers and commercial entities can convert inventories of agricultural raw materials or intermedia ry or finished products into a readily tradable device since warehouse receipts are negotiable instruments they can be traded sold swapped used as collateral to support borrowing or accepted for delivery against a derivative instrument such as a futu res contract warehouse receipts provide farmers with an instrument that allows them to extend the sales period of modestly perishable products well beyond the harvesting season when delivering the product to an accredited warehouse the farmer obtains a warehouse receipt that can be used as collateral for short term borrowing to obtain working capital that way the farmer does not need to sell the product immediately to ease cash constraints of course this option will be attractive only if the farmer e xpects that seasonal price increases will make it worthwhile

impressive growth over last few decades india stands among top three in terms of production of various agricultural commodities like paddy wheat pulses groundnut rapeseeds fruits vegetables sugarcane tea jute cotton tobacco leaves etc goi 2008 09 the agricultural marketi ng sector is characterized by huge postharvest losses multiple market intermediaries higher transaction cost lack of awareness and several other socio economic factors are some of the acute problems being faced by the indian agriculture agricultural c ommodities produced on the farm fields have to undergo a series of operations such as harvesting threshing winnowing bagging transportation storage processing and exchange before they reach the consumer and there are appreciable losses in crop outpu t at all these stages a recent estimate by the ministry of food and civil supplies government of india puts the total preventable post harvest losses of food grains at 10 per cent production of fruits and vegetables in india currently pegged at level o f 20268 million tonnes nhb 2008 which was planned to increased to 300 million tonnes by 2012 goi 2002 in the case of horticulture crops about 20 30 per cent is lost or gets wasted in market chain exports of fresh and processed fruits vegetables cut flowers dried flowers have also been picking up physical aspects for postharvest management cleaning grading waxing for perishables threshing handling etc for non perishables packaging grading and packing line storage controlled atmosphere storages cold storage and silos for food grains etc transportation refrigerated vanswagons etc wholesale markets with requisite infrastructural facilities policy issues for postharvest management in the changing scenario of indian agriculture wit h reforms taking

management policy implications 1 as revealed from the findings of the study except few issues of supply chain in agricultural commodities majority of the respondents either had a poor knowledge or were having average knowledge of most of the issues hence there is a need to upgrade the knowledge of officers about the latest issues in agricultural marketing by developing an appropriate capsule of short duration and follow up programmes to make it more effective 2 as reflected from the findings of the study that the solutions for postharvest losses are inadequate in terms of knowledge as well as initiatives b eing taken up by different state governments for creation of infrastructure due to over emphasis on production extension the postharvest losses can be minimized by having complimenting strategy of both the hardware part and software part policy part can be through capacity building programmes for both marketing personnel and officers working in the line department the infrastructure part will help in attaining higher 61 returns to the farmers and at the same time consumers will get a quality produce at a reasonable price 3 as observed by the researcher in some of the states personnel from cooperative department are deputed to work in the directorate of agricultural marketing this adhoc arrangement leads to disinterest among the officers so deputed to know the latest issues in marketing hence a separate cadre of services on the line of government of karnataka can be created and thus make sure the personnel continue to work in the same department 4 majority of the states though have specialized trai ning institutes for imparting capacity building programmes in the field of agricultural marketing but lack in coordination west bengal karnataka and haryana are some of the states which are active in capacity building programmes in agricultural marketin g niam being an apex institute has taken an initiative with west bengal state marketing board by having an mou for capacity building programmes on various issues in agricultural marketing in a similar way the training institutes located in the other states can also have such arrangements it is also recommended that each states should have such arrangement and also have specialized training institute for capacity building of the personnel working in the field of agricultural marketing 5 the results of the study uncovered several knowledge gaps among the officers of directorate of agricultural marketing and among personnel working in the state agricultural marketing boards these knowledge gaps relating to postharvest losses needs to be addressed on war footing manner ministry of agriculture government of india has earmarked the funds for capacity building under various schemes the state governments should utilize such opportunity to train their personnel on various issues of agricultural marketing 6 in an effort to promote grading and standardization developing the grades and standards for agricultural commodities will help in having proper supply chain management however due to vide variation in quality quantity and size of the produce produced i n different agro climatic regions the harmony of the grades and standards prescribed at national level is not uniform across the regions hence a 62 think tank has suggested having bureau of grades and standards at state level this will ensure specific tra ining needs in different regions about grades and standards 7 a full training need analysis using workshop approach should be taken up by the apex institutes like niam in order to understand the training needs of the different personnel working in the vari ous departments the present study is a birds eye view of the training need analysis hence it is recommended that workshops involving all officers at the headquarters of different states can be organized and assess the training needs so that the specifi c course capsules can be addressed based on the outcome of need assessment 8 the issues in agricultural marketing such as contract farming group marketing modern terminal market private wholesale markets public private partnership direct marketing etc needs to be popularized by conducting the training and awareness programmes on massive scale on the lines of market infrastructure scheme and rural godown schemes encouragement of these initiatives will help in total supply chain management 63 references goi 2008 09 agricultural statistics at a glance ministry of agriculture httpagricoopnicin gummagolmath kc and bkpaty 2009 legal issues in contract
