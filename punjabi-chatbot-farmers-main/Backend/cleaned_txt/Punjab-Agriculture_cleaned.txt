increase in agricultural production the gross cropped area during the 1980s around 6763 thousand hectare increased to 7870 thousand hectares by 2012 13 gop 20141 the agricultural growth of the state which is largely driven by the performance of wheat and rice production has been diminishing due to the stagnat ing yields of rice and wheat the contribution of agriculture and allied sectors in the gross state domestic product gsdp punjab was around rs 3523584 crore in the year 2010 11 department of planning 2013 the percentage share in the gsdp of various sub sectors in the same year was

respectively doa 2012 2 resource use and status 21 energy the consumption of electricity in agricultural sector has increased from 51045 million kilowatt hour in 1990 91 to 104693 million kilowatt hour in 2009 10 pseb 2011 this increase is mainly attributed to the high use of electric pumps in tubewells for irrigation purposes out of the total of 6 lakh tubewells in 1980 81 320 lakh were diesel operated and 280 lakh were electric operated this number significantly increased in 2011 12 as the total number of wells became 1383 lakh with 226 lakh diesel and 1157 lakh elect ricity operated gop2013 the drastic increase in the number of electric pumps as compared to diesel pumps could be attributed to the free farm electricity subsidy provided by the government 22 water ground water as well as surface water resources are being utilized to the fullest in the state a major portion of the ground water is utilized for irrigation almost 98 of the total cropped area is irrigated the main source of ground water in punjab is through tubewel ls the net area irrigated by tu bewel ls in 1970 71 was around 1591 thousand hectare which became almost double by 2010 11 accounting for 2954 thousand hectare area2 punjab has a very well developed and interlinked river system and a widespread 14500 kms long canal system the estimated value at the present price level of water resource infrastructure in the state is more than rs50000 crore department of irrigation punjab accessed 2015 total cultivable command area in punjab is 4290 lakh hectares out of which 3088 lakh hectares has bee n brought under command of canals networks department of irrigation punjab accessed 2015 however t he importance of canals has reduced over the years due to the unreliability factor when compared to tubewells in 1980 81 net area irriga ted by canals accounted for 1430 thousand hectare which reduced to 1116 thousand hectare till 2010 11 gop 2013 23 soil according to the department of soil water conservation of punjab envis punjab 2014 the soils of punjab are naturally alkaline having low nit rogen medium phosphorous and high potash content the districts in the southern region contain more saline soil over the years due to the practice of mono cropping wheat and rice regime there has been a gradual decline in soil fertility which gets aug mented by burning wheat and rice straws in 2 statistical abstract of punjab 1990 2005 2008 resource efficiency roadmap for agriculture in punjab 4 the fields these practices have not only led to deterioration of the macronutrients like nitrogen phosphorous and potash but also of micronutrients like zinc iron and manganese the soils of punjab are classifi ed into eight major types namely a flood plain or bet soils as the name suggests these are soils of flood plain area of various rivers or streams in the state they are found along the west bank of satluj river from the town of ropar to that of fazilk a b loamy soils these are the productive and fertile soil group in the state they cover almost 25 area of the state and are found in a few parts of various districts including sbs nagar bhatinda muktsar amritsar gurdaspur jalandhar and kapurth ala c sandy soils these soils form under semi arid and warm to hot climatic conditions found in south central and south western punjab these soils cover parts of bhatinda firozepur mansa muktsar patiala sangrur and ludhiana districts d dese rt soils like the sandy soils the desert soils also develop under arid and hot climatic conditions they cover an area of more than

efficiency in agriculture after pioneering the green revolution punjab is now facing the problems of stagnant agricultural yields prior to green revolution the average production of total cereals and total foodgrains was around 1429 thousand tonnes and 1995 thousand tonnes3 respectively at the beginning of the revolution during 1960s the production of cereals and foodgrains were 2453 thousand tonnes and 3162 thousand tonnes respectively there was a tremendous increase in production till the 1990s after which it started falling and stagnating in 2010 11 the production of cereals was around 27847 thousand tonnes and that of foodgrains was around 27866 thousand tonnes moa 2012 3 statistical abstract of punjab 1999 government of punjab resource efficiency roadmap for agriculture in punjab 5 moreover the continued rice wheat cropping regime is responsible of slowly leeching the soil of the basic nutrients and a ffecting the soil health currently there is a soil micro nutrients imbalance of around 70 of the total geographical area table 2 shows soil nutrient health status in punjab table 2 soil nutrient health status in punjab nutrient perc entage deficient soils nutrient percentage

which the soil degradation started increasing at an alarming rate the excessive use of fertilizers is not only degrading soil but also polluting ground water resources at p resent there is an excessive use of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers as they are important for plant growth the generally recommended npk ratio stands at 421 while according to department of agriculture statistics the npk consumption ratio in 1990 wa s around 582 21 moa 1990 this indicates excessive use of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilizers this ratio was brought down in 2010 and was recorded to be 1961 moa

considerable quantity of the fertilizer that is applied transfer s to the bottom most layer s of soil as nitrate due to percolation and eventually flushes into the groundwater contaminating it naresh 2014 the rapid increase in agricultural production has come at the expense of water resources depleting ground water resources are a cause of ma jor concern at the moment which also poses a threat for the future green development according to a central ground water board cgwb report brought out in 2010 based on the data of stage of ground water development in punjab out of the 138 administrativ e

has experienced drought in 1978 1979 1985 1987 2002 and 2004 in the past 4 the indian meteorological department imd in its southwest monsoon end ofseason report 2002 has defined a severe meteorolog ical drought when the rainfall is more than 50 below normal and a moderate meteorological drought when the rainfall is between 26 50 below normal imd 2002 imd has listed the state iamongst the frequent drought prone areas the state also faces threat from flooding and water logging according to the state disaster management plan report 2010 11 the area affected by floods in the year 1960 was around 4638 sq kms which increased to 218337 sq kms in 2010 rivers sutlej ghaggar and ravi are one of the main causes behind flooding the problem of water logging is also persistent in the state the districts which are affected the most include bhatinda sangrur and firozepur the subsidies provided by the government on electricity have led to the excessiv e use of tubewells for irrigation purpose which in turn are responsible for the decreasing ground water table in the state of punjab jain 2006 kaur 2012 pandey 2014 punjab constitutes almost 6 gop2012 of the total tubewells in india while the central districts of punjab alone account for approximately 70 of the total tubewells in the stategop 2012 the state presently has 3271 sq km of the area under tree and forest cover the state in its draft forest policy of punjab as well as green m ission for punjab aims to increase the forest cover to 15 ie 7554 sq kms of the total geographic area by the year 2015 sapcc 2014 another concern related to the forests is that of forest fires which become a regular feature 4 http nidmgovin pdf dp punjabpdf resource efficiency roadmap for agriculture in punjab 7 during the summer mo nths due to very high temperatures and also because of farmers burning straw in their fields adjoining forests5 air water and soil pollution have become widespread due to the burning of wheat and paddy straw approximately 18 million tons of wheat straw and 20 million tons of paddy straw is generated annually in punjab pscst 2008 the wheat straw is used as cattle feed to some extent while almost 50 of the total generated straw is burnt nautiyal et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 on the other hand pa ddy straw which is not a preferable cattle feed has about 80 of the total generated or about 160 million tons

continual burning in the field can permanently reduce the microbial population present in the soil straw burning is not only leading to loss of beneficial biomass but the pollutants i n the smoke act as possible health hazard triggering a range of respiratory diseases kumar et al 2015 4 key actors one of the major players in the sphere of agriculture in punjab is the department of agriculture punjab the main functions of the department include improvement of seed replacement ratio strengthening of seed production and supply programmes dissemination of the most recent crop production technologies promotion of micro irrigation promotion of resource conserving technologies like green manuring in order to improve soil fertility improving the productivity and increasing the area under

relevant to greening agri culture in punjab even though a griculture comes under the jurisdiction of the state nevertheless each state receives funds from the union government through various ministries in order to enable them to meet national objectives for agricultur al developmen t in relation to schemes resource efficiency roadmap for agriculture in punjab 10 sponsored by the center each of these programs has specific guidelines that states need to adhere to the funding for these schemes is borne either entirely by the union government or is shared between the union government and th e state government schemes or programs in the agriculture and horticulture domain in punjab that have complete or major funding from the center include rashtriya krishi vikas yojna rkvy national food security mission nfsm national mission of sustai nable agriculture nmsa national horticulture mission nhm the crop diversification program funded by the union government is being implemented through rkvy the nmsa is a part of one of the eight missions under the national action plan for climate change napcc rolled out by the government of india in the energy domain jawaharlal national solar mission jnsm under the napcc is also another program under which punjab has a state scheme spv water pumping program where subsidy is provided for installation of spv water pumps the demand side management dsm initiative under the national mission of enhanced energy efficiency nmeee is one such example that state is expected to contribute to here punjab state electricity regulatory commission has developed dsm regulations the pilot project under agriculture dsm has however been undertaken under the aegis of bee with some pserc support under the napcc punjab has prepared its state action plan for climate change sapcc with recommendations for each of the eight missions including nmsa national water mission renewable energy development and solar mission as part of the besides these there are broad guidelinespolicies programs developed or initiated by the center that ideally states are expect ed to adopt at their level the draft model bill for the conservation protection and regulation of ground water and the national agroforestry policy of 2014 are examples of policies which envision significant state intervention in the former states are supposed to use the draft bill as a model for developing and enacting state specific regulations although it appears punjab is yet to do so on the other hand punjab has agroforestry as part of its state forest policy and strategic plan however the new national agroforestry policy designed by the center demonstrates the special focus that may be given to this sector again with considerable state involvement in various aspects given the growth of this sector in punjab it may be helpful for the state to develop an action plan for this sector states may also devise their own schemes for agriculture and provide funding state schemes may also receive funding from the union government through specific programs for example state schemes are being implemen ted for soil and water conservation namely assistance to farmers in underground pipe system for promotion of on farm water conservation project for judicious use of available water and harvesting of rain water for irrigation potential in punjab community micro irrigation project in kandi belt and others in the irrigation domain several initiatives for lining canals for improving water use efficiencies are also funded by the state 51 agriculture and soil health draft agriculture policy for punjab 2013 committee for formulation of agriculture policy for punjab state resource efficiency roadmap for agriculture in punjab 11 the draft agriculture policy seeks to enhance agricultural productivity and farmers incomes keeping in mind the sustainable use of natural resources through focus on crop diversificat ion and value addition and integrated farming it recommends diverting a sizable area presently under rice cultivation to alternative kharif crops such as maize pulses and also high value crops table and suggests that appropriate policy infrastructure rd and market incentives are to be provided for this purpose water conservation through on farm water management water harvesting and regulations for enabling water use efficiency are proposed utilization of soil cards and integrated nutrient managem ent are also recommended for improving soil health biotechnology interventions for crop breeding and establishing centers of excellence are highlighted in technology development organic agriculture is also recommended for horticulture in suitable regions as is agroforestry institutional reform particularly in extension services government departments and credit access are suggested public private partnerships are emphasized table 5 alternative crop choices that have been proposed f or

profitable returns due to stagnancy in yields for this reason the finance minister in the year allocated rs 224 cro re to punjab under the crop diversification program for haryana punjab and western uttar pradesh for promoting alternate crops to the paddy cultivation in the year 2013 14dac 2013the objectives of the scheme are demonstration of improved production techniques for alternate crops and enhancement of soil fertility by cultivation of leguminous crops the program sets the goal of diversion of 5 of the acreage under paddy cultivation to be diverted by resource efficiency roadmap for agriculture in punjab 12 motivating farmers to grow maize kharif pulses oils eeds and poplar based agro forestry financial support for cluster demonstrations site activities farm mechanization processing and value addition as well as awareness and training is provided the crop diversification in original green revolution state s will be implemented through the rkvy program in the state as part of the crop diversification program cluster demonstration of alternate crops such as basmati maize cotton and even tree species like poplar and eucalyptus are to be undertaken besides demonstrations for inter cropping in agroforestry under farm mechanization there is subsidy provided for purchase of raised bed planter and laser land leveler technologies that can help conserve water in order to incentivize maize cultivation subsidy f or maize thresher maize sheller maize harvest combine portable maize dryers and community maize dryers are provided under the program soil testing will also be promoted in order to develop site specific nutrient management subsidy is being provided for dhaincha seed for promoting green manuring rkvy also supports and is implementing an afforestation project under the crop diversification program the aim is to shift land under wheat and paddy cultivation to eucalyptus and poplar species in 2014 a target of 20000 hectares was set at a cost of rs 30 crore7 national food security mission doac goi under this scheme there is assistance for the production of wheat pulses and coarse cereals in selected districts in punjab the objective of this prog ram is to improve productivity and area under these crops restoring soil fertility is an important objective as enhancing farmer returns national mission of sustainable agriculturenmsa doac goi the scheme upgradation of soil health labs under nation al project on management of soil health and fertility has been subsumed under nmsa as part of the soil health management component gop

management of forests and increase of forest cover from 63 to 15 there is thrust on agroforestry and accordingly emphasis on providing appropriate models technical assistance financial i ncentives and extension services for its promotion it is perceived that besides facilitating land usecrop diversification and conservation of natural resources agroforestry can and could also serve as an alternative source of bioenergy it recommends developing carbon sequestration methodologies for agroforestry plantations for approval from clean development mechanism authorities it also stresses that high quality seedlings of fast growing species and clonal material from nurseries must be made availab le to farmers for promoting agroforestry national agroforestry policy doac goi the new policy on agroforestry 2014 is designed to provide a new impetus to agroforestry in the country through appropriate policy regulations and appropriate institutiona l mechanism also encouraging industry participation given the growing interest of punjab farmers in agroforestry and its adoption in the state due to presence of wood based industries the national policy is of agroforestry assumes significance for the s tate the policy aims to establish an agroforestry board mission at the helm to develop strategies and undertake various activities a mechanism to coordinate with state level agriculture and forest departments is envisaged implementation of the several recommendations described in the policy will necessitate state engagement these include addressing restrictive legislations8 creating simple regulations establishing a secure land tenure system and also identifying species for agroforestry that are ex empt from the restrictive state legislations decentralized institutions may be considered for regulatory roles so long as their capacities are developed for the same states will also be involved in development of a database for land records and data coll ection for an mis for this sector promoting research in icar institutes as well as saus and integrating agroforestry in state extension services and state led farmer training programs is also key 8
