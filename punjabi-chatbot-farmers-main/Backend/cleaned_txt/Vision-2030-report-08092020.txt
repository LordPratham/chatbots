the future of indian agriculture food systems vision 2030 1foreword jinesh shah and mark kahn managing partners omnivore what will agriculture look like in 2030 we asked ourselves we wanted to think beyond 2020 beyond covid 19 beyond our second fund one decade into the future why because indian agriculture and food systems need to be reformed disrupted and rebuilt agriculture must become profitable for indias 130 million farmers and their families farmers must be made more resilient capable of thriving from season to season indias food systems must produce more than just calories and deliver complete nutrition for all environmental impacts from agriculture must be reduced and sustainable solutions prioritized at omnivore we believe agritech entrepreneurs will lead this change driving a transformation in indian agriculture towards profitability resilience nutrit ion and sustainability we know these brave founders and their teams will leverage innovation technology and persistence to remake theworld around us but what will it look like in 2030 agriculture is a commodity industry so can growth truly be exponential how will technology social and ecological trends impa ct indian agriculture we asked leading experts technologists researchers policymakers and entrepreneurs we did our own analysis and extrapolated the an swers this report details some of our findings their implications and likely scenarios it is deliberately a bold vision we see tremendous opportunities andrisks ahead and the worst mistake we can make is to assume that change will be incremental we hope that this report will spur debate and action we know that together we can reinvent indian agriculture and food syst ems and build a better world 2acknowledgements the study isbuilt ontheadvice and inputs ofarange ofexperts entrepreneurs and advisors inthe agricultural ecosystem inindia and abroad who added practical knowledge and experience tostatistical trends reported widely together

prajapat mr peeyush pallava mrpankaj khandelwal andmraditya sethi we would like to thank the author of this report umang prabhakar for his efforts studying and analysing a comprehensive list of ideas and trends in agriculture engaging deeply with the aforementioned list of stakeholders and then synthesizing his learnings into the content of this report his efforts would be incomplete without the support of his team members aviral marwal and maitreyi menon who supported him on various parts of data collection and analysis for this study finally it would be remiss not to mention the guidance and vision of the people who envisaged this product at omnivore namely jinesh shah subinder khurana and mark kahn and the entire omnivore team who helped brainstorm ideas and offered the author tactical support throughout the study finally we want to thank the cdc group for their support 3 this report was sponsored by cdc plus which is funded by uk aid from the uk government this report has been prepared by omnivore and as such does not necessarily reflect the opinions of cdc groupthe vision we present in this report is consciously bold and is meant to approach opportunities and challenges in food and agriculture systems in india with radical ideas this study was initiated in early 2020 five years into the period that has seen the biggest growth of startups and venture funding in the space it is built on a philosophy of optimism for the future and belief in the importance of disruption of the status quo we have focused on ideas that can have an outsized impact on the lives of farmers and consumers despite significant investments and behaviour changes required these activities will tackle critical problems of the future climate change population growth and shrinking biodiversity that may not appear as apparent to some today but are fast at work behind the scenes some of the trends covered here may seem overly ambitious but as they say we often tend to overestimate change in the short term but underestimate it in the long run we predict that the compounding effects of technology over the next ten years particularly in computing and life sciences will be remarkable for this reason trends in this report have been formed with a sense of certainty as we believe this is the only way to inspire action and cooperation as a result some assumptions we have made could prove wrong due to unforeseen events that occur this decade this is a risk we are willing to take that said we are cognizant of the many systemic issues that underlie the agricultural sector that require more than just technological disruption driven by the private sector we believe issues such as social equity gender equality and environmental justice are critical pillars of agricultural and societal progress and areas where india must make giant leaps in the coming years given the volumes of work being published in these areas by experts in the field we do not go into them in detail in this report this study was commissioned before the onset of the covid 19 pandemic and therefore not written with consideration to post covid systems however the authors of this report were able to input early observations of the pandemic into this report and review its effects on the trends outlined here we believe these trends remain equally relevant for the future as a matter of fact many of the trends in this study have been accelerated by the pandemic particularly those associated with digitalization food safety and traceability the governments agriculture specific ordinances announced during covid to deregulate apmc and eca have also contributed to this acceleration however some trends may need greater gestation time due to impacts on the cash flows of agricultural businesses workers and financial institutions all in all this pandemic serves us with a thorough reminder of the urgency of improving our food systems for a brighter better tomorrow 4the

the current focus on high income groups and menconsumer demand for meat is rising while plant sources of protein are viable and nutritious alternatives to meat they are unlikely to substitute the growth in meat consumption this decade due to the dietary aspirations of the enormous middle class in india animal protein production will continue to play a key role in improving farmer livelihoods livestock currently contributes a quarter of the total agricultural gdp and 6 of the countrys gdp india is also the second largest producer of fish in the world which is its top agricultural export currently milk is the largest contributor of protein by volume which means technological intervention in milk production and processing can increase protein delivery at a lowest cost to consumers future increases will be driven by poultry and aquaculture both of which grew faster than dairy production this past decade these value chains are currently prone to high rates of mortality and yield variations due to manual monitoring and management systems by 2050 the consumption of protein from animal sources in india is expected to jump 94 from the start of the 21st centuryanimal protein

consumes 110 billion litres of water in its dry fodder 200 billion litres in green fodder and 30 million litres in concentrates daily its livestock produces 200 million tonnes of co2 annually when combined with other cattle such as goats and cows these figures are even larger despite its huge cattle population the average indian cattle only produces 50 of milk compared to the global average livestock production requires keen attention to research on diseases and biology in addition to reducing its environmental footprint production increases need to grapple with twin challenges of

estimated to see a 6 10 drop in yields lower protein and micronutrient content of wheat and increased amylase content of rice making it harder to cook leading to immense economic and nutritional stress for farmers and low income consumers 4other crops are likely to benefit from greater carbon concentrations including potato and mustard meaning sticky cropping patterns will have to become far more responsive and adaptive to environmental change 5in addition to direct impacts on yields of food products climate change will also lead to poorer working conditions of farmers on the field and migration of labour from hard hit areas to safety zones making farm work more dangerous and expensive 6in spite of all these challenges india will have to produce 50 million tonnes of more food in
