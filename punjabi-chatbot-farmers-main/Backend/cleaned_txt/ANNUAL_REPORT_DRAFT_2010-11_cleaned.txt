compost is very useful organic manure in addition to major nutrients it also supplies vital micro nutrients to soil it improves the water holding capacity of the soil its use ensures availability of nutrients to the plants over a longer period of time temperature fluctuation in the upper layer of the soil are minimized which help in better root development all these factors help in increasing the crop production however a large number of farmers still do not adopt recommended methods of preparation and conservation of rural compost resulting in production of manure of poor quality and lesser in quantity therefore in order to educate the farmers about the importance and utility of production and conservation of rural compost on scientific lines and improving its quality quantity rural compost work was carried out in the state under nonplan scheme during the year under report there was a provision of one compost inspector each for 64 blocks of the state under this scheme however with the help of staff provided under other schemes of the department of agriculture rural compost programme was carried out in whole of the state composting of urban waste is a sound system from the point of view of sanitation as well as supply of rich organic matter to the soil in order to achieve this objective all the municipal committeesmunicipal corporationsnotified area committees in the state were advised to conserve urban waste property and supply town compost to the farmers at reasonable rate under the rural compost scheme rs 6615 lac was allotted during 2011 12 the expenditure

irrigation scheme the tubewell section of engineering wing of the department of agriculture punjab executes the works relating to exploration of ground water installation of standard tubewells for the farmers and also provides extension services to farmers regarding latest developments in tubewell technology and for better farm irrigation water management in addition it also undertakes the following activities 1 to install standard tube wells on farmers fields in the state on custom basis at very competitive rates to check the private boring companies from exploiting the farmers 2 to ensure assured irrigation digging of custom bores is taken up in the inaccessible areas where no concrete information is available on the quality of underground water and where private boring companies do not take up drilling work 3 to design the screenfilter of tube wells for lasting efficient use of tube wells by analyzing the strata obtained during boring 4 to develop the idle tube wells not in working condition with the help of compressors so that the tube wells can again be used efficiently 5 to develop the newly installed tube wells by the farmers so that their working efficiency is increased ie more area is irrigated with lesser input of energy 6 to advise the farmers in the state on proper selection of motor and pumping set so that overall pumping efficiency improves to guide the farmers for maintenance and proper upkeep of the pumping motor sets and diesel engines the achievements made with respect to the above mentioned objectives in the year 201112 are listed as below a installation of tube wells using power rigs in the kandi areas of the state which include hoshiarpur gurdaspur ropar nawan shahar and some parts of patiala the installation of 28 tube well may or may not be successful because of which the small and marginal farmers cannot install tube well without the help from state government similar situation prevails in the southwest districts of the state ie ferozpur faridkot mukatsar bathinda and mansa where the ground water is not fit for irrigation for ensuring proper irrigation to find new sources of irrigation water and for finding quality irrigation water deep bores are drilled and deep tube wells are being installed the quality of water is studied through sample tests under this scheme for the year 201112 a total of 41 deep tubewells were installed against a target of 55 the technical data of the tube wells has been collected for future planning and use these tube wells will help in irrigating approximately 820 acres of agriculture land b development of tubewells different capacities of screw air compressors are available with the department which are used for development of tube wells and rejuvenating of old tube wells because of increased efficiency due to development discharge of tubewells is increased and a lot of energy is saved during operation of tube well during the year 201011 against a target of development of 150 tube wells 141 tube wells were developed d extension services under the scheme training is imparted to the farmers and staff of private companies and technical staff about the

constraints in transfer of new agriculture technology under field conditions the scheme sample survey for the study of constraints in transfer of new agricultural technology under field conditions was started in hoshiarpur district during 198485 since then it has become a regular feature of the statistical section of the department to conduct periodical surveys in both the season ie kharif and rabi every year the main purpose of the scheme is to study the problemsconstraints faced by the farmers as well as the extension agencies in the field while adopting the new agricultural technology under the scheme two types of enquiries ie agronomic agri economic survey and yield estimation survey work conducted during the year under first enquiry 400 cultivators were canvassed in 50 randomly selected villages in both the season ie kharif rabi under the second enquiry cropcutting experiments were conducted in 50 villages on maize and wheat crops the physical progress of work done during
