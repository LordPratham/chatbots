and birahini with gratitude and to my family vijji and raj for their understanding and inspiration foreword the threat of widespread hunger especially in asia where a burgeoning population depends mainly on rice looms as ominously now as it did at the start of the socalled green revolution in food grains in the 1960s growth in rice production resulting from the modern technology flowing to farmers from developing national and international research programs has been matched year by year and country by country by population growth as we enter the 1980s with two decades of rice research experience to build on it is increasingly clear that the need for an accelerated effort to increase rice production is acute real andin truthcritical to world stability the growth in rice production that has kept pace with the demands for food in the past 20 years has come largely from success in research and in application of that research to grow rice in farmers fields most of that research has been done in relatively young national research programs the current challenge is for those programs to growin size in scope and in ability to serve the pressing need for more rice i believe this book will help meet that challenge surajit k de dattas 17 years of agronomic research in rice and his service to the worlds rice farmers make him well acquainted with the broad range of asian rice farm conditions and with the research needs to improve those conditions dr de datta has been a collaborator and friend to rice scientists who now carry the responsibility in national rice research programs he has been teacher and counselor to hundreds of themin both research and extensionas they have been associated with training at the international rice research institute based on his extensive work with the problems of the rice crop in the areas where the crop is grown on his close association with the worlds key rice scientists on his vast experience as a key irri scientist and especially on his perception of the needs to assure increased rice production dr de datta was well qualified to draw from experience and to collect and summarize the information in this book this book as the author points out should serve scientist and student alike it provides a digest of information about rice research and production it also vii viii foreword provides the reader with references on where to seek added information in the labor of creating this work dr de datta has established a permanent link with his colleagues of today and the rice scientists of the future and has provided a valuable addition to the world rice literature n c b rady director general international rice research institute preface for the last two decades a significant portion of the worlds agricultural research has focused on rice that research resulted in the development of modern rice varieties and a modern rice technology that has greatly increased rice production especially in asia a great body of knowledge emanating from rice research has remained scattered my purpose in writing this treatise which i direct primarily toward students and agricultural scientists interested in rice production was to assemble and summarize pertinent available information from rice research in the worlds major rice growing areas the significant developments in recent years make a complete review almost impossible in a single book however drawing on my 17 years of rice research at the international rice research instituteirri and on the knowledge gained through close personal and professional working relationships with the worlds leading rice scientists during that period i believe the most significant developments are covered particular attention is given to inclusion of the latest available information a factor i deem important in view of the tremendous mass of research done in the 1970s i intend this book for worldwide usage the scope of the coverage by the 14 chapters is chapter 1 establishes the importance of rice as an important food crop and discusses the yield and production of the crop in the rice growing countries chapters 2 and 3 cover the environments in which rice grows specifically the types of landscape and soil as well as climatic conditions chapter 4 deals with the chemistry of submerged rice soils a subject which no book on rice has dealt with in the last two decades chapter 5 is devoted to the growth and development stages of the plant chapter 6 deals with varietal development and seed production most of the significant developments in tropical and temperate rice varieties are summarized in this chapter also covered in this chapter are breeding methods followed for developing rice varieties in various rice growing countries ix x preface chapters 7 to 10 are concerned with the systems of cultivation of rice and the management of land water soil fertility and fertilizer in relation to growth nutrition and production of rice chapters 11 and 12 cover the various agents such as insects diseases weeds rodents and others that have deleterious effects on the growth of rice and methods for their control because this book is intended for worldwide usage it cannot deal in detail with various cultural practices and conditionsencountered in different countries therefore nothing in this book should be considered as a recommendation for the use of any particular pest control practice or chemical in any country local authorities should be consulted for information on local regulations and recommendations chapter 13 is directed to the technology of harvesting and postharvesting treatments the final chapter considers the modern rice technology in relation to the worlds food supply and to the biological and socioeconomic barriers to high yields that prevent farmers from getting rice yields as high as those obtained by rice researchers i discuss also a number of problems that remain unresolved for all of the material covered in various chapters principles are enumerated before practices are described the list of references at the end of each chapter provides an added source of knowledge not only for the research worker but for the advanced student as well although i accept personal responsibility for the information presented many authorities on different subjects covered in this book have reviewed the manuscript to make it technically correct most of these reviewers are my colleagues at irri and the others are from various universities and institutions in the united states the netherlands india sri lanka thailand and the philippines i hope this book will serve as a textbook for courses on cereal crops especially rice and as a reference for agricultural scientists and development workers interested in the science of rice los baos philippines january 1981 surajit k d e datta acknowledgments in writing this book i have consulted many of my colleagues at irri and elsewhere it is impossible for me to acknowledge

fertility and water came to earth to provide better food for the people who had only sugarcane juice as food vishnu made mother earth give birth to rice and then fought indra lord of the heavens to force him to teach men to grow rice thus rice as a source of life and wealth and as a gift from the gods was born from a union of the divine creative forces represented in earth and water rice therefore was treated with reverence and respect and its culture developed into an elaborate ritual even today the balinese are considered efficient rice growers in the indonesian archipelago the importance of rice as a daily food is expressed differently in different countries for example some people in indonesia believe that the rice grain has a soul like a human being in sri lanka astrologers are often consulted and prayers offered before rice is planted in southern china and parts of india people greet each other by saying have you eaten your rice in japan rice was considered second only to the emperor in sacredness in fact the emperor in annual solemn ceremonies planted a few grains of rice in the palace grounds hammond 1961 money can be squandered by the prodigal and he will be forgiven but there is no forgiveness for a person who willfully throws away a handful of rice this veneration for rice among the japanese people has its roots in mythology and the dawn of history and it is not unlike the significance attached to the food gods by all ancient people the difference in japan however is that rice was in ancient days considered to be the food of the gods and the samurais rabbitt 1940 most of these beliefs and practices have changed over the years but rice has remained truly life itself for most of the worlds densely populated regions the ancient home of rice is monsoonal asia and it remains the area of the world where rice is practically the whole of the peoples diet nearly all of their agriculture and much of their hopes rice is clearly the most important food crop of the world if one considers the area under rice cultivation and the number of people depending on the crop in 1976 1978 rice occupied about 1435 million hectaresmore than 90 of which was in asia india has the worlds largest rice growing area with 396 million hectares followed by the peoples republic of china with 360 million hectares fig 11 globally rice ranks second to wheat in terms of area 1 figure 11 the worlds rice land 19761978 adapted from palacpac 1980 rice in perspective 3 harvested but in terms of importance as a food crop rice provides more calories per hectare than any other cereal crop for example at average world yields a hectare of rice could sustain 57 persons for a year compared to 53 for maize and 41 for wheat the total caloric output of all world food is equal to 3119 kcal person per day at the farm gate with rice accounting for 552 kcalperson per day or 18 of the total it is estimated that 40 of the worlds population use rice as a major source of calories for 13 billion people rice provides more than half of their food for another 400 million people rice provides from 25 to 50 of their total food table 11 shows estimates of persons in some asian countries whose major food is rice note that 90 of the population in bangladesh burma sri lanka vietnam and kampuchea depend on rice for their major food intake east asian countries such as japan republic of korea and taiwan have higher apparent per capita caloric consumption than countries in south and southeast asia fig 12 with the exception of india pakistan and sri lanka in most asian countries annual rice consumption per capita exceeds 100 kg of milled rice outside asia only liberia malagasy mauritius sierra leone guyana and surinam have levels of rice consumption comparable with those of asia besides its importance as food rice provides employment to the largest sector of the rural population in most of asia table 11 estimate of persons in selected asian nations whose

countries there are 111 rice growing countries in the world they include all asian countries most countries of west and north africa some countries in central and east africa most of the south and central american countries australia and at least four states in the united states figure 11 shows the estimated area of rice lands for major rice growing countries for the years 1976 1978 although the bulk of rice production is centered in wet tropical climates the crop flourishes in humid regions of the subtropics and in temperate climates such as japan korea china spain portugal italy france romania czechoslovakia ussr and the united states japan and spain have historically produced the highest average rice yield per hectare 60 t ha in 1977 however the republic of korea took the lead with an average 68 tha among the 111 riceproducing countries 3 countries produce an average of 6 t ha or more 17 countries produce 4 t ha or more 78 countries produce 3 t ha or less of which 57 produce 2 t ha or less and 13 produce less than 1 t ha figure 13 shows the average yield per hectare by the important rice growing countries of the world when rice yield is compared with average yields for all cereal crops it ranks second in terms of national average and world average yields by crop table 12 figure 13 the worlds rice yields 1976 1978 adapted from palacpac 1980 6 rice in perspective table 12

national yields and record yields usually achieved under experimental conditions is to determine the potential productivity levels the world average yield for each crop including rice is generally onethird or less of that achieved by the country with the highest national average iads 1979 however whereas most of the rice crop is used for human food a substantial portion of the maize crop is used as livestock feed south and southeast asia which have the largest ricegrowing area and one of the highest concentrations of people produce only 2 tha or less although most of the rice in south and southeast asia is grown as a lowland crop yield per hectare is not much higher than in latin america where rice is mostly grown as an upland crop both regions grow primarily rainfed rice however south and southeast asia have considerably higher hectarage compared with latin america a monsoonal climate causes more variability in water control in south and southeast asia than in latin america and although drought is a common problem in both regions flooding is not a problem in latin america as in south and southeast asia total annual world rice production averaged for 19761978 was 363940000 tons about 330 million tons were produced in asia within asia china and india produce more than half of the worlds crop figure 14 shows the production of rice by country and percentage production in a given country in relation to total rice production rice science and technology rice is the only major food crop that can be grown under various degrees of flooding it is primarily grown on the vast areas of flat lowlying river basins and figure 14 the worlds annual rice production 19761978 adapted from palacpac 1980 8 rice in perspective delta areas in asia that are flooded to various depths during the monsoonal season if it were not for rice the unprecedented population growth in the vast wetlands in asia would have never taken place in the succeeding chapters the principles and practices of rice production that relate to todays needs are discussed but rice science is highly complex and dynamic to put it in perspective i quote bradfield 1964 the nations that are most advanced agriculturally are in general those that have made a substantial investment in science and education during the past century understanding the science and technology of rice will greatly facilitate efforts on research and production of rice in the coming decades references bradfield r 1964 the role of educated people in agricultural development pages 95114 in american

environment that environment is affected by two components nature which includes weather soil and biotic surroundings the farmer who attempts to maximize his grain yields by the use of cultural practices such as plowing and harrowing and inputs such as fertilizers insecticides and herbicides the soil and biotic environment is discussed in chapter 3 and the influence of man on the environment is covered in subsequent chapters to delineate the effects of climate on rice production understanding of both weather and climate is essential weather which depends upon the heating and cooling of the earths atmosphere is a condition of the atmosphere at a given moment climate is the condition of atmosphere over a period of time climatic differences must be carefully considered when comparing the performance of a rice crop or a rice variety grown at different sites ricegrowing regions the extreme latitudes in which rice is grown are in temperate regions a report by moomaw and vergara 1965 suggested that rice cultivation is limited to as far north as 49 in czechoslovakia and as far south as 35 in new south wales australia there is evidence that rice once grew at 53n in moho northeastern china in fact rice is still grown in chinas aihwei county at about 50 n which is considered the northernmost rice growing area in the world irri 1978 however most of the worlds rice is grown in the tropics and the critical determining factor for growing rice appears to be temperature 9 10 the climatic environment and its effects on rice production the tropical region comprises the area between the tropic of cancer 2327n latitude and the tropic of capricorn 2327s latitude the tropics include most of the rice growing regions in india and all of the other south and southeast asian countriesbangladesh burma kampuchea indonesia laos malaysia pakistan philippines and thailand it also includes all of the west african rice growing areas and most of the rice growing areas of central and south america although rice is primarily a tropical and subtropical crop the best grain yields are obtained in temperate regions such as the po valley italy 4545n northern honshu japan 38n korea 37n and new south wales australia 35s moomaw and vergara 1965 climatic environment the effect of climate on the environment for the rice crop is major basic to understanding climate is knowledge of its elements especially rainfall solar radiation temperature and relative humidity rainfall the evolution of rice as a food crop was influenced primarily by amount and distribution of rainfall huke 1976 for example classified the rice growing world into four distinct climatic environments fig 21 based primarily on rainfall 1 a home area of rice where climate is not optimum but allows one crop at low risk 2 a second area where the mean annual rainfall totals are marginal for rice the onset amount and distribution of rainfall are highly variable here an excellent rice crop can be produced wherever water is provided by irrigation 3 a third area which represents widely scattered rice growing areas where water supply must be entirely from irrigation for stable rice production 4 areas with no important production of rice for upland rice production the influence of amount and variability of rainfall is far different than for lowland rice for example upland rice is grown in areas of heavy rainfall in assam and west bengal in india and in bangladesh but it is grown in areas with low rainfall in madhya pradesh in india the growing season is extremely short and rainfall is highly variable in eastern uttar pradesh in india in upland areas in burma rainfall from may to november can be as low as 500 mm or as high as 2000 mm de datta and vergara 1975 in west africa where rice is grown mostly as an upland crop the amount and the distribution of rainfall are of paramount importance the rain may begin climatic environment 11 figure 21 climate and rice 1 home area of rice where the crop may be raised year after year with no climate modification by man 2 important riceprodwing areas where at least one parameter of climate is frequently less than the ideal for successful crops 3 areas where rice production is widely scattered and where climate must be modified to produce a crop 4 areas with no important production of rice from huke 1976 anytime from march to july it begins later at higher latitudes rainfall is unimodal having one peak in areas with a short rainy season but it is bimodal having two peaks with a 1 to 2month break from july to august in areas with long rainy seasons the region of bimodal rainfall includes southeastern ivory coast southern ghana southern togo and benin and southern nigeria figure 22 shows the bimodal pattern for southern nigeria less important areas of bimodal distribution include southeastern guinea and northeastern liberia in west african areas of less than 1000 mm of annual rainfall the rainy season is from june to october in areas of more than 1800 mm of annual rainfall the season may begin as early as late march food and agriculture organization inventory mission 1970 for latin america brown 1969 reported that 1000 mm of annual rainfall with 200 mm of monthly rainfall during the growing season is adequate for growing upland rice brazil which has by far the largest upland ricegrowing area in latin america has a distinct rainy season that begins in october and ends in april fig 22 annual rainfall varies from 1300 to 1800 mm and 7080 of the rain falls during the upland ricegrowing season the rainfall diminishes in february leading to an ideal harvesting period de datta and vergara 1975 rainfall in most of perus amazon basin ranges from 2000 to 4000 mm annually in many central american countries more than 2000 mm of annual 12 the climatic environment and its effects on rice production figure 22 rainfall patterns of selected upland rice regions from de datta and vergara 1975 rainfall is fairly common this amount of rainfall is more than enough to grow one upland rice crop in most ricegrowing areas the year is divided into fairly distinct wet and dry seasons and most of the rice is grown during the wet season the amount of rainfall received during the dry season is usually insufficient to grow a crop of rice without irrigation because of lack of irrigation facilities the bulk of the rice grown in the tropics in the immediate future will depend on monsoonal rains rainfall data indicate the need to develop rice varieties with wide ranges of maturity and cultural practices that conform with rainfall distribution patterns solar radiation solar radiation is radiant energy from the sun measured as a total amount direct beam solar radiation plus sky radiation expressed in calories per cm 2 per hour calcm 2 per hour classification of solar radiation according to wave length is shown in table 21 only the visible part 380720 nm of the total solar energy is important for

outgoing reflected and infrared radiation from the crop and the underlying surface the net radiometer consists of two freely exposed blackened elements placed back to backone to face upward the other to face downwardwith a thin layer of insulation material between the two elements the elements are assumed to absorb all radiation incident upon them during the ripening period of the crop in the monsoonal tropics the intensity of solar radiation during an average day is about 350 calcm 2 per day which is similar to the values reported during the ricegrowing season in temperate asia such as in japan munakata et al 1967 and korea irri 1972 fukui 1971 reported that in the temperate asian countries solar radiation during the rice growing season is nearly the same as that for the rainy season in humid tropical regions that is 400 cal cm2 per day because the day is longer during the main cropping season in sapporo 43n or konosu 36n in japan or suweon 37n in korea irri 1972 than in los baos 14n in the philippines the intensity of solar energy per hour is higher in los baos de datta 1973 these solar radiation data suggest that if rice is grown under irrigation during the dry season the amount of solar radiation available per unit of time is greater in the tropics than in asian temperate ricegrowing regions in the ricegrowing areas in the mediterranean countries the united states and

least 700 calcm 2 per day is recorded in some rice growing regions in portugal and the united states some examples of range of solar radiation values recorded in ricegrowing countries are cited in fig 23 day length the natural day length or photoperiod which affects growth of the rice plants consists of the length of the period of daylight and the duration of the civil twilight day length is the interval between sunrise and sunset civil twilight is the interval between sunrise or sunset and the time when the position of the center of the sun is 6 below the horizon at that time stars and planets of the first magnitude are just visible and darkness forces the suspension of normal outdoor activities data on day length and twilight can be obtained from standard meteorological tables or books the day length including civil twilight pattern during the main ricecropping season varies most in high latitudes such as in sapporo japan and least near the equator such as in bogor indonesia or bukit merah malaysia fig 24 similarly the day length patterns of selected upland ricegrowing areas in some countries show that greater changes take place in uberaba brazil than in ibadan nigeria

baos laguna philippines is seen in fig 28 climatic effects on rice production in many rice growing areas the year is divided into fairly distinct wet and dry seasons in most areas most of the rice produced comes from wet season harvests in rainfed areas the rice cropping season is determined by the rainfall pattern in most of the temperate rice growing countries in asia japan korea and china and in other regions such as north america australia and europe rice cropping is determined primarily by the temperature pattern rice is almost entirely an irrigated crop with irrigation planting can be adjusted to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions such as optimum temperature and high solar radiation effects of variabllity of rainfall variability in the amount and distribution of rainfall is the most important factor limiting yields of rainfed rice which constitutes about 80 of the rice grown in south and southeast asia for the same amount of rainfall the coefficient of variability of the rainfall is higher in the tropics than in the temperate areas in lowrainfall areas variability is high regardless of latitude de datta 1970 climatic effects on rice production 19 most of the tropical southeast asian countries such as major parts of burma kampuchea indonesia philippines thailand and vietnam receive about 2000 mm of rainfall annually this should be adequate for one rice crop provided rainfall distribution is reasonably uniform even in areas where the annual rainfall is 12001500 mm if rainfall is concentrated in the monsoonal season as is usual it is adequate for a single rice crop unfortunately the worlds two largest ricegrowing countries india and china have many areas that receive less than 12001500 mm of rainfall india with the largest ricegrowing area in the world often has inadequate or excessive rainfall during the rainy season as a result drought or flood and sometimes both cause substantial damage to rainfed rice production china now grows rice almost entirely under irrigation pakistan also grows rice primarily with irrigation riehl 1954 provides a global view of annual rainfall variability fig 29 in many regions the total rainfall is apparently adequate but strong tendencies to depart from the norm add to the risk of rainfed agriculture the tropics can be divided into two climatic types money 1972 according to rainfall distribution one is the tropical rainy or perennially wet climate areas west coast of indian subcontinent coastal bangladesh burma sumatra and kalimantan in indonesia philippines equatorial west africa east coast of central america highlands of peru northwestern and northern brazil central venezuela surinam and so forth those areas generally receive adequate rainfall and are not considered droughtprone the other type consists of tropical wetdry climates which are characterized by a distinct dry season major inland ricegrowing areas of india burma eastern indonesia and some other southeast asian countries also west africa west coast of central america inland areas of colombia and venezuela central brazil bolivia and paraguay in those areas the total rainfall is generally adequate but variability in its distribution causes drought damage to rainfed crops including rice rainfed lowland rice variability in the onset of the monsoon season is a factor that determines the beginning of planting season for transplanted rainfed rice this is because of the water required for land preparation and soil puddling see chapter 8 because of the uncertainty in the amount and distribution of rainfall millions of rice farmers hold as much water as they can on the field by bunds the resulting water depth induces a high percentage of seedling mortality and at times causes lodging at later stages of crop growth variability of rainfall affects the rice crop at different times if the variability is associated with the onset of the rain stand establishment and the growth duration of rice are affected if variability is associated with an untimely cessation at the reproductive or ripening stage of the rice crop yield reduction is severe figure 29 annual rainfall

period control and use of this water is usually impossible upland rice rainfall variability is more critical for upland rice than for lowland rice moisture stress can damage or even kill plants in an area that receives as much as 200 mm of precipitation in a day and then receives no rainfall for the next 20 days an evenly distributed precipitation of 100 mmmonth is preferable to 200 mmmonth that falls in 2 or 3 days in examining the rainfall patterns of some upland rice growing areas fig 22 using 200 mm month as the base line it appears that varieties that mature in less than 100 days would be desirable for the unimodal pattern in uberaba brazil in bukidnon philippines the rainfall pattern is also unimodal but duration is longer and varieties that mature in 100 150 days should perform well alternatively a shortduration upland rice at bukidnon can be followed by another shortduration upland crop particularly cash crops like onion garlic or even mung bean the rainfall pattern in ibadan nigeria is bimodal and monthly rainfall is lower than the minimum requirement suggested by brown 1969 if as brown reported upland rice cannot be grown with monthly rainfall less than 200 mm

agriculture was recognized only after world war ii best 1962 calculated by de wits 1958 method the average daily solar radiation available during the monsoon season in the tropics is one andahalf times lower than that available in the temperate rice growing regions such as the po valley italy suicca spain new south wales australia or davis california but because of his dependence on rainfall the farmer of rainfed rice in the tropics must grow his crops when there is low sunlight intensity fig 211 on the other hand where irrigation water is available rice can be grown in the dry season and the grain yield will be higher than in the wet season because of the higher intensity of solar radiation climatic effects on rice production 23 figure 211 in the monsoonal tropics the intensity of solar energy is considerably higher during the dry season compared with the wet season average 1959 1966 annual solar radiation curve 3 point moving average for los baos philippines solar energy and grain yield based on experiments in texas stansel et al 1965 and stansel 1975 suggest that the rice plants most critical period of solar energy requirement is from panicle initiation until about 10 days before maturity fig 212 in the tropics the correlation between solar radiation for the 45day period before harvest from panicle initiation to crop maturity and grain yield plotted by harvest month fig 213 was highly significant de datta and zarate 1970 earlier experiments indicated a strong correlation between grain yield and solar radiation during the last 30 days of crop growth moomaw et al 1967 subsequent irri research indicated that the increase in dry matter between panicle initiation and harvest was highly correlated with grain yield de datta et al 1968 these results indicate that the amount of solar energy received from as early as panicle initiation until crop maturation is important for the accumulation of dry matter during that period this may be explained from the results obtained by murata 1966 which showed that the accumulation of starch in the leaves and culms begins about 10 days before heading starch accumulates markedly in the grain during the 30day period following heading murata 1966 yoshida and figure 212 solar energy requirements of rice at different stages of growth and development adapted from stansel 1975 figure 213 mean grain yield of ir8

24 climatic effects on rice production 25 ahn 1968 and the total period of 40 days before maturity may be considered as the period of grain production with irrigation the dryseason rice yields in the tropics 11 tha reported at irri should be similar to those reported by best 1962 for the temperate region 125 tha however the grain yields obtained during the wet season are lower than those in the dry season because of the lower level of solar radiation received during the crops grainfilling and ripening stages de datta and zarate 1970 effects of day length rice is generally a shortday plant and sensitive to photoperiod thus long days can prevent or considerably delay flowering vergara and chang 1976 in lowland rainfed rice culture delay in transplanting photoperiodsensitive varieties because of delayed rains does not usually affect the grain yields it is because of that flexibility at the seedling stage that photoperiodsensitive varieties have traditionally been grown in monsoonal asia vergara 1976 the photoperiodsensitive traditional varieties have provided stability in rice pro duction even though their yield levels have been low those varieties produced some yields regardless of lodging typhoon damage or inadequate management practices such as no fertilizer or no weeding vergara et al 1966 in some areas the need to delay harvesting until monsoonseason floodwater has receded makes it essential to grow varieties with long growth duration this is possible only by using photoperiodsensitive varieties but day length or photoperiodinsensitive rice varieties enable the farmer in the tropics and subtropics to plant rice at any time of the year without great changes in growth duration chang and vergara 1972 in irrigated areas and in rainfed areas where flooding is limited to a maximum water depth of 1520 cm improved photoperiodinsensitive varieties have partially replaced photoperiod sensitive varieties using these shortduration varieties such as ir8 rice can be planted in any month in the tropics fig 214 and will mature in a fixed number of days thus it is obvious that insensitivity to day length is essential in one situation and a liability in another effects of temperature temperature regime greatly influences not only the growth duration but also the growth pattern of the rice plant during the growing season the mean temperature and the temperature sum range distribution pattern and diurnal changes or a combination of these may be highly correlated with grain yields moomaw and vergara 1965 critical temperatures for germination

rice plants are sown when temperature is low complete the early growth stages in a rising temperature cycle and after flowering complete their growth in a regime of declining mean temperature see sapporo japan fig 26 for tillering the optimum temperature reported in japan is 3234c matsuo 1959 this optimum temperature is never attained in the northern areas areas in the lower latitudes have highest temperature at sowing time and a slowly declining temperature until maturity near the equator little change in temperature occurs moomaw and vergara 1965 the range of diurnal temperature change for any site will depend on elevation and proximity to a large body of water during the crop season areas in the northern latitudes and at high elevation have greater diurnal change than low latitude areas fig 26 in northern japan a rather low night temperature 16 21c except during tillering and late ripening favors grain production matsushima and tsunoda 1958 higher grain yields in temperate countries than in tropical countries have generally been attributed to the lower temperatures during ripening this is because the ripening period is extended due to low temperature giving more time for grain filling long day length and a high level of solar energy during the ripening period also contribute to high grain yield in temperate rice growing regionsthe united states southern australia and parts of europe low temperature effects injury of rice plants by low temperature occurs in temperate and tropical regions kaneda 1972 reported 20 countries mainly in lower latitude areas where cold injury in rice was confirmed those countries included australia bangladesh colombia indonesia india kashmir nepal peru sri lanka china and the united states injury due to low temperature is a major constraint to rice production in the hill areas in the tropics and subtropics for example the hill zones of northern india have about 18 million hectares of rice land spread over kashmir jammu himachal pradesh manipur meghalaya assam arunachal pradesh uttar pradesh and west bengal hamdani 1979 short cropping period and temperature fluctuations adversely affect rice production in those areas the temperatures in the kashmir rice growing areas are almost the same as in hokkaido japan for example the temperatures during early crop growth aprilmay in kashmir are 39 75c minimum and 140 223c

1902 and 1913 because of progress made in alleviating cold injury in rice satake 1976 some highlights of that research are stage susceptible to coolness for many years it was generally assumed that sterility resulted from cool summer temperature at anthesis satake and hayase 1970 found that the stage most sensitive to coolness is the young microspore stage after meiotic division critical low temperature nishiyama et al 1969 showed that the critical low temperature for inducing sterility is 1517c in the highly cold tolerant figure 215 effect of technical improvement on average brown rice yields tha in hokkaido during the past 90 years from satake 1976 climatic effects on rice production 29 varieties and 1719c in the coldsensitive varieties at the meiotic stage of crop growth their studies suggest that the critical temperature for sterility is about 1520c this sterility is primarily due to injuries occurring in anthesis satake 1976 two factors cause cold injury to ricecool weather and cold irrigation water the common types of symptoms caused by low temperature are kaneda and beachell 1974 poor germination slow growth and discoloration of seedlings stunted vegetative growth characterized by reduced height and tillering delayed heading incomplete panicle exsertion prolonged flowering period because of irregular heading degeneration of spikelets irregular maturity sterility formation of abnormal grains cold injury to the crop is ultimately reflected in reduced yields fig 216 delay in flowering and increase in growth duration are especially marked in modern rice

environment are cited by satake and yoshida 1978 the same authors satake and yoshida 1977a b 1978 reported heading to be the stage at which the rice plant is most sensitive to high temperature figure

in response to critical high temperature for convenience satake and yoshida 1977b designated the temperature at which percent fertility begins to decrease below 80 as ct 80 and the temperature at which percent fertility becomes 50 as ct50 the difference in ct 80 between the heattolerant variety n22 and a heatsusceptible line bkn 6624462 is more than 4c fig 218 it is common to have maximum daily temperatures from 3541 c or higher in semiarid regions and during hot months in tropical asia in these areas a heat susceptible variety may suffer from a high percentage of sterility induced by high temperature satake and yoshida 1977b according to satake and yoshida 1978 spikelet sterility from high temperature is induced largely on the day of flowering within the flowering day high temperature during anthesis was the most detrimental to spikelet fertility high temperature just before anthesis was the second most detrimental and high temperature after anthesis had little effect on spikelet fertility two important characteristics for heat tolerance of rice varieties at flowering are good pollen shedding and early morning anthesis effects of relative humidity the effects of relative humidity in the tropics are generally confused with the effects of solar energy and temperature the average relative humidity before harvest follows a trend opposite that of the solar radiation values for the same period therefore no importance is attributed to the high negative correlation between relative humidity and grain yield however a long dew period often 32 the climatic environment and its effects on rice production causes increased incidence of blast disease in rice in such cases the effects of high relative humidity are often confounded by the night temperature regime which causes a long dew period effects of wind a gentle wind during the growing period of the rice plant is known to improve grain yields because it increases turbulence in the canopy the air blown around the plants replenishes the carbon dioxide supply of the plant matsubayashi et al 1963 photosynthesis of the plant community increases with the wind speed but wind speeds greater than 075 225 cmsec have no further effect on increasing photosynthesis in different plants wadsworth 1959 strong winds such as those that accompany cyclones if they occur after heading cause severe lodging and shattering in some rice varieties de datta and zarate 1970 strong winds often desiccate the panicles of a rice crop increasing floret sterility and sometimes increasing the number of abortive endosperms strong winds also enhance the spread of bacterial leaf diseases of rice matsubayashi et al 1963 dry winds have been known to cause desiccation of rice leaves wind can also cause mechanical damage of leaves such damage is more severe for upland than for lowland rice crops vergara 1976 climatic effects on yield and yield components climate directly influences the physiological processes that affect the rice plants growth development and grain formation indirectly climate influences the incidence of crop insects and diseases and hence grain yield yoshida and parao 1976 to study the effects of climate on yield differences all other factors such as varieties and soil and crop management practices must be optimal several studies in japan murata 1964 hanyu et al 1966 murakami 1973 reported close correlation between climatic parameters and rice yield these and other studies led to the conclusion by murata 1972 that local differences in rice productivity in japan were largely accounted for by differences in solar radiation and temperature during the ripening period harvest index to obtain high grain yields balanced growth at different growth stages must be achieved balanced growth is reflected in the high ratio of the weight of the panicles to that of the total dry matter produced this ratio is known as the harvest index hi tall plants and excessive vegetative dry matter production reduce hi low solar energy and high temperature are detrimental to high hi climatic effects on rice production 33 figure 219 changes in harvest index during dry and wet season plantings of peta and peta isogenic lines from vergara and visperas 1977 this explains why the tall tropical variety peta and its isogenic lines showed a marked decrease in hi during the wet season compared with the dry season fig 219 for the same reason grain production in temperate areas will be more efficient for a given rice variety because the hi is higher the physiological causes for variation in hi within a variety and among varieties of rice are not well understood yoshida 1972 climatic influence on rice yield rice yields are influenced by many interrelated and often diverse environmental and biological factors with the result that it is difficult to separate their effects the relationship between grain yield and yield components can be expressed as grain yield number of panicles number of spikelets per panicle percentage of filled spikelets weight of 1000 grains the main stage at which the number of panicles is determined is the tillering stage the number of panicles is affected most strongly by climatic conditions during that period high day temperature and solar radiation and low night temperatures are apparently conducive to producing more panicles without much reduction in spikelet number murata 1969 in a discussion of the relative importance of yield capacity and assimilate supply for grain yield in the temperate regions cited the situations wherein 34 the climatic environment and its effects on rice production yield capacity is limiting assimilate supply is limiting yield capacity and assimilate supply are well balanced an optimum number of grains appears to exist for a maximum grain yield under a given condition for the tropics yoshida et al 1972 showed that the grain yield is closely correlated with spikelet number per unit land area the filled spikelet percentage is about the same for the dry and wet seasons thus grain yield can be integrated as yield t ha spikeletsm 2 grain weight g l000 grains filled spikelets 10 5 all of these determinants are developed during the reproductive and ripening stages of rice crop because a major portion of grain carbohydrate comes from photosynthesis during the ripening period yoshida 1972 it is obvious that photosynthesis and hence climatic factors stansel et al 1965 during that period are important de datta and zarate 1970 correlated solar radiation during the 45 days before maturity which included about 15 days before flowering with grain yield and obtained coefficients ranging from 50 to 77 thus although postflowering solar radiation is clearly an important deter minant of grain yield in rice it is possible that radiation at earlier periods in the development of the crop may be as important or even more so in fact in an experiment by yoshida and parao 1976 in which ir747 b26 rice was shaded to various degrees for periods of 25 days during the vegetative reproductive and ripening stages shading during the vegetative stage had little effect on grain yield whereas shading during the reproductive stage had even greater effect than that during grain ripening table 25 during the reproductive stage solar radiation affects spikelet number per square meter and during ripening it affects filled spikelet grain percentage yoshida and parao 1976 earlier work in texas had similar results stansel et al 1965 besides correlating yield with solar radiation during periods of equal duration at various stages of crop growth evans and de datta 1979 correlated yield with cumulative radiation for various periods working either forward from the date of planting or backward from the date of maturity figure 220 shows the results for ir8 the slight effect on yield of radiation in the vegetative period and the importance of radiation both before and just after flowering are evident regardless of whether solar radiation was rising or falling progressively high radiation at any stage after panicle initiation was associated with higher yields in both traditional and modern varieties plant response to radiation was greater at higher levels of nitrogen fertilizer application evans and de datta 1979 temperature during the ripening period is another important factor for determination of rice yield murata 1964 and hanyu et al 1966 used the term climatic productivity index to express the effects of radiation and temperature on table 25 effect of shading at different

high correlation coefficients of that index with actually measured yield from their studies it was suggested that spikelet number per square meter was the most important factor limiting yield of ir747 b26 rice at los baos philippines and spikelet number was highly correlated with solar radiation and temperature during the reproductive stage the 25 day period before flowering from the same series of experiments yoshida and parao 1976 contended that a yield of 4 tha can be obtained with 200 calcm 2 per day during the reproductive stage fig 221 thus it is unlikely that incident solar energy limits rice yields in farmers fields in most tropical countries but the national average yield for most countries is about 2 tha and management practices particularly water control must be substantially

from sea level to 2500 m it is grown in the hot wet valleys of assam and in the irrigated deserts of pakistan the soils on which rice grows are as varied as the climatic regime to which the crop is exposed texture ranges from sand to clay ph from 3 to 10 organic matter content from 1 to 50 salt content from almost 0 to 1 and nutrient availability from acute deficiencies to surplus productivity of land used for growing rice is to a large extent determined by soil and water conditions rice is the only major annual food crop with the exception of aroids that thrives on land that is water saturated or even submerged during part or all of its growth cycle landscape of rice rice will grow under appropriate temperature regimes wherever there is enough water to sustain a crop that includes low lying areas in coastal plains floodplains and valleys where there is often more than enough water to maintain lowland rice and where water control must be practiced also included are rice fields paddies on steep and mountainous areas and vast upland areas where rice is grown in unbunded fields wherever conditions are favorable lowland rice fields are formed into paddies that hold water during the land preparation and rice growing periods a number of land management systems for rice cultivation have evolved over the centuries to suit soil climate water supply and socioeconomic conditions of any area however two broad systems of land management are used in all rice growing areas lowland or wetland upland or dryland 41 42 landscape and soils on which rice is grown there are a number of other systems of rice culture where water regime particularly flooding level is variable see chapters 7 and 9 but by origin and preference rice is primarily a lowland crop and its semiaquatic character was the key to the development of wet lowlands in asia at an early stage in the history of rice culture rice grew and thrived in those lowlands without need for extensive drainage based on physiography and hydrology rice lands are classified by moormann and van breemen 1978 who proposed a new terminology table 31 rice lands are categorized into irrigated where water supply is assured and rainfed where water supply is uncontrolled rainfed rice lands are grouped as pluvial phreatic fluxial table 31 terminology of rice lands in the function of physiography and hydrology moormann and van breemen 1978 physiographic bunding intensity of hydrologic and flooding terminology terminologies irrigation category leveling regimes a proposed replaced zero or low pluvial without no pluvial

flooding regime 4 shallow continuous flooding controlled by irrigation regime 5 shallow to moderately deep seasonal flooding regime 6 deep seasonal flooding regime 7 moderately deep to shallow flooding after recession of deep floods regime 8 tidal flooding rice soils 43 in pluvial rice lands the field is generally well drained without free groundwater within the rooting zone of the rice plant this system is currently known as upland or dryland and the fields are not bunded phreatic rice lands whether they are naturally sloping or flat may or may not be bunded and free groundwater is present within the rooting zone of the rice plant during the growing season this land form and land management system is currently known as upland or lowland depending on the kind of land preparation to distinguish between pluvial and phreatic rice lands one generally needs to have information on water table depths fluxial rice lands are located in lower aspects of the landscape or in flat areas and are flooded during the greater part of the growing season these areas are currently known as lowland swamps in which the land could be either bunded or unbunded rice soils rice is grown on a variety of soils ranging from waterlogged and poorly drained to well drained it is also grown under many different climatic and hydrologic conditions consequently there is a considerable range in pedogenetic and morphological characteristics of rice growing soils pedology of rice soils the terms rice soils or paddy soils are not precise enough to be used as the names of a soil group the terms are currently used for soils on which lowland rice is grown and they merely give an indication of the land use they do not give any precise information about the soil dudal 1958 therefore the term paddy soil is not a pedological term but signifies a type of land use the word paddy comes from padi a malayan word meaning rice suggesting it is synonymous to rice soil kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 the specific morphology and classification of paddy soils are unique by and large they occur in low lying lands that are inundated naturally or into which water can be introduced by gravity almost all kinds of soils can be used to grow rice if water conditions are favorable rice soil morphology wherever possible the soil is kept flooded or at least saturated with fresh water throughout the growing period of the rice crop flooded soils may undergo profound changes see chapter 4 for example iron and manganese compounds move from the upper soil layers and subsequently precipitate in lower layers because the process is governed by 44 landscape and soils on which rice is grown their respective oxidation potentials manganic and ferric oxides tend to precipitate separately forming an iron accumulation zone which is underlain by a manganese accumulation zone kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 land surface is modified by terracing in sloping landscape areas silt carried by irrigation water accumulates on top of the original soil dudal 1958 these changes may occur over extensive areas in a wide range of soils and under various climatic regimes thus the morphology of the altered soils shows definite characteristics resulting from human interference as well as those resulting from the original profile dudal 1958 contends that paddy soils or lowland rice soils although they have definite features in common are very much diversified by the properties of the different soils from which they originated therefore such rice soils should not be dealt with as one group due to their widespread distribution paddy soils possess large differences in soil properties expressed in terms of chemistry physics and biology figure 31 shows a sequence of paddy soils in the landscape in relation to groundwater table and formation of characteristic paddy horizons the dominant feature in all these types of paddy profile is the existence of the gleyed horizon which is a layer where soil reducing conditions exist this varies in degree in response to the position of the water table soils in paddies with water tables at or near the surface exhibit intense reduction characterized by the presence of ferrous iron and neutral or greenish or bluish gray soils the color of the soil is one property that can be distinguished in morphological description of soil profiles the color is determined by using a munsell soil color chart with various notations and named colors in the paddy soils gleying persists even though the water table is deep because of the practice of maintaining water on the soil surface during most of the rice growing season the presence of floodwater plus the practices applied to the soil result in a soil system with diverse properties compared to its drained counterpart paddy soils are in general man made anthropic because they have been puddled during land preparation and submerged for the major part of the growing season of rice classification of paddy soils recognizes the occasions when they undergo partial drying even when rice is standing in the field and the fact that water is often withdrawn between cropping seasons the drying and wetting give the paddy soil system a unique behavior which is reflected in cyclical changes of the chemistry see chapter 4 and physics of the system briones 1979 over the years kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 have extensively studied the paddy soils of tropical asia their reports suggest that most soils studied had no clear iron and manganese illuvial horizons and therefore cannot be called aquorizems they remain as alluvial soils low humic gley soils and grumusols even after long years of rice cultivation because of the continuous inundation of most low lying paddy soils the topography does not favor the downward movement of water through the solum rice soils 45 figure 31 sequence of paddy soil profiles as a function of groundwater depth p cultivated plowed g periodically reduced gleyed mottled g periodically reduced horizon adapted from kanno 1956 moormann and van breemen 1978 r brinkman irri personal communication particularly in most deltaic soils because of the very heavy texture of these deltaic soils many wide cracks occur during the dry season the first few rains at the beginning of the rainy season may percolate fairly rapidly but once the clay expands there is little or no possibility of water penetrating the solum classification of rice soils various systems of classification of paddy soils specific for conditions where rice is grown under temporary surface soil saturation have been devised however moormann 1978 contends that soils on which rice is grown can and should be 46 landscape and soils on which rice is grown fitted into a soil classification system applicable to all soils irrespective of their land use with adaptation if necessary where the specific land use has imposed major morphological changes japan was the first country to attempt classification of rice soils as early as 1930 the most widely acclaimed system was developed by kanno 1956 1962 using a catenary sequence varying in drainage system from very poorly drained to well drained soils each rice growing country has in fact classified its rice soils using either a national or international system in those systems no special provision is made to include the classification of submerged rice growing soils dudal and moormann 1964 a modern system of soil classification has evolved over the years and was published in 1975 by the united states department of agriculture usda 1975 in that system are 10 orders their key profile characteristics are summarized in table 32 the five categories in soil taxonomy usda 1975 are orders suborders great groups table

of suborders and great groups are cited however details on the orders and other categories are given elsewhere usda 1975 sanchez 1976 moormann and van breemen 1978 most tropical rice soils in asia are now classified using soil taxonomy usda 1975 and reported in a recent publication irri 1978 other areas particularly the african countries use the faounesco soil map of the world unesco 1974 soil

which rice is grown rice soils of a given country can be classified using the comprehensive usda system soil taxonomy the fao unesco soil map or the early usda system an example for representative philippine soil series is presented in table 34 lowland rice soils rice soils are more readily formed on acidic than on basic materials changes occurring in the latter during soil formation may be less noticeable but are equally important if conditions are favorable lowland rice soils can develop in 50100 years dudal 1958 they occur most extensively in alluvial lowlands where inundation is natural or water is easily introduced by gravity therefore most rice soils are either entisols or inceptisols that have undergone very little soil formation entisols are soils in which the effects of any major set of soil forming processes are so minor that they do not have distinct pedogenic horizons inceptisols are soils that have available water for more than three consecutive months during a warm season and that have one or more pedogenic horizons other than those used to characterize other orders in most cases material deposited as alluvial sediments has been barely altered by the natural and artificial processes inherent in rice cultivation kyuma 1978 vertisols alfisols and ultisols are other soils commonly used for growing lowland rice vertisols are clay soils with indications of regular mixing of the soil that prevents the development of diagnostic horizons and with pronounced changes resulting from differences in moisture content the soil expands and shrinks depending on moisture supply alfisols and ultisols are described later in the section on upland rice soils of southeast asia properties of lowland rice soils the productivity of lowland rice soils is heavily dependent on soil fertility or the chemical nature of the soils soil tilth which is considered highly important for an upland crop is generally considered unimportant for lowland rice however there are a number of physical properties of soil that are of importance for growing rice or for rice based cropping systems physical properties because rice is grown primarily in a lowland paddy soil the physical properties of the soil are relatively unimportant as long as sufficient water is available kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 soil components all soils including those in partially drained paddies are characterized as a three phase system of solid liquid and gas for mineral soils lowland rice soils 49 the solid component constitutes at least 80 of its weight and is composed mostly of inorganic particles due to infinite variations in geometry sizes and shapes their arrangement results in formation of interstices and spaces between particles these spaces are interconnected and are known as pore space consideration of physical properties centers on the pore spaces where retention and movement of water and air occur but the nature of the pore space is totally dependent on the solid component of soil volume and is influenced by its particle size distribution soil texture as well as the arrangement of soil particles soil structure in submerged and completely saturated paddy profiles all pores are filled with water so that aeration is drastically or totally curtailed the water in the soil also referred to as soil moisture constitutes the soil solution considerable char acterization of lowland rice soils is done by determining the kinetics of nutrient elements in the soil solution ponnamperuma 1978 soil texture texture is an expression of the distribution of the various particle sizes present in soils a soil is described as having a coarse medium or fine texture depending on the predominant particle size soil texture determines whether an area is suitable for maintaining a paddy system because texture influences transmission and storage of water flow of air in the soil and the soils capacity to supply nutrients in general fine textured soils are more fertile than coarse textured soils primarily because of the influence of higher clay content and organic matter which relates to nutrient supply fine textured soils are also called heavy soils because tillage is often difficult to perform at certain moisture conditions in contrast the term light soil refers to the coarse textured soils and implies a lesser degree of effort required for tillage see chapter 8 soil texture plays an important role in the management of irrigation and fertilizers small pore size in fine textured soils makes water movement slower than in coarse textured soils excessive application of fertilizer or water to coarse textured soils may increase losses due to leaching or deep percolation for rice cultivation soils of fine to medium texture are most commonly used a study by kawaguchi and kyuma 1974 with 410 surface soil samples collected from nine tropical asian countries suggests that the clayey texture of rice soils results either from the sedimentation process in wide floodplains and deltas or from the basic nature of parent materials in the mountain regions sandy texture is a result of either severe weathering of the materials of acidic rock origin or of direct inheritance from sandy sedimentary materials soils from sri lanka are predominantly sandy and contain little silt whereas surface soils of bangladesh are generally silty fig 32 kyuma 1978 explained that the sandy nature and low silt content of sri lankan soils are due to their development on residual or local alluvial materials mostly poorly sorted materials derived from weathered gneissic rocks the silty nature of bangladesh soils is explained by the sedimentation process of the ganges brahmaputra rivers soils from the other seven countries show similar textural patterns fig

and kyuma 1977 52 lowland rice soils 53 soil structure soil structure refers to the pattern of spatial arrangement of soil particles in a soil mass this signifies size shape and durability of peds and their stability for puddled lowland fields soil structure is irrelevant because the puddling process destroys structure see chapter 8 however soil particles particularly clays and finer silts seldom occur as individual units in paddies even when allowed to dry dried paddies often display a massive type of structure particularly in the hard pan or traffic pan that impedes water movement and helps keep the water ponded on the surface briones 1979 soil structure is usually evaluated by indirect means using a number of indices such as bulk density porosity pore size distribution and soil aggregation which includes stability and size distribution of aggregates bulk density bulk density is the ratio of the mass of a soils solids ovendried soil to the bulk volume of that soil in a given soil mass the total volume v t is composed of the volume of solids v s and the volume of pore space v ps that contains the water and air the total mass m t is composed of the mass of soil solids m s plus mass of whatever water m is present the mass of air is negligible and is ignored in calculation bulk density d b is represented by d b m s v t bulk density is expressed as mass per unit volume normally as gcm 3 the quantity db includes the overall volume of the soil and any change in the volume of pore space resulting from soil compaction or compression will be reflected in a corresponding change in bulk density bulk density values tend to be smaller as texture of the soil becomes finer this is due to the tendency of finer particles to aggregate which results in larger amounts of pore space than in a soil with coarse particles several methods are used for determining bulk density of paddy soils the clod method blake 1965a is considered suitable for dry soil sampled before the start of the puddling process or after harvesting a lowland rice crop for a moist soil a core method is used blake 1965a foth and turk 1972 particle density particle density d p is defined as the ratio of mass of solids ovendried soil to the volume of the solids alone and is expressed as gcm 3 the volume of solids is part of the total soil volume and does not include the volume of water and air particle density is a stable property and depends on soil texture and the mineral composition of the particles for calculation purposes an average value of 265 gcm 3 is used the method for determining particle density is described by blake 1965b and astm 1958 particle density measurement may be significant to pedogenesis and is often used in soils studies 54 landscape and soils on which rice is grown porosity the amount of pore space known as total porosity is defined as the fraction of total soil volume occupied by pores based on the volume of the pores v ps and total bulk volume v t the air filled porosity is the fraction of the pore space not occupied by water and is expressed in terms of total soil volume in saturated paddies all the pores are expected to be filled with water thus the porosity in this case is waterfilled porosity total porosity is seldom determined directly because it can be estimated from bulk density and particle density relations of the soil to calculate pore space the formula 1 d b d p is generally used because particle density is constant the formula implies that any change in porosity is due to changes in bulk density porosity depends both on texture and structure because spaces will form between particles of an aggregate intra aggregate pores as well as between aggregates interaggregate pores apparent specific volume of soil change in the apparent specific volume of soil reflects the susceptibility of a soil to puddling puddlability is the change in apparent specific volume per unit of work expended the change in the apparent specific volume of soil is the difference between apparent specific volume after and before puddling bodman and rubin 1948 where ap after puddling bp before puddling the data are expressed as cm 3 g if the density of water is considered equal to 1 gcm 3 which is usual in engineering works mccarthy 1977 the equation will be where m mass of water per unit mass of oven dry soil or gravimetric moisture content and d p particle density bodman and rubin 1948 soil consistency soil consistency refers to the manifestations of the physical forces of cohesion and adhesion acting within the soil at various moisture contents the forces involved are those bringing about compression shear or tension consistency of soils has been described in terms of friability plasticity or stickiness consistency behavior of soils is affected by lowland rice soils 55 moisture content forces applied or present composition clay mineralogy texture structure of the material because most paddy soils are essentially puddled systems the existence of discrete particles of the finer sizes is enhanced with drying forces of cohesion and adhesion over the soil mass are accentuated and its consistency behavior approximates that exhibited by a soil paste upon drying briones 1979 within the range of normal shrinkage decrease in volume of water is equal to the decrease in volume of soil continuous drying will reach a point where soil ceases to exhibit the properties of flow under the applied force the soil changes from a liquid consistency to a plastic paste the moisture content at this transition is identified as the liquid limit or upper plastic limit within the plastic range the soil mass can be molded to any shape water between soil particles provides sufficient cohesion but also permits sliding between particles with continued drying the mass loses its plasticity and a moisture content is reached where the consistency changes from plastic to semisolid that moisture content is defined as the plastic limit or lower plastic limit cohesion forces play an important role in the consistency transformation of a drying paddy soil mass in the field some aggregates are not destroyed and because of alternate wetting and drying some degree of aggregation is regenerated in this case cohesion within the aggregate intra aggregate and between aggregates interaggregate occurs which influences the consistency of the soil mass figure 33 shows the consistency indices in relation to intra and interaggregates cohesion implications of soil physical properties adequate water supply is a key to optimum rice growth and high grain yield because of the characteristic shrinkage and the accompanying changes in physical properties that occur drying paddies are likely to pose conditions that will restrict root development for sensitive plants cultivated under upland conditions which is also the case when an upland crop is grown in rotation with lowland rice the nature of soil impedance to root growth takes cognizance not only of the role of water content as it affects mechanical resistance but also to the characteristics of the growing root tip soil mineralogy understanding of clay minerals is important for management of rice soils both clay content as expressed by texture and clay mineralogical characteristics have great bearing on the productivity of soils in japan and in most tropical asian 56 landscape and soils on which rice is grown figure 33 relationship between moisture content and consistency indices to inter and intra aggregate cohesion of soils from briones 1979 countries soils with montmorillonitic clay have higher fertility and higher yield potential than soils with kaolin materials or soils with allophane amorphous silicates as the major clay constituents kawaguchi and kyuma 1969 clay minerals play a significant role in physical and chemical properties of rice soils clay minerals in soils are discussed extensively by dixon and weed 1977 silicate clays are classified into four groups based on number and arrangement of sheets of silica tetrahedra one silicon atom surrounded by four oxygenatoms and alumina octahedra one aluminum atom surrounded by six hydroxyl or oxygen atoms the four groups of clay minerals and the number of sheets within the layers of the clay crystals are 1 1 type minerals one silica and one alumina 2 1 expanding type minerals two silica and one alumina which can expand by water molecules moving between the layers between crystal units 2 1 nonexpanding type minerals two silica and one alumina which do 2 2 type two silica and two magnesium not expand between layers the layer thickness of clay minerals is different for different groups and ranges from 07 nm to 14 nm 18 nm for expanding clay minerals 1 1 type clay minerals the 1 1 type clay minerals have one silica tetrahedral and one alumina octahedral sheet in the crystal structure with layer lowland rice soils 57 thickness of about 07 nm example kaolinite in soils containing kaolinite which is a nonexpanding clay mineral cations and water do not enter between the layers therefore rice soils with 1 1 type clay minerals have low cation exchange and waterholding capacities many of the oxisols and ultisols have kaolinite 1 1 type clay minerals according to kawaguchi and kyuma 1969 the soils of khorat in northeastern thailand are generally kaolinitic 2 1 expanding type in the 2 1 expanding type two tetrahedral silica sheets have one octahedral alumina sheet sandwiched between them example montmorillonite its layer thickness varies between 10 and 18 nm it can expand because the layers are loosely held together by oxygentooxygen linkages as a result swelling and shrinking capacity is high in soils rich in montmorillonite it has high cation exchange and waterholding capacities the clays of vertisols are of the 2 1 expanding type 2 1 nonexpanding type the 2 1 nonexpanding type structure is similar to the montmorillonite group but has much larger particles example illite belonging to hydrous mica group with regards to cation adsorption hydration swelling and shrinkage the 2 1 nonexpanding type is intermediate between montmorillonite and kaolinite soils in the northern and central valleys of thailand have higher illite content than soils in malaysia kawaguchi and kyuma 1969 2 2 type clays the crystal unit in the 2 2 type clays contains two silica tetrahedral sheets and two magnesium octahedral sheets with a fixed layer thickness of about 14 nm example chlorite a typical unit has talc similar to montmorillonite crystal unit and brucite mg oh 2 2 layers particle size and cation exchange capacity are about the same as for kaolinite there is little water adsorption between the layers except for few soils in the northern valleys of thailand lowland rice soils in thailand sri lanka and malaysia do not generally contain chlorite kawaguchi and kyuma 1969 allophanes allophanes are xray amorphous claysized materials the terms andosol and volcanic ash soil have been used as general expressions to designate soils that have been derived from volcanic ash and pumice kawaguchi 1973 which soil taxonomy usda 1975 classifies under the suborder andepts the dominant clay mineral is allophane the a horizon of andepts is dark in color and contains large quantities of organic matter the soil has low bulk density high porosity and waterholding capacity because soils containing allophanes are mostly acidic the effective cation exchange capacity is low but cation exchange capacity is highly dependent on ph and in soils with ph 70 the cation exchange capacity is high soils high in allophane fix large amounts of phosphorus in forms unavailable to plants table 35 distribution of clay mineral groups in

and kyuma 1974 the surface horizons of lowland rice soils have the following important clay mineral species 07 nm minerals mainly belonging to kaolin group 10 nm minerals mainly micaceous clays illites 14 nm minerals mainly montmorillonite clay with varying amounts of vermiculite and aluminum interlayered vermiculite chlorite intergrades kawaguchi and kyumas data from nine countries on clay mineral species based on their thickness are summarized in table 35 chemical composition data on the chemical composition of tropical soils suggest that most are highly weathered unlike many rice soils in japan or the philippines soil ph before and after flooding lowland fields is an important determinant in evaluating fertility and management of rice soils the ph values of lowland rice soils vary greatly from country to country examples of the range of ph values of paddy soils in some south and southeast asian countries are given in table 36 with regard to mineral composition many indonesian soils contain low silica and high iron aluminum and manganese soils from thailand and kampuchea have extremely low phosphorus content soils from sri lanka are highly siliceous and low in

1978 details on chemical properties of lowland soils and the transformations of nutrients in them are in chapter 4 microflora in rice soils flooding of rice soils provides a favorable environment for anaerobic microbes and the biochemical changes are varied and numerous however a thin surface layer of lowland soil generally remains oxidized and sustains aerobic microbes the main biochemical processes in flooded soil however can be regarded as a series of successive oxidationreduction reactions mediated by different types of bacteria yoshida 1975 reviewed the microbial metabolism of flooded soils in a complex ecosystem of lowland soils the soilwater ratio varies and so does the microbial population three major types of microbes are present in lowland rice soils in variable proportion obligate aerobes that grow only in the presence of molecular oxygen obligate anaerobes that grow only in the absence of oxygen facultative anaerobes that can grow either with molecular oxygen or anaerobically when supplied with a suitable electron acceptor other than molecular oxygen results of studies in japan india egypt and the philippines suggest that bacteria predominate in flooded soils whereas fungi and actinomycetes are more abundant in upland soils bacteria such as mycobacteria bacillus and pseudomonas and other biologically active bacteria are present in greater numbers in the rhizosphere than in the soil farther away miura and yoshida 1972 some aerobic microbes including fungi nematodes yeast and protozoa have occasionally been found inside the root tissue of the rice plant flooding causes changes in the character of the microbial flora in soils the sequence of changes is takai 1969 aerobic bacteria peaks in few days after the soil is flooded facultative anaerobes anaerobes the microbial flora causes a large number of biochemical changes in the soil that largely determine the fertility of the soil the major biochemical functions are solubilization mineralization immobilization oxidation and reduction for sustaining soil fertility and crop production the important micro biological functions are mineralization and immobilization of elements such as lowland rice soils 61 carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur fixation of atmospheric nitrogen or carbon dioxide and solubilization of phosphorus yoshida 1978 there are many kinds of nitrogen fixing microbes in lowland rice soils a study in thailand identified azotobacter 0 10 4 g soil beijerinckia 0 10g soil clostridia 10 4 10 6 g soil nonsulfur purple bacteria 10 2 10 5 gsoil and bluegreen algae 10 2 10 3 g soil the population density of these nitrogen fixers depends primarily on specific soil properties such as ph organic matter content and available phosphorus matsuguchi and tangcham 1974 the nonsymbiotic heterotrophic nitrogen fixers azotobacters and clos tridia are not very effective in lowland rice soils on the other hand photoautotrophs such as blue green algae and photoautotrophic bacteria are important blue green algae in the surface water and the surface soil layer can assimilate both carbon and nitrogen and therefore do not require any extraneous energy sources kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 recently watanabe and furusaka 1980 summarized the microbiology of flooded rice soils it appears that the kinds and numbers of microorganisms identified in flooded rice soils vary greatly with the techniques used newer techniques result in discoveries of new types of microorganisms such as the identification of propionibacterium hayashi and furusaka 1979 n 2fixing bacteria on rice roots watanabe and barraquio 1979 and nitratedependent denitrifiers among the modern techniques that can quantify and elucidate in situ physiological activities of the microorganisms are the immunofluorescent technique dommergues et al 1978 and the microradiogram hoppe 1977 it is becoming increasingly apparent that the physiological activities of micro organisms in natural environments cannot be analyzed simply by the extrapo lation of knowledge on the microbial behavior observed in laboratory grown cultures rice soils in different countries the soils on which rice is grown are extremely varied details on rice growing soils of the world by country are given in a recent irri publication soils and rice irri 1978 based on the importance of rice and the

raymundo 1978 lowland rice soils in temperate countries rice soils of japan and the united states are briefly described here as examples of soils on which flooded lowland rice is grown in temperate climates japan rice soils in japan have been classified in a local system using descriptive terms such as brown lowland soils and andosols more than 1 million hectares of gray lowland soils constitute the largest soil group in which rice is grown gray lowland soils are widely distributed mainly on the relatively well drained flat river and marine alluvial plains their productivity is usually medium to high sometimes physiological diseases like akiochi occur in these soils intensive soil amendment and fertilization practices alleviate the physio logical disease problems the soil group next in importance is the wet andosols which are hydro morphic andosols characterized by prominent iron mottles in their profiles figure 34 paddy soilscapes on a coastal plain physiography in the philippines

generally acidic with an average ph of 55 in the plow layer total phosphorus is higher than that in rice soils in south and southeast asia because of the heavy rate of fertilizer and compost application rice yields in japan are one of the highest in the world nevertheless for growing rice the initial soil fertility is considered highly important in japan to the extent that there is a popular japanese saying grow paddy with soil fertility grow barley or wheat with fertilizers this is because the response of rice to fertilizer is not so great as that of barley or wheat takahashi 1965 united states the soils in the united states on which rice is grown are either naturally wet during part of the year or they have soil horizons that because of their high clay content mineralogy and sodium content or pan characteristics allow little downward percolation of water the following are the main rice soils in the united states described by flach and slusher 1978 table 310 area by

the rice is grown in aqualfs which are the wet alfisols crowley soils are by far the most important single soil series for rice in the united states crowley soils are somewhat poorly drained in california 23 of rice growing areas are on alfisols inceptisols inceptisols make up 21 of the soils used for rice in the southern united states vertisols about 11 of the rice soils in the southern united states are vertisols they are in two soil series on the lower coastal plain in texas vertisols are clayey soils with high shrinkswell potential vertisols provide the second largest rice land area in california the soils do not have a shallow water table but their fine textures and their smectitic montmorillonitic clay mineralogy make them ideally suited for rice culture mollisols about 8 of the soils in the southern united states are mollisols they differ from vertisols which may have a similar surface soil but do not show strong evidence of shrinking and swelling in california about 45 of the rice grown is on mollisols mostly on sacramento soils which are very fine smectitic thermic vertic haplaquolls problem soils on which lowland rice is grown interest in the vast areas of marginal land in the tropics and subtropics that could grow rice if suitable technology is available is rapidly increasing in south and southeast asia alone about 90 million hectares of land suited to rice production lie idle largely because of soil toxicities table 311 in these marginal lands soils are problematic and modern rice varieties and their technology are not always suitable saline soils an estimated 150 million hectares of current and potential rice lands in the tropics and subtropics are affected by salinity massoud 1974 salinity is the main constraint to high rice yields in deltas estuaries and coastal fringes in the humid tropics it also causes a serious problem in arid and semiarid areas ponnamperuma 1977 in general soil salinity is caused by presence or by intrusion of seawater or by surface evaporation of soil water initially high in salt content some saline land is found along every coast but the extent of affected areas varies greatly generally salt accumulation increases in the drier climates and diminishes strongly in an equatorial climate without a pronounced dry season extremely saline deltas are found in arid areas rice is generally reported as a moderately salttolerant crop but no rice variety lowland rice soils 77 table 311 problem soils in south and southeast asia adapted from ponnamperuma and bandyopadhya 1980 area millions of hectares

generally have a ph 7 they are low in nitrogen low in available phosphorus but well supplied with potassium coastal saline soils may be eutric fertile dystric infertile calcaric calcareous thionic sulfidic and sulfatic or histic organic saline sodic soils and calcaric saline soils are deficient in available zinc thionic saline soils may have problems of aluminum toxicity and iron toxicity as well as phosphorus deficiency histic saline soils are deficient in major nutrients as well as copper and zinc and have other soil problems table 312 hydrology and relief are important in determining the suitability of saline lands for rice production ponnamperuma and bandy opadhya 1980 sodic alkali soils sodicity alkalinity is caused by excessive exhangeable sodium and occurs on millions of hectares of irrigated or irrigable land in the indo gangetic plain in india and pakistan as well as in large areas in the middle east and africa sodic soils are less common than saline sodic soils saline alkali soils ponnamperuma 1977 harmful high alkalinity is related primarily to the presence of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate accumulation of these salts in the soil and 78 landscape and soils on which rice is grown table 312 some saline soil problems for rice from ponnamperuma and bandyopadhya 1980 kinds of saline soil accessory growth limiting factors inland saline soils high ph

toxicities neutral and alkaline zinc deficiency deep water coastal soils coastal organic soils deficiencies of nitrogen phosphorus zinc copper molybdenum toxicities of iron hydrogen sulfide and organic substances deep water pyricularia oryzae cav helminthosporium oryzae breda de haan soil water occurs when groundwater with high content of bicarbonate ions evaporates in strongly alkaline soils sodium carbonate and bicarbonate become prev alent salts and sodium will replace calcium in the clay complex with concurrent precipitation of calcium carbonate sodic soils this leads to the formation of sodium clays which are strongly dispersed and hence highly impermeable to water rice cultivation is suggested for reclamation of highly sodic soils but because of their poor permeability and relatively low mobility of exchangeable sodium the alkaline soils generally do not improve under lowland rice culture moor mann and van breemen 1978 there have been efforts to amend sodic soils in india and pakistan for example by applications of gypsum pyrite or acid acid sulfate soils actual and potential acid sulfate soils cover 5 million hectares in south and southeast asia mainly in thailand vietnam and indonesia there are about 37 million hectares of acid sulfate soils in africa and about 2 million hectares in venezuela van breemen 1980 rice is grown on most of about 800000 ha of acid sulfate soils in thailand and about 500000 ha of acid sulfate soils in vietnam moormann and van breemen 1978 brammer 1978 reported acid sulfate soils occurring near the coast on the chittagong coastal plain in bangladesh and in the southwestern part of the ganges tidal floodplain for burma kyuma and takaya 1976 reported acid sulfate soils at two places on the banks of the irrawaddy river toxicities of acid sulfate soils for lowland rice are mainly due to high level of upland rice soils 79 aluminum and perhaps acidity per se at the early stages of rice growth excess iron is harmful in young acid sulfate soils after reduction moormann and van breemen 1978 although the ph of surface soils may vary between 35 and 45 before flooding after flooding the ph may sometimes rise to 6065 making it possible to grow lowland rice however phosphorus fertilization is essential to get high rice yields van breemen 1980 acid sulfate soils developed from reduced nonacid sediments high in pyrite and low in calcium carbonate are the socalled potential acid sulfate soils less seriously affected acid sulfate soils on which rice is currently grown belong to sulfic subgroups of tropaquepts and haplaquepts histosols histosols are soils characterized by a high organic matter content in the major part of the profile down to 80 cm histosols are highly acid with a ph between 35 and 40 according to moormann and van breemen 1978 the major areas of histosols in the worlds ricegrowing zone occur in the high rainfall equatorial part of southeast asia east and west malaysia the islands of sumatra and kalimantan and west irian in indonesia ponnamperuma 1977 estimated 2030 million hectares of histosols in indonesia in bangladesh small areas of histosols occur in perennially wet basins and also in some deep depressions haors in the upper meghna floodplain brammer 1978 histosols are found to a lesser extent in the mekong delta of vietnamand the ganges delta rice is grown on the thinner histosols containing relatively high proportions of mineral material histosols vary in chemical properties profile characteristics and hydrology the main mineral stresses are deficiencies of nitrogen phosphorus potassium zinc copper and molybdenum salinity strong acidity and hydrogen sulfide toxicity are other possible stresses ponnamperuma 1977 land preparation of histosols is difficult wet soils that are high in organic matter in the top soil layers do not provide the rice plant with proper anchorage and make the crop vulnerable to lodging drainage minimizes some of the problems on histosols but reclamation of these soils is expensive therefore histosols are currently not used widely for rice production if rice is grown surface drainage is usually necessary to ensure any yield at all drainage decreases toxicity due to dissolved organic substances and increases the availability of most nutrients presumably as a result of increased oxidation and mineralization of organic matter van breemen 1980 artificial drainage may cause rapid oxidation and mineralization of the organic matter of histosols causing subsidence of the soil surface upland rice soils the characteristics of soils on which upland rice is grown are nonspecific in respect to soil texture ph organic matter content slope and soil fertility variations de datta and feuer 1975 80 landscape and soils on which rice is grown according to moormann and dudal 1965 soil texture affects the moisture status of a soil more than any other property except topography that makes texture particularly important in upland rice fields which have no bunds to hold moisture for upland soils it is important to consider texture of surface and subsoils subsoil texture is perhaps the most important because it can serve as a moisture reservoir the textures of upland rice soils vary greatly for example loam and sandy soils are typical of the slightly elevated areas of thailands foothills and flat lands but most upland rice in the hills is grown on clayey and clay loam soils upland rice soils of southeast asia in southeast asia the major soils of the sloping unterraced land where most upland rice is grown are ultisols and alfisols table 34 upland rice soils in southeast asia are mostly acidic with soil ph varying from 45 to 58 de datta and feuer 1975 ultisols ultisols are characterized by clay translocation to the subsoil and intensive leaching with depletion of bases ultisols are common particularly in sumatra and kalimantan indonesia and in thailand these soils have a sandy surface texture and a more clayey subsoil the base saturation is low and the clay type is 1 1 with ultisols the clayey subsoil is commonly closer to the surface than the subsoil of alfisols which makes ultisols more subject to erosion during heavy rainfall the surface soil becomes saturated causing runoff of excess water from sloping areas many ultisols have nutrient problems for rice that are difficult to correct alf isols alfisols are characterized by translocation of silicate clays to the subsoil without excessive depletion of bases and without a mollic epipedon a dark colored well structured deep surface horizon alfisols have more clay in the b than in the a horizons and base saturation is high alfisols are most common in very dry zones they are easy to till because of their typically granular surface soil structure these soils have a high capacity to retain rainfall because the more clayey b horizon retards percolation losses oxisols oxisols show extreme weathering of most aluminosilicate minerals an absence of translocation of silicate clays and a low activity of the kaolinite type clay fraction upland rice soils 81 oxisols cover minor upland rice growing areas in southeast asia they are found in lower areas in sarawak malaysia usda 1966 and in the moun tainous ban me thout area of southern vietnam tung 1973 oxisols are the most important rice soils in java they are locally known as latosols oxisols in southeast asia are found on materials derived from highly weathered rock and have few textural changes throughout the profiles oxisols are high in clay contentmostly kaolin with oxides of iron and aluminum and usually have high infiltration rates oxisols are low in all available nutrients upland rice soils in west africa in west africa upland rice is the major system of rice culture the west african soils have low capacity to hold available moisture and droughts of short duration significantly reduce rice yields moormann 1973 because upland rice depends entirely on rainfall for water supply in the freely drained soils it is limited to high rainfall areas with good rainfall distribution the freely drained soils as classified by the fao system table 34 include nitosols acrisols luvisols ferralsols and cambisols because areas with hydromorphic soils receive supplemental water through surface runoff rice production is not limited to only the most favorable rainfall distribution patterns the main soils of this type are entisols ultisols and vertisols hydromorphic soils in west africa are considered suitable for upland rice moormann 1973 reported marked correlation between the depth of ground water and the growth and production of upland rice he contended that surface soils with medium to sandy texture overlying a subsoil of finer texture are often considered best for upland rice because they are easy to till in west africa a number of level fine textured soils have been classified as particularly suitable for rice culture riquier 1971 using the fao classification system considered gleyic cambisols humid gleysols and eutric fluvisols as suited for rice where climatic factors are favorable orthic ferralsols table 34 are considered marginally suited for rainfed rice according to moormann 1973 subunits such as gleyic cambisols humid gleysols and eutric fluvisols represent a large proportion of potential rice areas in humid parts of west africa the inherent fertility levels and chemical composition of soils often explain yield differences and even cultural practices de datta and feuer 1975 a review of fertility levels of west african rice soils by kang 1973 indicated that the infertile oxisols in areas under shifting cultivation cannot sustain continuous rice culture without added fertilizer upland rice soils in latin america most of latin americas upland rice about 75 of the total rice growing area in that continent is grown on well drained soils principally oxisols particularly in 82 landscape and soils on which rice is grown campo cerrado of brazil the llanos orientales of colombia and parts of the amazon jungle some alfisols and ultisols are found in sao paulo minas gerais and goias states of brazil all those soils are dry and well drained most are clayey with low levels of available moisture because of their excellent structures and high levels of iron and aluminum oxides the oxisols generally have a ph between 4 and 5 aluminum saturation of more than 60 low levels of available phosphorus and a cation exchange capacity of 28 meq100 g the ultisols have kaolinitic type of clays on oxisols and ultisols rice responds to nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and in some cases zinc and iron lime is sometimes necessary depending on soil ph and the rice variety and is usually applied as calcium and magnesium fertilizer farmers prefer to rotate rice and pasture on the alfisols oxisols are particularly important for upland rice around goiania and anapolis of brazil upland rice yields in the campo cerrado and at the llanos orientales are about 1 t ha the principal factors that limit yield seem to be moisture stress and low fertility in the amazon jungle area where rice is grown on well drained soils principally on highly acid ultisols cassava maize and other crops are intercropped with rice in a shifting cultivation system de datta and feuer 1975 these soils generally have a higher range of available water than do the oxisols of the campo cerrado although their topsoils are coarser the soil ph levels are low aluminum saturation is high and phosphorus content is low on the amazon ultisols rice is grown for a few years without fertilizer but on ashes left after the vegetation is burned oxisols under savanna vegetation are most prevalent in the campo cerrado feuer 1956 cline and buol 1973 and the llanos orientales of eastern colombia upland rice is commonly grown on soils that have some weatherable minerals and are able to support semideciduous forests in general soils under savanna are not protected by vegetation at the beginning of the rainy season and most losses of nutrients are due to truncation of the surface layers van wambeke 1975 in terms of management of oxisols van wambeke suggested that tillage practices should be developed to increase the water intake capacity of the soils and take advantage of rainfall reduce runoff and control erosion under intensive management systems correction of nutritional deficiencies by fertil izers is essential in peru ultisols and alfisols predominate in both well drained and poorly drained areas and upland rice is grown on both acid and fertile alluvial soils which are not subjected to permanent flooding sanchez and nureiia 1972 upland rice can also be found on poorly drained soils throughout latin america they range from vertisols in cuba and andosols volcanic ash soils on the pacific coast of guatemala to excellent alluvial soils on the pacific coast of costa rica and poorly drained ultisols oxisols inceptisols and alfisols in peru and brazil in many of those areas rainfall is high and drought is generally rice soils and their fertility considerations 83 absent yields as high as 7 t ha are fairly common with lowland varieties grown under upland rice culture rice soils and their fertility considerations rice is grown on all soil orders some are especially important but on others like the aridisols histosols and spodosols rice is seldom grown moormann and veldkamp 1978 in general particularly in asia the wet aquic suborders and subgroups are most extensively used the sources of the natural supply of plant nutrients in soil are the soil constituents rain and irrigation water the flooded rice culture ricebased cropping systems recycling of crop residues and other organic materials and biological nitrogen fixation information on the natural sources of plant nutrients and the scope of their efficient use in rice farming will greatly facilitate the development of efficient use of the natural sources of plant nutrients and chemical fertilizers patnaik 1978 in humid tropical asia lowland rice production depends on the availability of sufficient water of adequate quality to satisfy the requirements of rice all kinds of soils can be used for rice cultivation if water conditions are favorable soils in most countries in asia can sustain rice yields of 12 t ha without chemical fertilizers but with good water supply and good agronomic management in fact most soils in the philippines can sustain at least a 3 t ha yield without chemical fertilizer some soils in the mindanao region in the philippines produce yields of 56 t ha without fertilizer in asia nitrogen fertility of soils is the major source of the nutrient for lowland rice for example in a recent study by koyama et al 1973 in thailand more than 60 of the nitrogen taken up by the rice plants at harvest was derived from mineralization of soil organic matter the amount estimated was a little less than that in a japanese rice soil with low fertility kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 in seasonally wet acid soils in bangladesh brammer and brinkman 1977 reported anomalously low clay contents in the surface horizons this may be explained by the cyclic process of soil reduction and eluviation of cations alternating with oxidation and acidification the process termed ferrolysis brinkman 1970 is known to occur in temperate and humid tropical climates where there is a seasonal alternation between wet and dry seasons in northeast thailand ferrolysis can explain the low cationexchange capacity of surface soils reported by kawaguchi and kyuma 1969 the natural fertility level is usually low the soils are moderately to strongly acid with high proportions of exchangeable aluminum particularly in the surface and shallow subsoil horizons in the upper horizons both organic matter content and percentage of free iron are generally low brinkman 1978 in these soils rice can be grownone crop per year in the rainy season or two with irrigation in tropical africa alfisols and ultisols dominate the landscape the principal constraints of alfisols to rice production are susceptibility to erosion low 84 landscape and soils on which rice is grown available water retention low reserves of nitrogen phosphorus copper zinc and sulfur and the development of acidity with continuous cultivation for ultisols the constraints are low nutrient retention low reserves of nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium manganese copper and zinc and problems associated with soil acidity moormann and greenland 1980 in most areas of west africa but more especially in the areas with less than 15001700 mm annual rainfall with an unreliable distribution the occurence of drought stress is one of the main productionlimiting factors in the hydro morphic phreatic soilssoils that receive supplementary water from surface flow and from interflowdrought stress is less severe or in the most favorable cases not present at all in those soils rice can be grown with proper management phreatic rice lands are mainly found in the aquic wet suborders of entisols inceptisols and the aquic subgroups of the already mentioned soil orders the often sandy texture of african soils may be considered as a restraint to productivity because most of the soils in the wetter zone of west africa and central africa are derived from either intermediate to acid crystalline rocks or from various sedimentary rocks they predominantly give rise to soils with a poor potential for rice unlike in asia the development of ricebased cropping systems with continuous land use is difficult for pluvial rice lands moormann and veldkamp 1978 in latin america oxisols are the most important rice soils followed by ultisols and alfisols favorable rainfall topography drainage and physical characteristics make oxisols and ultisols suitable for rice and other crops but low fertility high soil acidity and deficiencies of phosphorus have restricted

electrochemical changes in flooded soils are depletion of molecular oxygen chemical reduction of the soil or a decrease in redox potential increase in ph of acid soils and decrease in ph of calcareous and sodic soils increase in specific conductance reduction of feiii to feii and mniv to mnii reduction of no 3 and no 2 to n 2 and n 2 o reduction of so 4 2 to s 2 increase in supply and availability of nitrogen increase in availability of phosphorus silicon and molybdenum decrease in concentrations of water soluble zinc and copper generation of carbon dioxide methane and toxic reduction products such as organic acids and hydrogen sulfide ponnamperuma 1972 1976 the extent of these changes is determined by the chemical and physical properties of the soil and by water regime and temperature detailed reviews are 89 90 chemical changes in submerged rice soils available on various physical physicochemical and biochemical changes of a flooded soil shioiri and tanada 1954 ponnamperuma 1955 1972 chang 1971 patrick and mikkelsen 1971 depletion of oxygen when a soil is submerged water replaces the air in the pore spaces except in a thin layer at the soil surface and sometimes a layer below the plow sole most soil layers are virtually oxygen free within a few hours after submergence under these conditions soil microorganisms use oxidized soil constituents and some organic metabolites in place of molecular oxygen as electron acceptors in their respiration causing reduction of the soil the anaerobic condition influences the availability of several plant nutrients and the production of toxic substances in the soil thus the properties of a flooded soil are substantially different from those of a well drained soil in a well drained soil there is enough oxygen available from the atmosphere to supply the needs of microorganisms and higher plants flooding the soil changes this condition drastically air movement through the floodwater is restricted and the soil no longer has an adequate supply of oxygen rice however is able to exploit the chemical benefits of soil submergence because its roots receive oxygen through aerenchyma in the shoot system and lysigenous channels in the roots van raalte 1941 arikado 1959 armstrong 1971 many oxidation reduction systems in the soil of importance to the nutrition of rice plants are affected by the anaerobic conditions that result from flooding in the absence of oxygen in the flooded soil system facultative and true anaerobic organisms become active organic matter decomposition is slower and less complete in anaerobic than in aerobic soils characteristics of the oxidized and reduced zones the differentiation of a submerged soil a lake mud into two distinct zones as a result of limited oxygen penetration was first described by pearsall and mortimer 1939 and first thoroughly investigated by mortimer 1941 1942 using a special assembly of platinum electrodes pearsall and mortimer 1939 found that the surface layer of marsh soils contains oxidized forms of iron inorganic nitrogen and sulfur whereas the underlying layer contains reduced forms of those elements the thickness of the oxidized surface layer is determined by the supply of oxygen at the soil surface and the consumption rate of oxygen in the soil the two layers of a submerged soil can be characterized by the differences in the oxidation reduction or redox potential the various inorganic and organic redox systems in the soil contribute to this potential ponnamperuma 1965 patrick and delaune 1972 reported that the apparent thickness of the oxidized layer differs according to distribution of the various components of the profile chemical changes in submerged soil 91 with sulfur indicating the thickest oxidized zone manganese indicating the thinnest oxidized zone and iron showing intermediate thickness the thickness of the oxidized layer increases with duration of flooding decrease in redox potential after an aerobic mineral soil is submerged it undergoes reduction and its redox potential eh drops to a fairly stable value of 02 to 03 v depending on the soil but the redox potential in the surface water and the first few millimeters of topsoil remains at 03 to 05 v ponnamperuma 1972 the bulk of the root zone of a submerged soil is reduced but the subsoil and spots in the reduced matrix as well as streaks corresponding to root channels may be oxidized redox potential influences oxygen concentration in the soil which in turn influences redox potential availability of phosphorus and silicon concentration of fe 2 mn 2 cu and so 4 2

or pe for rice the decrease in eh or pe pe eh00591 brought about by soil submergence and its secondary physicochemical effects has positive and negative effects on rice growth the benefits are increases in the supply of nitrogen phosphorus potassium iron manganese molybdenum and silicon the disadvantages are losses of nitrogen by denitrification decrease in availability of sulfur copper and zinc and production of substances that interfere with nutrient uptake or that poison the plant directly ponnamperuma 1978 suggested that the optimum level of reduction may be in the range of eh 10120 mv or pe 0220 at a soil solution ph of 70 changes in ph within a few weeks after submergence the ph of acid soils increases and the ph of sodic and calcareous soils decreases ponnamperuma et al 1966 thus the ph of most acid and alkaline soils converge between 6 and 7 after flooding fig 41 the change of soil ph after submergence has been attributed to several factors 92 chemical changes in submerged rice soils figure 41 kinetics of the solution ph of six submerged soils from ponnamperuma 1976 such as change of ferric to ferrous iron accumulation of ammonium change of sulfate to sulfide and change of carbon dioxide to methane under reducing conditions ponnamperuma 1967 and ponnamperuma et al l969 by applying the thermodynamic approach to both pure chemical systems and soil systems concluded that the change of ph in submerged soils is regulated fundamentally by three systems na 2 co 3 co 2 h 2 o for sodic soils caco 3 co 2 h 2 o for calcareous soils feoh 3 fe 2 system for ferruginous soils the first two systems control the decrease of ph in alkaline soils the third an oxidation reduction system regulates increase of ph and its stabilization at 6570 particularly in acid soils the rate and degree of the ph changes depend on soil properties and temperature organic matter and active iron contents largely determine the ph changes of acid soils if acid soils are low in organic matter or active iron or high in acid reserves such as in acid sulfate soils they may not attain a ph of 60 even after months of submergence fig 41 in sodic and calcareous soils organic matter magnifies the decrease in ph low temperature retards ph changes in both acid and alkaline soils thus the chemical changes in submerged soil 93 ph values of reduced soils generally remain close to 70 and have a narrower range than ph values of oxidized soils the stabilization of the soil ph at neutrality after submergence has several effects on rice growth adverse effects of low or high ph per se are minimized excess aluminum and manganese in acid soils are rendered harmless iron toxicity in acid soils is lessened availability of phosphorus molybdenum and silicon is increased mineralization of organic nitrogen is favored organic acids decompose lime is seldom necessary ponnamperuma 1976 the concentration of ferrous iron in the soil is very sensitive to ph changes an increase of one unit of ph from 625 to 725 will decrease the concentration of ferrous iron by one hundred times assuming the solid phase of feii in reduced soils is fe 3 oh 8 which has a solubility product of 64 10 18 the dependence of fe2 concentration in the soil solution on ph is as follows chang 1971 ph fe 2 ppm 625 1114 650 352 675 111 700 35 725 11 750 35 changes in specific conductance specific conductance of the solution of most soils increases after submergence based on studies with 150 lowland rice soils ponnamperuma 1976 reported that the initial conductances are highest in the saline soils and lowest in the leached acid ultisols and oxisols redman and patrick 1965 studied specific conductance of 26 soils using 11 soil water suspensions submergence for 30 days increased the specific conductance of the 26 soils studied the two soils that decreased in specific conductance after submergence had the highest initial nitrate nitrogen and the decrease of conductance was due to loss of nitrate through denitrification the specific conductance of the 26 soils 30 days after submergence was highly correlated to the original organic matter content of the soil fig 42 that was because organic matter upon decomposition produces bicarbonate and organic 94 chemical changes in submerged rice soils figure 42 effect of organic matter content on specific conductance of 26 submerged soils adapted from redman and patrick 1965 ions and serves as an energy source for the reduction of insoluble inorganic compounds to soluble ionic forms reduction of feiii to feii after submergence of a soil feiii oxide hydrates are reduced to feii compounds as a result the soil color changes from brown to gray and large amounts of feii enter into solution phase the concentration of water soluble iron may vary from 01 ppm shortly after submergence to as high as 600 ppm fig 43 in acid sulfate soils the concentration may be as high as 5000 ppm within a few weeks after submergence ponnamperuma 1976 based on their studies with 26 soils redman and patrick 1965 reported that the ferrous iron concentration after flooding ranged from 567 ppm to 2230 ppm ferrous iron concentration after submergence was positively correlated with clay and organic matter with r values of 625 for clay and 674 for organic matter chemical changes in submerged soil 95 figure 43 kinetics of fe 2 in the solutions of five flooded soils from ponnam peruma 1976 other factors that affect ferrous iron concentration in submerged soils are nature and content of the feiii oxide hydrates ph of the soil and temperature strongly acid soils with adequate amounts of organic matter and reactive iron oxides can build up toxic concentrations of ferrous iron and thereby cause iron toxicity problems in submerged ultisols oxisols and acid sulfate soils in the tropics ponnamperuma et al 1973 iron toxicity may also occur in acid sandy soils and in peat soils low in active iron as in degraded paddy soils low temperatures 20 c by bringing about late but high and persistent concentrations of watersoluble iron may cause iron weeks submerged 96 chemical changes in submerged rice soils toxicity in soils at 25 35 c toxic high concentrations are short lived cho and ponnamperuma 1971 criteria for the iron toxicity hazard are ph of the dry soil amount of reserve acidity reactivity and content of feiii oxide hydrates soil temperature soil organic matter content percolation rate interflow from adjacent areas ponnamperuma 1976 reduction of mniv to mnll in flooded soils the reduction of the higher oxides of manganese chiefly mniv takes place almost simultaneously with denitrification ponnamperuma 1965 the reduction may result from these compounds functioning as electron acceptors in the respiration of microorganisms chemical oxidants of reduction products manganese is more readily reduced and rendered soluble than iron the release of manganese into the soil solution therefore precedes that of iron the kinetics of manganese reduction varies markedly from soil to soil soils with a high content of manganese regardless of ph and organic matter content show steep increases in mn 2 during the first weeks of submergence and a slow decline thereafter manganese mobilization in soils is markedly increased after flooding due to the reduction of manganic compounds to more soluble forms as a consequence of the anaerobic metabolism of soil bacteria the amount of extractable in normal sodium acetate solution of ph 28 manganese before and after submergence is closely correlated with an r value of 755 redman and patrick 1965 supply and availability of nitrogen the availability of nitrogen in flooded soils is higher than in nonflooded soils even though organic matter is mineralized at a slower rate in anaerobic soils than in aerobic soils the net amount mineralized is greater because less nitrogen is immobilized theavailability of nitrogen in flooded soils increases with increases in nitrogen content of the soil soil ph temperature and duration of previous desiccation of the soil ponnamperuma 1965 chemical changes in submerged soil 97 availability of phosphorus silicon and molybdenum availability of phosphorus silicon and molybdenum in a soil increases after flooding phosphorus the availability of soil phosphorus increases after soil submergence mainly due to reduction of ferric phosphate to ferrous phosphate although other changes such as hydrolysis of aluminum phosphate and the dissolution of calcium phosphate resulting from the accumulation of carbon dioxide are also involved the ready availability of ferrous phosphate is illustrated by the experimental results from taiwan table 41 the increase in solubility of phosphorus however is low in ultisols and oxisols high in active iron fig 44 redman and patrick 1965 reported an average increase of 21 in extractable in 01 n hydrochloric acid phosphorus due to submergence but there was no appreciable increase in extractable phosphorus in soils that released less than 1800 ppm iron silicon the concentration of silicon in the solutions of submerged soils increases slightly after flooding and then decreases gradually and after several months the concentration may be lower than at submergence silicon in water is present as the monomer sioh 4 whose solubility is independent of ph in the range 20 80 the increase in silicon solubility is not due therefore to the increase in ph following soil reduction ponnamperuma 1965 the increase in silicon concentration after flooding may be due to its release following reduction of hydrous oxides of fe 111 sorbing silicon and to the action of carbon dioxide on aluminosilicates the subsequent decrease may be the result of combination with aluminosilicates following the decrease in p co2 reversible changes in solubility of silicon appear to be associated with oxidation reduction of iron ponnamperuma 1972 molybdenum the concentration of water soluble molybdenum in the soil increases after flooding presumably as a result of desorption following reduction of ferric oxides ponnamperuma 1976 table 41 aluminum iron and calcium phosphates ppm of p in

naoac in some flooded soils from ponnamperurna 1976 watersoluble zinc and copper a decrease in concentrations of water soluble zinc and copper is one of the few disadvantages of flooding soils for rice zinc deficiency is widespread in many ricegrowing countries in the tropical and temperate regions see chapter 10 100 chemical changes in submerged rice soils production of toxins since the initial work on akiochi soils degraded paddy soils was first reported from japan mitsui 1955 numerous studies have been made on hydrogen sulfide in flooded soils hydrogen sulfide in submerged soils results from sulfate reduction and anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in normal soils hydrogen sulfide is rendered harmless by precipitation as ferrous sulfide but in soils high in sulfate and organic matter and low in iron it may harm rice plants organic acids mainly acetic and butyric acids with small amounts of formic propionic and lactic acids and the organic reduction products produced in anaerobic soils harm rice plants nutrient transformations in submerged soils to increase the fertilizer efficiency in lowland rice it is imperative to understand the transformations of nutrient elements that occur in submerged soils submergence causes changes in the properties of the soil because of physical reactions between the soil and water and the biological and chemical processes set in motion as a result of excess water the most important change is the conversion of the root zone of the rice plant from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic or near anaerobic environment nitrogen transformations the special conditions prevailing in a flooded soil cause considerable modifica tion of nitrogen transformation processes fig 45 most of the transformations involve processes performed by microorganisms soil nitrogen occurs primarily in organic combination in the soil the breakdown of organic matter leading to the release of ammonium ions to the soil solution proceeds at a slower rate in a flooded soil than in a nonflooded soil the nitrogen supply for lowland rice comes largely from ammonium and nitrate nitrogen present when the soil is flooded nitrogen mineralized from soil organic matter and plant residue under nitrogen fixed by algae and heterotrophic bacteria nitrogen added as fertilizer organic nitrogen forms are a potential reserve of nitrogen for rice only after the organic form has been converted to the inorganic form flooded conditions nutrient transformations in submerged soils 101 figure 45 nitrogen transformations in submerged rice soils from savant and de datta 1980 unpublished lnorgonic nitrogen the inorganic nitrogen in the soil constitutes only a part of the total however it is from this fraction that plants derive the greater part of their nitrogen exchangeable ammonium most of the inorganic nitrogen present in reduced soils is water soluble or adsorbed on the exchange complex exchangeable ammonium nh 4 represents the form of nitrogen readily exchanged on the external surfaces of soil particles by suitable extractants for example 2 n kcl the inorganic nitrogen regime in flooded soils is essentially characterized by the accumulation of ammonia this occurs because the mineralization of organic 102 chemical changes in submerged rice soils nitrogen does not proceed beyond the ammonium stage in the absence of oxygen because oxygen is necessary for microbial conversion of ammonium to nitrate nitrite the nitrite form of nitrogen may accumulate under certain circum stances in aerobic alkaline soils and its production is attributed to the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by specific groups of microorganisms nitrosomonas and nitrococcus nitrite occurs in flooded soils as an intermediate in nitrification and denitrification the levels of nitrite in flooded soils including those fertilized with nitrate are generally in the 0 3 ppm range nitrate in submerged soils nitrate rapidly disappears presumably through denitrification leaching and plant uptake fixed ammonium fixed ammonium in soils has been described as that held within the lattice structures of silicate minerals it is neither water soluble nor readily exchanged from 14 to 78 of the total nitrogen in some tropical soils exists in this form nitrous oxide and elemental nitrogen nitrous oxide and elemental nitrogen can be formed in flooded soils nitrate under deficient oxygen levels replaces oxygen as the final electron acceptor in the respiration of many facultative anaerobes forming nitrous oxide and elemental nitrogen organic nitrogen although distribution of various nitrogenous organic compounds in flooded soils is not well documented it may not be very much different from that in normal well drained soils numerous forms of organic nitrogen are found in surface soils the methods used for fractionation of organic nitrogen in soils have been based largely on studies involving identification and estimation of the nitrogen compounds released by treatment of soils with mineral acids this is done by refluxing the soil with 6 n hcl following hydrolysis analysis of the hydrolyzate and residue has revealed the presence of compounds containing organic nitrogen amino acids hydrolysis of soils has shown that 2040 of the total nitrogen in most surface soils is in the form of amino acid n amino sugars about 510 of the soil nitrogen in most surface soils is represented by amino sugar nitrogen in the form of hexosamines purine and pyrimidine bases the evidence on the occurrence and amount of purine and pyrimidine derivatives indicates that these bases do not account for more than 1 of the surface soil nitrogen nutrient transformations in submerged soils 103 nitrogen mineralization in flooded soils fertilized rice obtains 5080 of its nitrogen requirement from the soil unfertilized rice obtains an even larger proportion mainly through mineraliza tion of organic sources thus rice depends primarily on the mineralization of organic sources for its nitrogen koyama 1975 broadbent 1979 the mineralization process includes hydrolysis of proteins to polypeptides and amino acids with subsequent deamination resulting in the formation of ammonia most of the complex variety of nitrogen containing compounds that may be present in the paddy soils are ultimately converted to ammonia however the breakdown of organic matter that leads to the liberation of ammonium ions into the solution phase proceeds at a much slower rate in a flooded soil than in a nonflooded soil research in japan indicates that several pretreatments have remarkable effects on the mineralization of native organic nitrogen in flooded soils these include airdrying the soil between the successive rice crops increasing the soil temperature in flooded soil raising the soil reaction to ph 90 by addition of weak alkaline solution mitsui 1955 broadbent 1979 listed soil temperature moisture level wetting and drying quantity of organic matter in the soil clay content organic amendments and others as important factors in mineralization of organic nitrogen quantities of nitrogen mineralized from organic sources during the growing period of a lowland rice crop are larger than for a similar period of an upland crop the greater part of the nitrogen mineralized during a season appears as ammonia within 2 weeks after submergence if the temperature is favorable and the soil is not strongly acid or very deficient in available phosphorus the amount of ammonia produced during the first 2 weeks of submergence may range from 50 to 350 ppm n on the basis of the dry soil the soil solution may contain 2 100 ppm n depending on texture and organic matter content of the soil pori namperuma 1972 rain the amount of nitrogen added to a soil by rainwater is small probably in the range of 5 14 kg ha losses of nitrogen nitrogen is removed from the soil by plant uptake but it is not considered a loss mechanism nitrogen losses in the soil occur mainly from denitrification 104 chemical changes in submerged rice soils ammonia volatilization leaching and surface runoff in addition immobiliza tion and ammonium fixation make nitrogen temporarily unavailable to the rice crop but do not cause loss of nitrogen from the soil system denitrification substantial losses of nitrogen from the soil have long prompted studies on denitrification in flooded rice soils in 1916 harrison and aiyar reported that 1095 of the total volume of gas evolved from flooded rice soils in india was nitrogen but only some of it came from denitrification the authors analyzed the gas escaping as bubbles from the surface of flooded indian rice soils in a study of the nature and extent of the change in gas composition caused by submergence besides nitrogen methane was also found although pearsall and mortimer 1939 were the first to report profile differentiation in the submerged soils of lake mud it was shioiri and mitsui 1935 and shioiri 1941 that gave details on the profile differentiation they observed considerable losses of nitrogen from applied ammonium sulfate as the period of incubation proceeded the profile differentiation of a flooded rice soil is in the surface layer corresponding to a few millimeters or a centimeter or so this layer is considered to be the oxidized zone where microorganisms live aerobically below that layer lies the reduced soil layer constituting the main part of the furrow slice where microorganisms live anaerobically pearsall and mortimer 1939 mitsui 1955 in the rhizosphere of the rice plant however the soil zone in close proximity to the rice roots is distinctly oxidized and therefore constitutes a condition similar to the surface layer some believe that part of the nitrogen present in a flooded soil is reduced to ammonia but others have found that little of the nitrate in a flooded soil reaches the ammonia form de and sarker 1936 broadbent and stojanovic 1952 in a flooded soil denitrification of applied nitrogen fertilizer can be substantial de and sarker 1936 reported losses of 3040 of the added inorganic fertilizer starting about 712 days after addition of no 3 n fertilizer the magnitude of loss of applied nitrogen has been estimated as 2040 in india 3050 in japan 37 in california and 68 in louisiana in the united states and 25 in the philippines in a study of nitrogen loss by using 15 nlabeled nitrogen patrick and tusneem 1972 differentiated profiles of oxidationreduction redox potential for the flooded soil exposed to the atmosphere figure 46 shows those profiles for samples incubated for 1 and 4 weeks oxygen penetrated only a short distance into the flooded soil before being reduced denitrification loss was very likely a result of the formation of a thick oxidized layer in which more ammonium nitrogen could be nitrified patrick and his associates 1972 1974 1976 1977 1978 studied extensively the mechanisms and kinetics of the nitrificationdenitrification process in controlled laboratory experiments without plants the highlights of their work are summarized in fig 47 figure 46 redox potential at ph 7 of flooded soil incubated 1 week left and 4 weeks right potential was measured with platinum electrode advancing downward through soil at rate of 2 mm hour a soil zone with redox potential greater than about 220 mv is considered to be aerobic and will support nitrification whereas a zone with redox potential below about 220 mv is considered to be anaerobic and will support denitrification from patrick and tusneem 1972 figure 47 nitrification denitrification reaction and kinetics of the related processes controlling nitrogen loss from aerobic anaerobic layer of a flooded soil system from patrick and reddy 1977 105 106 chemical changes in submerged rice soils the biological oxidation of nh 4 to no 3 k 318 g ncm 3 per day takes place in the surface aerobic layer this results in the development of a concentration gradient of nh 4 n across the aerobic layer and anaerobic layer and causes the nh 4 present in the anaerobic layer to diffuse d 0216 cm 2 day into the aerobic layer where it is nitrified the no 3 n formed diffuses back into the anaerobic layer d 133 cm 2 day where it is readily denitrified k 150 pg ncm 3 per day the slow rate of upward diffusion of nh 4 and also the slow rate of nitrification are probably the two limiting factors in nitrogen loss through the process of sequential nitrification denitrification in the flooded surface soil these studies were however conducted in experimental systems without any water movement natural field systems may be much more dynamic factors affecting denitrification various incubation and other studies to date envisage that many factors directly or indirectly influence the denitrifica tion process in the anaerobic surface soil layer those factors that affect the denitrification process are 1 soil factors ph and pe temperature organic matter nature and amount nitrate

presence of plants 2 other factors oxygen concentration experiments using labeled 15 n have shown that nitrogen loss from a flooded soil occurs when the flooded soil is exposed to oxygen nitrogen loss was generally related to the thickness of the aerobic layer even though appreciable loss occurred at 5 and 10 oxygen concentrations where the aerobic layer was relatively thin patrick and gotoh 1974 alternate drying and wetting severe nitrogen loss occurs in soils subjected to alternate draining aerobic and flooding anaerobic wijler and delwiche 1954 macrae et al 1968 nitrogen loss through sequential nitrification and denitrification is especially high in soils planted to lowland rice where water nutrient transformations in submerged soils 107 management practices in irrigated rice or irregular rainfall distribution in rainfed paddies cause frequent draining and reflooding reddy and patrick 1975 reported a greater nitrogen loss in a 2day aerobicanaerobic cycle than in longer cycles table 42 a subsequent study reddy and patrick 1976 indicated that besides nitrification during the aerobic period and denitrification during the anaerobic period no 2 n formation and chemical decomposition may also be involved in nitrogen loss especially for the more frequent changes in aerobic anaerobic condition ph and pe stanford et al 1975 found no correlation between the initial aerobic soil ph within the range from 5 to 8 and potential denitrification this is explainable on the basis of the kinetics of ph in submerged soils ponnam peruma 1972 the critical soil pe for ammonia reduction seems to be between 17 and 51 gotoh 1973 the stabilized ph 65 to 72 and pe 1 to 3 values of the lowland flooded soils are generally highly conducive to denitrification ponnamperuma 1972 1977 the soil microorganisms mediating denitrification seem to function best near ph 7 komatsu et al 1978 obtained data that indicate a possibility of participation of a fe 3 fe 2 system in denitrification in a flooded soil system soil temperature the denitrification rate in anaerobically incubated philip pine rice soils varied with soil type fig 48 and increased markedly as the temperature rose from 5 to 45c ponnamperuma 1977 level of nitrate present a few researchers have considered that the rate of denitrification is independent of the no 3 n concentration suggesting that it followed zeroorder reaction kinetics broadbent and clark 1965 patrick 1960 keeney 1973 others have reported denitrification following the firstorder reaction kinetics indicating its dependence on the no 3 concentration irri 1965 ponnamperuma 1972 bowman and focht 1974 stanford et al 1975 kohl et al 1976 reddy et al 1978 attempted to elucidate this phenomenon on the basis of the no 3 diffusion from the overlying floodwater layer to the soil layer they concluded that where nitrogen loss due to denitrification involves no 3 diffusion the denitrification appears to be a firstorder reaction rather than zero order in a watersediment system van kessell977 found that denitrification rate is dependent on no 3 concentration in the overlying water approximating firstorder reaction at lower concentration and gradually becoming independent of the no 3 concentration zeroorder reaction at higher no 3 content organic matter content of soil because denitrifying bacteria need organic matter as a source of carbon and nitrogen for their activity the nature and amount of organic matter in submerged lowland soils largely determine denitrification at a given temperature and nitrate concentration the

ponnamperuma 1977 highly and significantly correlated r 99 with their content of soluble or readily decomposable organic matter burford and bremner 1975 some of the recent studies of bremners group blackmer and bremner unpublished work cited by bremner 1977 indicate that the ratio of nitrogen oxide to nitrogen gas in the gases produced during denitrification is influenced by molecular weight and water solubility of organic substances added to the soil as expected the water soluble organic substances with low molecular weight have much greater effect on denitrification than high molecular weight substances with low water solubility in general loss of nitrogen through denitrification may not be a serious problem in tropical lowland rice fields such as those in india or burma primarily due to their low organic matter content kawaguchi and kyuma 1977 and eventually due to weak development of reducing conditions yamada 1975 earlier work of bremner and shaw 1958 indicated little or no gaseous loss of nitrogen from incubated waterlogged soils containing 1 organic carbon broadbent and stojanovic 1952 observed that the loss of nitrogen was greatest when a low oxygen content 01 was combined with a high level of organic matter 2 maize leaves activity of denitrifiers takai and uehara 1973 studied changes in bacterial flora in the surface and underlying layers of an incubated flooded soil system 110 chemical changes in submerged rice soils with progressing submergence time in the early stage of flooding the no 3 disappeared rapidly and was accompanied by a pronounced increase in denitrifiers there was no marked increase in nitrifiers in the aerobic layer at the middle stage as the oxidized layer developed a considerable increase in nitrifiers in the surface layers occurred the denitrifiers population was maintained at a high level and as a result no 3 n did not accumulate at the later stage the number of nitrifiers was sufficiently high but the number of denitrifiers dropped presumably due to a decrease in substrate concentration submergence period using 15 ntagged nh 4 n patrick and reddy 1976 observed that 15 nh 4 content of a flooded crowley silt loam decreased and a buildup of n 2 became evident after 15 days they noticed rapid conversion of nh 4 to n 2 after 30 days it is apparent therefore that nitrogen loss from the flooded soil due to the sequential nitrificationdenitrification would become significant only after 12 weeks of flooding this period is normally required for the differentiation of the discernible oxidized layer overlying the reduced layer ammonium diffusion experiments with 15 n have shown that more nh 4 n is lost from a flooded soil than is actually present in the aerobic soil layer at any one time tusneem and patrick 1971 apparently nh 4 n diffuses from the anaerobic soil layer to the aerobic soil layer where it undergoes nitrification and denitrification subse quent studies by reddy et al 1976 suggest that diffusion of nh 4 n from the anaerobic soil layer to the aerobic soil layer accounts for more than 50 of the total nh 4 n loss with the remainder lost from nh 4 n originally present in the aerobic layer ammonia volatilization ammonia a readily identifiable product of nitrogen mineralization is formed continuously in the soil and water of a flooded paddy the ready release of ammonia from organic matter decomposing in the absence of oxygen and the high ph associated with anaerobic decomposition favor ammonia volatilization from flooded soils that have had large amounts of organic matter added use of nitrogen fertilizers on rice also contributes large concentrations of dissolved nh 4 n salts ammoniumform fertilizers may dissociate directly or like urea may decompose by

aquatic biota was active free carbon dioxide declined in the system after 0600 hours reached a low point from 1200 to 1800 hours then increased until 2200 hours the percentage of mole fraction of carbonic acid decreased in proportion to the free carbon dioxide content of the water a similar effect was noted in the hco 3 and co 3 2 ion fraction fig 49 paddy water on acid luisiana clay typic

dioxide in the floodwater pertaining to an ammonium nitrogen source are apparent mikkelsen et al 1978 factors affecting ammonia loss by volatilization the volatilization of ammonia from a soil is a function of the various properties of the soil system involved including moisture content soil ph cation exchange capacity cec exchangeable cations texture lime content temperature and atmospheric conditions above the soil agronomic variables such as rates and sources of nitrogen fertilizers and time method and depth of application are also important moisture content the importance of water and rate of water loss from the soil in the ammonia volatilization process is emphasized by several workers however chao and kroontje 1964 showed that the rate of ammonia volatilization and of water evaporation from some soils follows different functions and is not related to soil water or the relative humidity of air flowing over a soil surface 112 chemical changes in submerged rice soils figure 49 changes in the ph and components of the carbonic acid system of rice floodwater 3 days after nitrogen fertilization on maahas clay irri 1976 wet season from mikkelsen et al 1978 soil ph it is recognized that soil ph may influence ammonia volatilization and that the higher the soil ph the higher the potential losses up to about ph 9 ammonia concentration increases by a factor of 10 per unit increase of ph cation exchange capacity the cec of the soil influences the degree of ammonia volatilization lehr and van wesemael 1961 the higher the cec the lower the ammonia volatilization losses for example in a 1979 study at irri nitrogen loss from urea fertilizer was shown to increase as the cec of the soil decreased at all cec values the percent nitrogen loss as ammonia from surface applied urea was higher than the broadcast and incorporated urea fig 410 the peak ammonia volatilization loss occurred between the first and second day when the nitrogen content in floodwater was also highest placement of urea supergranules in the san manuel sandy loam soil with low cec caused nitrogen loss of 65 the loss increased gradually with time from the day ofapplication in a coarse textured soil slow release nitrogen fertilizer is better than placement of supergranules for minimizing nitrogen losses as ammonia lime content lime content of the soil influences the ammonia volatilization losses some studies suggest that even in acid soil there could be a loss of nutrient transformations in submerged soils 113 figure 410 nh 3 volatilization loss from different forms of urea as affected by cation exchange capacity and texture of soil large drum experiment irri 1979 late dry season a supergranule placement at 1012cm depth gave negligible loss of nitrogen as nh 3 in silty clay clay

ammonium carbonate which decomposes to yield ammonia mikkelsen and de datta 1979 reported a 192 n loss through ammonia volatilization occurred when urea was applied either broadcast and incorporated basal or surface broadcast fig 411 although san manuel sandy loam soil is acidic the ph of the floodwater ranged from 80 to 90 with urea and ph 7785 with ammonium sulfate explaining the high ammonia losses in addition the cec of san manuel sandy loam soil was low 9 meq100 g soil which contributed to high ammonia losses temperature and atmospheric conditions the high temperatures and solar radiation that prevail in the dry season of tropical asia increase ammonia losses through volatilization dry season losses are also increased if the algal population in the floodwater becomes dense mikkelsen et al 1978 in the wet season however the amount of nitrogen applied to rice is low and the losses are lower because of relatively lower solar energy and lower temperature than in the dry season 114 chemical changes in submerged rice soils magnltude of ammonla volatlllzatlon losses in flooded soil am monia volatilization losses in flooded soils range from negligible to almost 60 of

neutral maahas clay and acid san manuel sandy loam in an outdoor drum experiment irri 1978 dry season from mikkelsen and de datta 1979 nutrient transformations in submerged soils 117 immobilization of nitrogen the microbial processes of nitrogen mineralization and immobilization occur simultaneously in soil mineralization replenishes the available nitrogen supply in soil and immobilization depletes or temporarily depletes it in any soil system there is a continuous interchange between inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen the immobilization assimilation of inorganic nitrogen by micro organisms is rapid during periods of active cell proliferation and slow when microbial activity is low the nitrogen requirements of the microorganisms in a flooded soil are generally lower than those of the microbial population of a nonflooded soil acharya 1935a b c for example in a california field study on the decomposi tion of rice straw in flooded soil williams et al 1968 concluded that the nitrogen requirement for the decomposition of rice straw was one third 05 vs 15 the average concentration of nitrogen required for aerobic decomposition of plant residue two reasons are cited for the low microbial population in flooded soils the anaerobic metabolism is inherently less efficient than aerobic metabo lism in providing energy for synthesis of new cells actinomycetes and fungi which convert from 15 to 40 of substrate carbon are inactive in submerged rice soils due to exclusion of oxygen broadbent 1978 broadbent summarized various studies reporting the critical nitrogen content of rice straw at which no net immobilization occurs when incorporated into flooded soil these ranged from 047 to 117 n in the rice straw depending on degree of maturity of the rice the apparent discrepancies are due to differences in the methods used to measure immobilization the factors that affect immobilization are water regime soil temperature kind and amount of organic matter rate of nitrogen applied and nitrification rate because ammonium is the preferred form of nitrogen for soil microorganisms more will be immobilized in a soil where ammonium persists than in one where it is quickly depleted information on the nitrogen immobilization process in flooded soils is meager and scattered studies at irri suggest that immobilization of nitrogen is about 20 of the nitrogen added for a philippine rice soil maahas clay that rate will vary among different soils yoshida and padre 1975 leaching of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen nitrate produced in the oxidized surface layer of a flooded soil moves easily by diffusion and percolation into the underlying reduced layer where it is rapidly denitrified 118 chemical changes in submerged rice soiis ammonium nitrogen is much less subject to leaching from the soil than nitrate because of its adsorption on the cation exchange complex losses of nitrogen by leaching occur mainly in coarse textured soils with low cec in soils where the primary source of negative charges is organic rather than inorganic the ammonium ion is also subject to leaching by percolation water harada and kutsuna 1955 some volcanic ash soils have low ammonium adsorbing power loss of ammonium by leaching is more severe in flooded soil than in nonflooded soil because ammonium is not as likely to accumulate in a well drained soil as in the flooded soil reduction reactions in a flooded soil produce ferrous and manganous ions which displace ammonium from the exchange complex to the soil solution where it is more subject to leaching the constant head of standing water in a flooded soil results in greater downward percolation of the soil solution than occurs in a nonflooded soil patrick and mahapatra 1968 ammonium fixation by clay minerals among the important transformation processes that involve ammoniacal nitrogen applied to the soil is that of ammonium fixation many researchers have observed that quantitative recovery of added ammonium could not be obtained in some soils even when soils were extracted immediately after addition of the ammonium early research suggested that ammonium retention was due to clay fixation subsequent studies revealed that some of the ammonium is fixed so tightly that it is resistant to extraction even after prolonged boiling with 6 n hcl recovery of tracer nitrogen was invariably less than that of total ammonium the well known ability of 21 type clay minerals to entrap fix ammonium ions between the silica sheets often accompanied by a contraction in the interlayer spacing has received limited attention in rice soils probably because fixation is often associated with drying to moisture contents below those usually encountered in lowland rice culture broadbent 1978 however there are some soils developed from volcanic ash in areas of high rainfall that have predomi nantly amorphous colloidal hydrated oxides of aluminum and iron and also allophane in some cases these soils also fix ammonium with regard to the magnitude of ammonium fixation in flooded soils reports are contradictory some investigators believe immobilization is less in flooded than in nonflooded soils others report more ammonium retention in flooded than in nonflooded soil shimpi and savant 1975 when ammonium and potassium ions were added to the soil at different concentrations and order of applications the two cations were fixed in nearly equivalent proportions but ammonium was fixed preferentially to potassium when both were added nommik 1965 according to nommik 1965 smectite nutrient transformations in submerged soils 119 does not fix ammonium under moist conditions nevertheless many soils maintained in the wet condition do fix some ammonium in a form that is slowly replaced by cations such as calcium magnesium and sodium but not by potassium from the above controversies broadbent 1978 concludes that the line of demarcation between exchangeable and fixed ammonium is somewhat super ficial and some of these discrepancies can be resolved if one realizes that plants and microorganisms are able to extract and use this so called fixed ammonium among the factors that affect ammonium retention or fixation by minerals and soils are ph moisture content clay mineral content nature of clay minerals organic matter and presence of cations such as potassium ions however in a recent study by sahrawat 1978 the ammonium fixation capacity of 12 soils was not correlated with ph organic matter or clay content but significantly correlated with active iron r 61 iron oxides in combination with organic matter and allophanic materials may cause ammonium fixation the ammonium fixing capacity of one philippine smectitic soil increased as the rate of ammonium application was increased but the percent recovery of ammonium remained more or less constant the availability of clay fixed ammonium to rice has not been evaluated adequately but preliminary experiments by manguiat 1976 suggest that defixation may occur more rapidly under flooding than has been reported in unsaturated soils allison et al 1953 in some soils ammonium fixation may be a factor in decreasing nitrogen loss by retarding the rate of nitrification the literature cited above suggests that ammonium can be fixed by both clay minerals and amorphous materials in soils and may be rendered unextractable by a rice crop even shortly after application the mechanism of fixation by these materials is different and not clearly understood research with isotopically labeled nitrogen is needed to assess the importance of ammonium fixation in both lowland and upland rice surface runoff information is limited on the quantity of nutrient losses by runoff from lowland rice fields takamura et al 1977 in japan made a balance sheet of nitrogen applied to rice fields and reported that 1316 of that applied was lost with surface drainage singh et al 1978 from studies in the philippines reported that more than 10 of the applied nitrogen was lost in surface runoff from lowland rice fields their results further indicated that in the wet season the total amount of water lost through surface drainage varied from 140 to 2040 mm with an average loss of 980 mm the net change in the nitrogen content of the water varied from a loss of 56 kg nha to a gain of 26 kg nha depending on fertilizer and water management practices most of the nitrogen outflow from rice fields was in the form of ammonium nitrogen with very little loss of nitrate nitrogen nitrogen losses by runoff in drainage can be substantially reduced by 120 chemical changes in submerged rice soils incorporating the nitrogen fertilizers and holding the irrigation or rainwater on the field for 5 days after fertilizer application accretion of nitrogen accretion of nitrogen takes place mainly by application of fertilizer and organic manure see chapter 10 from rain through urea hydrolysis and by biological nitrogen and rhizosphere nitrogen fixation urea hydrolysis urea is fast replacing ammonium sulfate as the most important nitrogen fertilizer for rice the rice plant can take up urea directly mitsui and kurihara 1962 but this mode of uptake is probably not important most of the urea nitrogen is taken up by the rice crop after urea is hydrolyzed to nh 4 2 co 3 the hydrolysis site is the soil rather than the floodwater the rate of urea hydrolysis has a profound effect on many transformation processes of nitrogen urea relative to ammonium is only weakly adsorbed by soil colloids therefore losses by leaching and runoff would be high if hydrolysis of urea is slow researchers such as delaune and patrick 1970 have shown that urea is hydrolyzed as rapidly in flooded as in nonflooded soils studies at irri found that urea hydrolysis is rapid in flooded tropical soils recently sahrawat 1978 reported that urease activity was highest in the alkaline maahas clay and lowest in an acid sulfate soil biological nitrogen fixation for centuries rice has been grown in tropical asia without significant inputs of chemical fertilizer but harvests have remained at 12 tha at irri 31 successive crops of rice were harvested from plots that had no fertilizer added and yield remained at 34 tha recently watanabe et al 1977 summarized data from japan thailand indonesia and the philippines and reported that a single rice crop can take from 37113 kg nha from sources other than mineral nitrogen fertilizer biological nitrogen fixation may partly explain the long term nitrogen fertility of flooded rice soils an indication of biological nitrogen fixation is clearly shown in the results of many long term fertility experiments carried out for several decades at japanese agricultural experiment stations yamaguchi 1979 rice yields did not decrease in most of the experiments in which no nitrogenous fertilizer was supplied and no significant decrease in soil nitrogen was recognized the principal agents

anoboenopsis and plectonema are abundant numerous trials mainly in india have shown 1545 kg nha per crop fixed by bluegreen algae in unfertilized rice fields extensive field trials in india indicate that about 30 of the cost of commercial nitrogen fertilizers could be reduced by algal supplementation work done at the indian agricultural research institute new delhi and elsewhere suggests that in areas where commercial fertilizers are not used algal application can provide as much as 30 kg n ha per crop in the presence of fertilizers the benefits are complementary venkatraman 1977 application

fixation by blue green algae azolla and rhizosphere bacteria should be clearly understood before their practical significance is appreciated the relative ease of establishing azolla however makes it somewhat attractive for certain tropical rice culture systems in asia transformation of soil phosphorus in flooded soils the transformation processes of phosphorus in flooded soils are greatly different from those in nonflooded soils the processes also differ for different water regimes the understanding of these transformation processes is important for phosphorus fertilization of rice which grows in water regimes ranging from continuous flooding to alternate flooding and drying availability and fixation of phosphorus are two opposing chemical reactions that largely determine the phosphorus status in soils availability of phosphorus the phosphorus supplying capacity of flooded rice soils is higher than that of nonflooded soils flooded rice frequently does not show response to phosphorus addition even though crops show a large response when grown on the same soil when it is dry the availability of phosphorus is closely related to the degree of soil reduction in a taiwan soil chiang 1963 the contents of available phosphorus and iron 124 chemical changes in submerged rice soils increased proportionately with the decrease in eh however the increase in available phosphorus and iron is not so closely related to the increase in ph the main reactions involved in this change of availability are reduction of insoluble ferric phosphate fepo 4 2h 2 o to more soluble hydrolysis of aluminum and iron phosphate at the higher soil ph that occurs the dissolution of the apatite because of the higher co 2 pressure in the soil desorption of phosphorus from clay and oxides of aluminum and iron the other mechanisms of phosphorus release in a flooded soil postulated by various researchers and summarized by patrick and mahapatra 1968 include release of occluded phosphate by reduction of hydrated ferric oxide coating displacement of phosphate from ferric and aluminum phosphate by organic ferrous phosphate fe 3 po 4 2 8h 2 o after submergence solution anions among these reactions the reduction of ferric phosphate to ferrous phosphate appears to be dominant chang 1965 by directly measuring the quantity of phosphorus absorbed from each chemical form of inorganic phosphorus demonstrated that iron phosphate is the main source of phosphorus absorbed by rice under submergence in acidic and calcareous soils shapiro 1958 reported that an increase in available phosphorus by flooding as measured by a values of phosphorus available soil phosphorus in relation to applied phosphorus fertilizer is considerable in an acid soil rich in iron phosphate but there is no increase in a calcareous soil and muck organic soil low in iron phosphate table 45 he concluded that the increase in the availability of soil phosphorus with submergence is mainly due to reduction rather than hydrolysis from the above studies it can be concluded that calcium phosphate is not an important source of available phosphorus either in acidic soils low in calcium phosphates or in calcareous soils the above findings can be explained on the basis of specific surface activity calcium phosphate is more concentrated in the fraction of coarser soil particles sand and silt and thus has smaller specific surface activity iron and aluminum phosphates are more concentrated in the finer fraction clay and thus have greater surface activity it is believed that phosphates existing in a more dispersed state such as iron phosphates are more available to plants irrespective of their chemical form chang 1976 with submergence crystallized iron phosphate tends to change into colloidal iron phosphate through solution precipitation juo and ellis 1968 found that colloidal iron phosphate has a larger surface area than its crystallized counterpart and therefore the availability of the former is greater it appears that the increase in availability of iron phosphate is partly due to the nutrient transformations in submerged soils 125 table 45 effects of flooding on the availability

crystalline form to the more easily soluble colloidal form changes in the availability of iron phosphate in soils as influenced by submergence and drying can be postulated as follows chang 1971 different reactions of soil phosphorus in flooded and nonflooded soils have been attributed to the association of the phosphate ion with the ferrous iron instead of ferric iron that is usually associated with nonflooded soils mitsui 1955 subsequently davide 1960 reported that with cah 4 po 4 2 as a phosphorus source response of rice was almost the same in flooded and nonflooded soils but with iron phosphate rice showed much better response on flooded soils than on nonflooded soils he concluded that the beneficial effects of flooding on phosphorus availability depend on the intensity of reduction and the iron content of the soil 126 chemical changes in submerged rice soils in another study with five flooded soils increased phosphorus availability after flooding was apparently due to the hydrolysis of alpo 4 and the reduction of fepo 4 after prolonged periods of flooding phosphorus becomes less available probably due to higher fixation patrick and mahapatra 1968 islam and elahi 1954 demonstrated the reversion of ferric to ferrous iron under flooding for laboratory incubation there was a progressive reduction of fe 3 to fe 2 and an increase in readily soluble phosphate in a lateritic soil the addition of oxidizable materials such as green manure increased the soil reduction process and thereby increased the phosphorus availability of soil among the various fractions reductant soluble phosphate is of special significance in flooded soils this fraction consists of phosphate occluded in hydrated ferric oxide that is unavailable in nonflooded soils patrick and mahapatra 1968 using an acid soil from louisiana united states suggested fep as the most dominant form under flooding fig 414 with alternate wetting and drying which is the case in most rainfed rice growing areas and in some irrigated areas in the asian tropics the percentage of phosphate in the aluminum form decreases and the percentage in the iron form increases drying a soil subsequent to flooding generally decreases the solubility of both soil and added phosphorus and increases phosphorus fixing capacity thus decreasing the solubility of phosphorus phosphorus fixation the phosphorus fixing capacity of soils is considered an important soil parameter for recommendation of adequate levels of phosphorus for the desired fertilizer response although the mobility of phosphorus in flooded soils may be greater than that in nonflooded soil the soluble phosphorus applied to flooded soils is fixed on the surface of the solid phase of the soil chang 1976 lin et al 1973 analyzed the phosphorus content of soil samples obtained from plots in a long term fertility figure 414 transformation of inorganic phosphorus in a soil as a result of waterlogging from patrick and mahapatra 1968 nutrient transformations in submerged soils 127 experiment 48 years of application of phosphorus and found that 58 of the applied phosphorus was retained in the surface soil and subsoil the relative amounts of phosphorus fixed by aluminum iron or calcium depend on the exposed reactive surface area of the respective cations of the solid phase and the concentration of these cations in the soil solution with time both aluminum and calcium phosphates transform to iron phosphate the rate of transformation increases in the presence of water therefore it is reasonable to infer that the aluminum and calcium phosphates on the surface are readily transformed into iron phosphate thus in a flooded soil the available phosphorus is probably stored as surface iron phosphate chang 1976 studies at irri indicate that phosphorus fixation in flooded rice soils is rapid in acid and neutral soils the amount of added phosphorus remaining in solution 32 plabeled superphosphate is lowest within 4 days of equilibration in acid ultisols and slightly higher in alfisols the fixation of phosphorus is consider ably slower in slightly alkaline soils de datta et al 1966 soils containing hydrated iron and aluminum oxides halloysites and allophanes fix phosphorus in both upland and lowland soils kinetics of water soluble phosphorus the increase in concentration of water soluble phosphorus after soil sub mergence is appreciable and is markedly affected by soil properties fig 415 the increases in concentration of water soluble phosphorus after flooding are highest in sandy calcareous soil low in iron moderate in acid sandy soil low in iron small in the nearly neutral clay and least in the acid ferralitic clay ponnamperuma 1972 this phenomenon could possibly result from a secon dary reaction between the dissolved phosphorus and the iron compound patrick and khalid 1974 found that anaerobic soils release more phosphorus into soil solutions low in phosphorus and sorb more phosphorus from solutions high in phosphorus than do aerobic soils they attributed this phenomenon to the greater surface area of the gellike colloidal ferrous compounds in a flooded soil following soil reduction transformation of potassium in flooded soils the effect of flooding on the chemistry and availability of soil potassium has not been studied adequately potassium is present in soils in four forms which are in dynamic equilibrium as follows su 1976 soluble k exchangeable k nonexchangeable k mineral k semi instantly d easily mobilizable d slowly mobilizable permanent available k reserve of available k stock of available k reserve 128 chemical changes in submerged rice soils figure 415 kinetics of water soluble phosphorus in five submerged soils from ponnamperuma 1976 potassium is absorbed by plants after it has been transported to the root surface in a submerged soil in situ convective transport of potassium may play a major role whereas diffusive transport plays a minor one increasing soluble potassium and leaching with flooding soluble ferrous ions and manganous ions increase and exchange able potassium is then displaced into the soil solution the increase in soluble potassium after flooding is closely related to the ferrous ion content of the soil solution in the field with adequate drainage leaching of soil potassium may be nutrient transfonations in submerged soils 129 considerable studies in taiwan summarized by chang 1971 suggest that losses of potassium by leaching could be substantial if the displaced potassium cations and other basic ions are lost by leaching or by diffusion to the surface and loss in surface runoff soils become acid when oxidized brinkman 1970 fixation and release of fixed potassium the mechanism governing potassium fixation and release is not clearly understood but it is generally known to be affected by the nature of soil colloids wetting and drying freezing and thawing and the presence of lime only about 12 of the total amount of potassium in an average mineral soil is readily available and exists as potassium in the soil solution or as exchangeable potassium sorbed on the soil colloids under certain soil conditions added potassium is fixed by soil colloids and is not readily available to the rice plant the nonexchangeable form is in dynamic equilibrium with the available forms and therefore acts as an important reservoir of slowly available potassium clays of the 21 type vermiculite hydrous mica and beidellite can fix potassium readily and in large amounts mclean 1978 studies in taiwan indicate that the fixation of applied potassium is low in latosols more in a slightly acidic sandstone and shale alluvial soil and high in calcareous and shale mudstone soils chang and feng 19581959 it was also known in taiwan that rice plants can absorb a larger percentage of the total absorbed potassium from the nonexchangeable form under flooding than they can under nonflooded conditions vigorous growth of rice in a flooded soil probably increases extraction of potassium from the soil chang 1971 suggested that under flooding with continuous removal of soluble and exchangeable potassium the release of fixed potassium is favored the correlation of the response of rice to h 2 so 4 extractable potassium from several soils was better than with exchangeable potassium suggesting exchange able potassium may not be entirely indicative of the available potassium status due to the rapid release of nonexchangeable potassium from the soil an intensityquantity relationship has been used for studying potassium availability to plants grown in an unsaturated soil moisture regime upland conditions however such soils differ considerably from submerged rice soils the ionic composition of the reduced soil solution is dominated by fe 2 and mn 2 ion species this situation poses a problem in application of the intensity quantity relationships for potassium to flooded rice soils potassium dynamics of

first 5 min at 50 v and the next 5 min at 200 v and the total euf k fractions sum of all potassium fractions obtained after 35 min of eufthe first 5 min at 50 v the next 25 min at 200 v and the last 5 min at 400 v the euf k fraction i represents the potassium concentration in the soil solution intensity factor whereas the total euf k fractions represent the total amount of the effectively available potassium quantity factor these euf k parameters particularly the total euf k fractions have been closely related to the grain yields and have been better indicators of potassium availability than the exchangeable potassium technique fig 416 however the eufk fraction i clearly underestimated the potassium availability in a maligaya silty clay loam and overestimated it in a pili clay this was because the figure 416 relationship between total euf k fractions a euf k fraction 1 b or exchangeable k c and absolute grain yields of ir26 1977 dry season at the bicol and maligaya stations in the philippines the soil samples were taken from the np and npk plots after harvest of the 1977 dry season crop residual fertilizer potassium has accumulated on the potassium treated plots as a result of the long term potassium application since 1968 which amounted to 60 and 90 kg k 2 oha per season two crops per year nutrient transformations in submerged soils 131 figure 417 relationship between exchangeable potassium quantity and eufk fraction i intensity for pili clay and maligaya silty clay loam in the philippines the potassium buffer capacity is indicated by the slope of the regression line of exchangeable potassium on the eufk fraction i potassium availability in soils is controlled not only by the soil solution potassium but also by its buffering by the soil particles which was distinctly different for the two soils studied fig 417 the soil solution potassium intensity i is maintained by the exchangeable potassium quantity q in a dynamic equilibrium the higher dqdi or the higher potassium buffer capacity in the maligaya silty clay loam than in the pili clay indicates that during the active growing season the potassium concentration in the soil solution will be depleted faster in the piliclay than in the maligaya silty clay loam this explains the higher optimum potassium concentration in the soil solution in the pili clay than in the maligaya silty clay loam fig 4166 the optimum potassium concentration in the soil solution can thus be lower if the potassium buffer capacity of the soil is higher the difference in the potassium buffer capacities of both tested soils was due mainly to the differences in the clay mineralogy the vermiculite bound exchangeable potassium in the maligaya silty clay loam is more strongly bound than the entirely smectite bound exchangeable potassium in the pili clay regardless of the differences in the clay mineralogy the total euf k fractions made a satisfactory assessment of the potassium availability in both soils and correlated closely with the grain yield fig 416a maximum grain yields were 132 chemical changes in submerged rice soils obtained when the total euf k fractions after harvest prior to wetland preparation were above 30 ppm the euf results suggest that potassium dynamics of lowland rice soils can be evaluated better by the euf technique than the conventional method of exchangeable potassium wanasuria et al 1980 antagonistic action between potassium and iron an excessive concentration of ferrous iron in the soil solution will under certain conditions combine with the potassium salts in the soil to form sparingly soluble double salts consisting of k 2 so 4 feso 4 and h 2 o in various proportions and thus decrease the availability of potassium it is also possible that excessive absorption of iron may retard the absorption of potassium this probably explains a physiological disorder of rice in a poorly drained soil in northeastern taiwan that can be corrected by application of potassium fertilizer chang 1971 reactions of zinc in flooded rice soils mikkelsen and kuo 1977 developed a simplified diagram illustrating dynamic equilibria of zinc fig 418 it shows that rice receives zinc from the soil solution and the exchangeable and adsorbed solid phase including the soil organic fraction unlike the redox elements iron and manganese the concentrations of zinc in soil solution generally decrease after flooding although zinc may undergo a temporary increase immediately after flooding irri 1971 mikkelsen and kuo 1976 1977 the zinc levels equilibrate around 03 05 m forno et al 1975 although no definite explanation can be offered patrick and reddy 1977 suggested that the decreased zinc concentration may be due to precipitation of zn oh 2 as a result of increased ph after flooding precipitation of znco 3 due to co 2 accumulation resulting from organic precipitation of zns under very reduced soil conditions the mobility of zinc is affected by ph absorption clay and organic matter other soil parameters such as percentage of clay and organic matter and calcium and phosphorus status are also associated with total soil zinc a wide variety of chemical reactions in soils undoubtedly influence the availability of zinc to rice for example high manganese concentrations antagonize zinc absorption and translocation calcium and magnesium may also affect zinc uptake but to a lesser extent giordano et al 1974 showed the order of interference of zinc absorption and translocation to be matter decomposition nutrient transformations in submerged soils 133 figure 418 dynamic equilibria of soil zinc and plant uptake from mikkelsen and kuo 1977 depression of zinc uptake fe cu mg mn ca depression of zinc translocation fe cu ca mn another factor that may influence the chemistry of zinc in flooded soils is phosphorus although considerable research has been done to determine how cations and anions affect zinc in plants the mechanism involved in these reactions remains highly speculative although the effect of flooding on the chemistry of zinc in soil and on plant absorption is not yet clear some soil constituents have been implicated mikkelsen and kuo 1977 the reversible ph change oxidation reduction and carbon dioxide partial pressures may play an important role in regulating zinc uptake by rice the reversible ph change of the flooded soil where the ph tends to increase in acid soil and decrease in alkaline soils undoubtedly alters the zinc equilibrium concentration in the soil solution because the solubility of zinc minerals and zinc sorbed by soil colloidals is phdependent higher at higher ph an increase in the ph of an acid soil when flooded will tend to decrease the zinc concentration in the solution therefore the uptake of zinc by rice will decrease in the alkaline soil however zinc uptake increases as the ph decreases after submergence the reversible ph change could partially explain why zinc uptake was lower in acid or higher in alkaline soil after flooding mikkelsen and kuo 1977 134 chemical changes in submerged rice soils zinc deficiency is aggravated by addition of organic matter yoshida and tanaka 1969 reported that normal rice plants became zinc deficient with the addition of 05 of cellulose to the soil the cellulose additions enhance soil reduction and carbon dioxide accumulation as a result of anaerobic decom position of organic matter irri 1971 experiments of forno et al 1975 and mikkelsen and brandon 1972 also showed that addition of readily decompos able organic materials may aggravate zinc deficiency and reduce zinc uptake by rice plants the role of organic matter can therefore be related to the soil reduction and accumulation of carbon dioxide the formation of insoluble sphalerite zns has been considered a factor controlling zinc availability for rice irri 1971 with the release of carbon dioxide when organic materials decompose carbonate and bicarbonate ions in the soil and floodwater increase the amounts of carbonate and bicarbonate ions present are a function of partial pressure of carbon dioxide ph of the solution and ionic strength of the soil solution flooded soils especially alkaline or calcareous soils possess all the essential characteristics for the formation of high levels of bicarbonate ions there is a strong coincidence between high carbon dioxide partial pressures and the appearance of zinc deficiency in alkaline soils the rate of zinc absorption by rice roots is about twice that of wheat which explains greater depletion of zinc in the vicinity of rice roots and creation of a concentration gradient in which rice becomes zinc deficient faster than wheat however some rices are relatively more tolerant of zinc deficiency than others factors affecting zinc availability to rice in addition to the physical and chemical reactions in soils various crop management factors combine to influence the availability of zinc to rice among the most important are the native zinc content of the soil soil ph organic matter flooding carbon dioxide partial pressure p co 2 bicarbonate ions organic acids various natural interactions environmental effects water quality the soil factors affecting zinc availability to rice are shown in fig 419 these factors are discussed in detail by mikkelsen and kuo 1977 nutrient transfomations in submerged soils 135 figure 419 factors affecting zinc availability to rice adapted from mikkelsen and kuo 1977 transformation of sulfur in flooded soils the main transformations of sulfur in flooded soils are the reduction of sulfate to sulfide and conversion of organic sulfur to hydrogen sulfide the hydrogen sulfide formed may react with heavy metal ions in soil such as fe 2 zn 2 and cu 2 to give insoluble sulfides as a result the availability of these metal elements may be reduced because fe 3 reduction to fe 2 precedes so 4 reduction there usually will be fe 2 present in the soil solution by the time hydrogen sulfide is produced so that hydrogen sulfide will be converted to insoluble fes this reaction protects microorganisms and higher plants from toxic effects of hydrogen sulfide in muck soils and sandy soils low in iron 2 136 chemical changes in submerged rice soils however where iron is inactivated by the complex formation with organic matter fes formation may not take place as a result hydrogen sulfide toxicity to the rice plant is possible the kinetics of water soluble sulfate which is a measure of sulfate reduction in flooded soils depends on soil properties in neutral and alkaline soils concentrations as high as 1500 ppm so 4 2 may be reduced to zero within 6 weeks after flooding acid soils first show an increase in water soluble so 4 2 then a slow decrease spread over several months the initial increase in so 4 2 concentration is due to the release following increase in ph of so 4 2 which is strongly sorbed at low ph by clay and hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum sulfate reduction proceeds slowly in flooded acid sulfate soils despite their strong acidity lime accelerates the reduction considerably ponnamperuma 1972 rice like other plants absorbs sulfur primarily in the form of sulfate and the reduction of sulfate to sulfide in submerged soils reduces the availability of sulfur however rice takes up sulfur which is oxidized as so 4 2 on the root surface engler and patrick 1975 the reduction of sulfate in flooded soils has three implications for rice culture the sulfur supply may become insufficient zinc and copper may be immobilized and hydrogen sulfide toxicity may arise in soils low in iron ponnamperuma 1972 transformation of silicon in flooded soils silicon occurs in soils as crystalline and amorphous silica as silicates as silicon absorbed or coprecipitated with hydrous oxides of al 3 fe 3 and mn 4 and as silicon dissolved in soil solution the dominant silicon form in soil solution of flooded soils is sioh 4 which is in equilibrium with quartz sio 2 silica concentration in a silica water system is independent of ph over most of the ph range 28 iler 1979 patrick and reddy 1978 obtained similar results for flooded soils the concentration of silicon in the solutions of flooded soils increases slightly after flooding and then decreases gradually after several months of sub mergence the silicon concentration may be lower than at the start ponnam peruma 1972 the increase is probably due to the release of adsorbed and occluded silica from hydroxides of iron and aluminum mckeague and cline 1963 further the concentration of silicon in the soil solution increases with soil reduction apparently because of the reduction of feiii oxide hydrates that sorb silicon ponnamperuma 1965 1978 ponnamperuma 1965 showed the increase in solubility of sio 2 with time of submergence and indicated marked differences among soils in soluble sio 2 content before and after flooding soils with a high content of organic matter regardless of ph gave the highest increases decomposing rice straw with its high silicon content may also contribute to the increased silicon content of the soil solution in flooded soils patrick and reddy 1978 chemical kinetics and soil fertility 137 factors affecting the silicon content in the soil the concentration of sioh 4 in equilibrium with amorphous silica at 25 c is 120140 ppm as si02 and is independent of ph in the 2 9 range the concentrations of silicon in natural waters are much less than 120 ppm and in solutions decrease with increase in ph up to about ph 8 jones and handreck 1967 the low concentrations of silicon in natural waters have been attributed to the sorption of silicon by hydrous oxides of feiii and al and to recombination of silicon with aluminum silicates the solubility of silicic acid in the soil solution is sometimes directly related to the availability of the soil phosphorus to plants elawad and green 1979 transformations of copper boron and molybdenum in flooded soils very little is known of the transformation processes involved withcopper boron and molybdenum in flooded soils in a recent summary patrick and reddy 1977 suggest that the chemistry of copper in flooded soils may be similar to zinc boron concentration seems to remain more or less constant after submergence of rice soil molybdenum concentration in rice soils was found to increase after sub mergence ponnamperuma 1975 possibly due to increased ph chemical kinetics and soil fertility flooding brings about drastic changes in a soil affecting many chemical and biochemical processes that affect the availability and loss of nutrients the rates and magnitudes of these changes vary widely among soils they are higher in soil low in nitrate and manganese dioxide or high in organic matter ponnamperuma 1965 availability of nutrients soil properties duration of submergence and temperature strongly influence the concentration of water soluble no 3 exchangeable and water soluble nh 4 total and water soluble fe 2 and mn 2 water soluble k ca 2 mg 2 so 4 2 water soluble cu zn and mo carbon dioxide and organic acids ponnamperuma 1977 138 chemical changes in submerged rice soils small amounts of nitrate may be present in the soil surface and the supernatant water at the time of flooding and throughout submergence nitrate is easily absorbed by rice and nitrate disappearance through denitrification or leaching represents the loss of a valuable nutrient the period of intensive reduction production of ammonia buildup of high concentration of co 2 fe 2 mn 2 and organic reduction products occurs in the first 2 6 weeks after flooding also during this period the availability of phosphorus silicon and potassium increases markedly this means that the duration of submergence of a soil prior to planting is an important variable in the productivity of flooded soils references acharya c n 1935a studies on the anaerobic decomposition of plant materials i the acharya c n 1935b

growth and development of the rice plant 5 the most comprehensive among early studies of the morphology of the rice plant was that of juliano and aldama 1937 other reports of interest are those of kuwada 1910 santos 1933 and morinaga and fukushima 1934 a widely adopted description of the plant morphology and varietal characteristics is by chang and bardenas 1965 structure of the rice grain the rice fruit is a caryopsis in which the single seed is fused with the wall pericarp of the ripened ovary forming a seedlike grain the caryopsis is enveloped by the lemma and palea fig 51 among cultivars the rice caryopsis varies widely in shape and in size the mature rice seed is harvested as a covered grain rough rice in which the caryopsis is enclosed anatomy of the rice grain the main components of the rice grain are the hull caryopsis coat endosperm and embryo figure 51 details the composition of each component hull the rice caryopsis is surrounded by a hull husk composed of two modified leaves the palea and a larger lemma the palea and lemma are held together by hooklike structures bechtel and pomeranz 1978 the cells of the mature hull are highly lignified and brittle with high concentrations of silica in the hull cells presumably in the outer epidermal cells 146 structure of the rice grain 147 figure 51 structure of the rice grain adapted from juliano and aldarna 1937 juliano 1980 caryopsis coat surrounding the endosperm of mature rice caryopsis but inside the hull are three distinct layers that make up the caryopsis coatthe pericarp seed coat and nucellus the seed coat is beneath the pericarp abutting the seedcoat cuticle is another thick cuticle of the crushed nucellar cells endosperm the endosperm consists of an aleurone layer which forms the outermost layer of endosperm tissue the number of aleurone layers present is dependent on location in the grain 148 morphology growth and development of the rice plant variety and environmental factors the aleurone layer is rich in phosphorus magnesium and potassium tanaka et al 1974 a starchy endosperm which consists of thin walled parenchyma cells usually radially elongated and heavily loaded with compound starch granules and some protein bodies juliano 1972 juliano and bechtel 1980 divided starchy endosperm into a subaleurone located just beneath the aleurone and a central region consisting of the rest of the starch endosperm embryo the embryo or germ is extremely small and is located on the ventral side of the caryopsis it contains the embryonic leaves plumule and embryonic primary root radicle which are joined by a very short stem mesocotyl the plumule is enclosed by a cylinderlike protective covering the coleoptile and the radicle is ensheathed by a mass of soft tissue the coleorhiza the outer side of theembryo is enclosed by the aleurone layer the coleoptile is surrounded by the scutellum and the epiblast the vascular trace of coleoptile is fused with lateral parts of the scutellum juliano 1972 morphology of the rice plant cultivated rice is an annual grass with round jointed culms rather flat leaves and terminal panicles vegetative organs the vegetative organs consist of roots culms and leaves a branch of the plant bearing the root culm leaves and often a panicle is called a tiller roots the rice plant has a fibrous root system there are two kinds of roots seminal roots that grow out of the radicle and are temporary in nature secondary adventitious roots that are freely branched and produced from the lower nodes of the young culm these roots replace the seminal roots culms the culm or stem is made up of nodes and internodes in alternate order the node bears a leaf and a bud which may grow into a tiller or shoot the mature morphology of the rice plant 149 internode is hollow and finely grooved at an early growth stage what is often referred to as the culm is composed mostly of leaf sheaths and is not the true culm which is very short at that stage tillers grow out of the main culm in an alternate order the primary tillers grow from the lowermost nodes and give rise to secondary tillers these in turn give rise to a third group called tertiary tillers fig 52 figure 52 parts of a primary tiller and its secondary tiller adapted from chang and bardenas 1965 150 morphology growth and development of the rice plant leaves the leaves are borne at an angle on the culm in two ranks one at each node the blade or the expanded part of the leaf is attached to the node by the leaf sheath the leaf sheath is the lower part of the leaf originating from the node and enclosing the internode above it and sometimes the leaf sheaths and blades of the succeeding internodes the flag leaf is the uppermost leaf below the panicle the auricles are on either side of the base of the blade in pairs of small and the ligule is a papery triangular structure just above the auricles earlike appendages fig 52 floral organs the floral organs of the rice plant are modified shoots consisting of a panicle and spikelets panicle the panicle is a determinate inflorescence on the terminal shoot fig 53 the extent to which the panicle and a portion of the uppermost internode extend beyond the flag leaf sheath determines the exsertion of the panicle varieties differ in degree of exsertion and environment can modify the extent of exsertion spikelets a spikelet is the unit of the panicle and consists of two sterile lemmas the rachilla and the floret fig 54 the rachilla is the small axis between the rudimentary glumes the sterile lemmas and the fertile floret the floret includes the lemma palea and the enclosed flower the lemma is the hardened fivenerved bract of the floret partly enclosing the palea it bears an awn a filiform extension at different lengths from the keel middle nerve of the lemma the palea is a hardened threenerved bract of the floret and fits closely to the lemma it is similar to the lemma but narrower the flower consists of six stamens and a pistil with the perianth represented by the lodicules the six stamens are composed of twocelled anthers borne on slender filaments the pistil contains one ovule figure 53 component parts of a panicle partly shown in this illustration adapted from chang and bardenas 1965 151 152 morphology growth and development of the rice plant figure 54 parts of a spikelet from chang and bardenas 1965 grain the grain is the ripened ovary with the lemma palea rachilla sterile lemmas and the awn if present firmly adhered to it the dehulled rice grain caryopsis with a brownish pericarp is called brown rice dehulled rice grain with a red pericarp is red rice germination growth and development of the rice plant the development of the rice plant may be divided into three phases the vegetative phase which runs from germination to panicle initiation the reproductive stage which runs from panicle initiation to flowering a ripening phase which runs from flowering to full maturity these main phases however may be further divided into physiologically distinct stages or periods figure 55 shows the detailed divisions of the main phases of the rice crop with different durations germination growth and development of the rice plant 153 figure 55 in shortduration photoperiod insensitive varieties 105120 days maximum tiller number panicle initiation and internode elongation occur almost simultaneously in long duration varieties 150 days there is a so called lag vegetative period during which maximum tillering stem elongation and panicle initiation occur in succession vegetative stage of crop development germination of seed rice seeds germinate by pushing the radicle through the coleorhiza the coleoptile that encloses the young leaves emerges as a tapered cylinder the coleoptile later ruptures at the apex and the primary leaf emerges figure 56 shows parts of young seedlings germinated under light and darkness in warm moist conditions the grains of nondormant varieties can germinate immediately after ripening in dormant varieties a period of time depending upon the variety must elapse before germination can occur a heat treatment 50c for 45 days mechanical dehulling or chemicals such as hno 3 can be 154 morphology growth and development of the rice plant germinated under light germinated in darkness showing the mesocotyl figure 56 parts of young seedlings adapted from chang and bardenas 1965 used to break the dormancy of freshly harvested seeds many tropical rice varieties have a period of dormancy which prevents the panicles from germinating when in contact with water particularly when the crop is lodged during the ripening stage when a rice grain germinates in an aerated environment such as a well drained soil the sheath coleorhiza enveloping the radicle in the embryo protrudes fig 56 before the coleoptile if it germinates in water the cylinderlike structure coleoptile emerges ahead of the coleorhiza the radicle breaks through the coleorhiza shortly after the latter appears this is followed by the formation of two or more seminal roots all of which develop lateral branches germination growth and development of the rice plant 155 emergence and growth of seedlings in the tropics the first leaf usually emerges 3 days after sowing pregerminated seeds pregermination is usually accomplished by soaking for 24 hours and incubating for 48 hours the seedling stage includes the period from emergence until just before the appearance of the first tiller during this stage the seedling develops seminal roots and absorbs most of the endosperm by the 10th day two more leaves should be fully developed leaves continue to develop at the rate of one every 34 figure 57 stages from germination emergence of the first leaf up to full grown 18 dayold seedlings ready for transplanting 156 morphology growth and development of the rice plant days during the early stages adventitious roots that form the fibrous root system rapidly replace the temporary seminal roots dissected seedlings show six leaves three fully developed two developing and one dead leaves are numbered according to the order in which they appear figure 57 shows germination emergence of seedlings and the full grown 18dayold seedlings the tillering stage follows the seedling stage and starts with the appearance of the first tiller from the axillary bud in one of the lowermost nodes tillers displace a leaf as they grow and develop after emergence of primary tillers large arrow in fig 58a they begin to form secondary tillers small arrow this happens at about 30 days of age with ir36 an earlymaturing 105 days from seed to maturity photoperiodinsensitive semidwarf variety at that stage the plant rapidly increases in length and tillers actively fig 58b besides the primary and secondary tillers new tertiary tillers start to appear as the plant becomes taller and larger the growth of tertiary tillers is in two stages maximum tillering stage the increase of tertiary tillers continues up to a certain point designated as the maximum tiller number stage at this stage tillers have increased in number to the point that it is difficult to pick out the main culm after the maximumtillernumber stage some tillers die and the number of tillers declines and levels off fig 55 the plants stop producing secondary tillers after the tertiary tillers third group of tillers are produced stem elongation stage this stage begins before panicle initiation in long growthduration varieties and it usually occurs during the later part of the figure 58 stages of crop growth showing a emergence of primary tillers large arrow through beginningtoform secondary tillers small arrow b increase in plant height and tiller number germination growth and development of the rice plant 157 tillering stage in short growth duration varieties stem elongation and panicle development occur simultaneously reproductive stage of crop development the reproductive stage begins just before or just after the maximum tillering stage depending on variety and environment the reproductive stage is marked by the initiation of a panicle primordium of microscopic dimensions in the growing shoot panicle initiation the panicle initiation stage begins when the primordium of the panicle has differentiated and becomes visible in a shortduration variety 105 days from seed to maturity the panicle primordium starts to differentiate at about 40 days after seeding and becomes visible 11 days later visual panicle initiation as a white feathery cone 1015 mm in length fig 59 panicle initiation occurs first in the main culm and follows in the tillers in an uneven pattern in long duration varieties 135160 days the basal internodes have elongated considerably as much as 1 m before panicle initiation if water is figure 59 the primordia of panicles have differentiated and become visible 158 morphology growth and development of the rice plant limiting panicle initiation may be delayed this often occurs in rice direct seeded in a nonpuddled soil panicle development during the panicle development stage the spikelets become distinguishable and the panicle extends upward inside the flag leaf sheath the panicle continues to develop slowly when it has grown to a length of 5 cm about 7 days after panicle becomes visible in a dissected specimen the spikelet primordia differentiate and the number of spikelets is determined during this first part of the reproductive stage yield is adversely affected by any stress exerted on the plant booting booting is the latter part of the panicle development stage about 16 days after visual panicle initiation the sheath of the flag leaf swells this swelling of the flag leaf sheath is called booting senescence of leaves and unproductive nonpanicle bearing tillers become noticeable at the base of the plant when the collar of the flag leaf and that of the preceding leaf are at the same level as shown in the center of fig 510 meiosis is occurring in the spikelets located at the midregion of the growing panicle heading the booting stage is followed by the emergence of the panicle heading out of the flag leaf sheath flowering anthesis blooming or flowering begins with protrusions of the first dehiscing anthers in the terminal spikelets at the time anthesis is occurring the panicle is erect in shape the panicles flower beginning at the top middle and lower thirds occurring in the lst 2nd and 3rd day after panicle exsertion heading in a tropical environment fernandez et al 1979 flowering occurs about 25 days after visual panicle initiation regardless of variety flowering continues successively until most spikelets in the panicle have bloomed pollination and fertilization rice is highly self pollinated the florets open from 0900 to 1500 dependent on variety and weather they open early on bright days and late on humid and cloudy days the stamens elongate and the anthers move out of the flowering glumes as pollen is shed the pollen grains fall on the pistil a feathery structure through which the pollen tube of the germinating grains will extend into the ovary fig 511 the lemma and palea then close ripening stages of crop development the rice grain develops after pollination and fertilization grain development is a continuous process and the grain undergoes distinct changes before it fully figure 510 meiosis in the spikelets takes place when the collar of the flag leaf and that of the prcceding leaf are at the same level as shown in the center figure 511 at the time of anthesis the panicle is erect and the following developments take place a the florets of a rachis open in the morning in most cultivars b the stamens elongate and the anthers move out of the flowering glumes as pollen is shed the florets then close c the pollen on the pistil seen here as a feathery structure through which the pollen tube will extend into the ovary 159 160 morphology growth and development of the rice plant figure 512 development of the rice grain after flowering through the various stages to the mature grain matures in the tropics the ripening stage from flowering to maturity takes 2535 days regardless of variety in temperate countries such as japan southern australia and the united states ripening takes 4560 days ripening involves three stages in the milk grains rage the contents of the caryopsis the starch portion of the grain are first watery but later turn milky in consistency when held upright the top of the panicle during the milk stage will bend gently in an arc the content of the grain is a white liquid that can be squeezed out in the dough grain stage the milky portion of the grain turns first into a soft and later a hard dough in the mature grain stage grain color in the panicles begins to change from green to yellow the individual grain is mature fully developed and is hard and free from green tint the mature grain stage is complete when 90100 of the filled spikelets have turned yellow the panicle arches further with the exception of a few still green spikelets and all grains are yellow and hard at this time senescence of the upper leaves including the flag leaves is noticeable in some varieties the culm and upper leaves may remain green even when the grains have ripened figure 512 shows the development of the rice grain after flowering development stages of the rice plant the growth and development stages of the rice plant differ under different climatic and cultural conditions based on experience in texas stansel 1975 developed simplified time ranges for each development stage of the rice plant fig 513 the time ranges presented are for the very early and earlymaturing germination growth and development of the rice piant 161 figure 513 development stages of the rice plant from stansel 1975 35 days under warm conditions use the lower number of days and for cool conditions use the larger number of days the reproductive stage begins with panicle differentiation which can be seen only by splitting the stem lengthwise at this stage 30 of the main culms sampled have a panicle 2 mm orlonger stage iii begins when 50 ofthe florets are pollinated variable time025 days dependent upon variety photoperiod insensitive varieties although the time ranges represent a warm or cool weather combination for the texas rice belt the basic time ranges should be applicable in areas with a similar environmental regime recently zadoks et al 1974 proposed a decimal code for the growth stages of cereals that may be applicable to rice with some modifications 162 morphology growth and development of the rice plant plant age and leaf development the development stage of the rice plant can be determined by the number of leaves it bears the leaves develop consecutively and live for a short period from germination to heading the numbered leaves developing from the main culm are generally less in number for a short duration variety than a long duration variety figure 514 leaves in the rice plant develop consecutively and live for a short period in earlymaturing ir36 the first leaf is bladeless and is considered leaf zero this leaf dies in 1012 days at flowering five to six leaves are still active and during grain ripening only two or three remain active the leaves are named as the first second third leaf and so on in the order they emerge and the number of fully developed leaves on the main culm is an indication of the physiological growth stage of a given variety using early maturing ir36 fernandez et al 1979 determined the relative time of full emergence and life duration of 14 leaf blades throughout the stages of the rice plant fig 514 in ir36 the first leaf which is bladeless and is considered leaf zero dies in 1012 days the other leaves last 2535 days except the last two leaves which may last longer at flowering five or six leaves remain active during grain ripening only two or three leaves remain active tillering capacity and leaf area index effect on yield 163 synchronization in leaf development during vegetative plant growth there is a close relationship between the appearance of each tiller and the emergence of leaves on the main culm for example simultaneously with the appearance of the fourth leaf 40 from the main culm the first leaf of primary tiller no 1 11 emerges simultaneously with the appearance of the fifth leaf sixth leaf 50 60 on the main culm the second leaf third leaf 21 31 emerges from primary tiller no 1 leaves represented by 21 31 and 50 60 are called the synchronously emerged leaves matsubayashi et al 1963 reported that each of the respective leaves both on the main culm and tillers develops at a definite interval and that all the leaves from tillers develop in parallel with the development of leaves on the main culm tlllerlng capacity and leaf area index effect on yield in monsoonal asia high tillering rices are very desirable for transplanted or direct seeded rice cultivars with improved plant type and high tillering capacity can be planted at a wide range of spacings and still produce an adequate number of tillers per unit area the tiller number is positively or negatively correlated with grain yield depending on the rice cultivar and crop environment kawano and tanaka 1968 it is well established that nitrogen application markedly increases the tillering of rices fig 515 the total leaf area of a rice population is a factor closely related to grain production because the total leaf area at flowering greatly affects the amount of photosynthates available to the panicle it is known that 7580 of the carbohydrates in the grain are photosynthesized after flowering ishizuka and tanaka 1953 welbank et al 1968 and yoshida and ahn 1968 in the tropics yoshida and parao 1976 showed a close correlation between grain yield and leaf area index lai at heading fig 516 similar results were obtained with ir8 in northern australia basinski and airey 1970 later studies suggest that except for peta a lodging susceptible variety grain yields of all other rices in the dry season increaseas the plant density and lai values increase fig 517 peta lodged heavily and the yields were low at most plant densities and at most lai values high plant densities and nitrogen levels increased the spikelet number and lai value of ir8 fig 518 but with increased spikelet number and a high lai filled spikelet percentage decreased particularly during the wet season murata 1969 reported high lai values as desirable for increasing spikelet number an important component of physical capacity for grain yield an important barrier to raising grain yields at high lai values is the resulting decrease in filled spikelet percentage to increase yields beyond currently attainable levels cultivars must be found that have a higher percentage of filled figure 515 effects of nitrogen level on the tillering capacity of rice cultivars at flowering 100 100 cm spacing irri 1969 dry and wet seasons from fagade

short and small erect short and stiff upright compact high tillering low sterility or high ripening percentage at high nitrogen rates high graintostraw ratio high harvest index associated with more erect habit higher photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area associated with more erect habit even distribution of leaves in a canopy increases sunlit leaf sur face area thereby permitting more even distribution of incident light prevents lodging permits greater penetration of incident light into canopy adapted to a wide range of spacings capable of compen sating for missing hills permits faster leaf area development transplanted rice permits use of larger amounts of nitrogen associated with high yields spikelets at higher spikelet number and lai values if such cultivars are found broadcast seeding will raise grain yields still further because broadcastseeded plants produce high spikelet numbers more readily than the transplanted ones for broadcast seeding the varieties must have better lodging resistance than ir8 however fagade and de datta 1971 table 51 summarizes certain varietal characters probably related to the high yield potential of rice varieties three major characters are considered important for obtaining high yields short and stiff culms erect leaves high tillering capacity growth patterns in rice 167 short and stiff culms make the rice plant more resistant to lodging a major advance was made in the mid1960s when a semidwarf gene was effectively introduced into tropical rice varieties a close association between erect leaves and high yield potential has been shown in the past there is a need for real understanding of the physical meaning of erect leaves in terms of light use by a plant community yoshida et al 1 972 have discussed it in relation to plant response the usefulness of erect leaves is more pronounced at high light intensities than at low light intensities in rice the upper three leaves export their assimilation products to the grains during the ripening period thus erect leaves which increase exposure of leaf surface to sunlight must be important in increasing yield in transplanted rice limited leafarea development due to wide spacing may reduce grain yield for such conditions high and earlytillering varieties have a definite advantage further high tillering capacity gives the plant greater ability to compensate for missing hills that may be caused by poor stand establishment insects and diseases in fact hayashi 1969 found that many highyielding varieties in japan are short erectleaved and high tillering similar results have been reported from many studies in the tropics yoshida et al 1972 in temperate countries such as australia and the united states where direct seeding is the only method used to plant rice high tillering capacity of rice varieties is not essential in fact many farmers in australia get 89 tha yield with one or two tillers per plant however panicle density often exceeds 700m 2 in china also where transplanting is a major planting method high tillering capacity of rice is not considered essential low tillering capacity is compensated by higher number of seedlings per hill these results suggest that the most important factor is to get high panicle or spikelet number or both per unit area this should be attainable partly through breeding and partly through improved management practices growth patterns in rice in the diverse climatic environment in which rice is grown the patterns of growth also vary growth has two aspects dry matter production quantitative change phasal development qualitative change during the developmental stage figure 519 shows an example of growth process described by tanaka et al 1964 phasal development is the sequential development of the threegrowth phases the condition of the plant during the vegetative phases determines the tiller number which is also the potential number of panicles it also determines the 168 morphology growth and development of the rice plant figure 519 example of growth process of tropical rice peta in the rainy season at irri from tanaka 1976 condition of leaves that function during the reproductive phase the plants condition during the reproductive phase determines the number and size of spikelets and also the status of the leaves that contribute to ripening tanaka 1976 grain production which is the final product of growth and development is controlled by dry matter production during the ripening phase the dry matter production in turn is controlled by two factors the potential ability of the population to photosynthesize the source the capacity of spikelets to accept the photosynthates the sink tanaka 1972 the sink is composed of the panicle number per unit field area determined during vegetative stage rice growth in different environments 169 figure 520 diagram illustrating three types of phasal development pi panicle primordia initiation stage f flowering stage h harvest adapted

determined during reproductive stage tanaka et al 1964 classified three types of growth patterns from the standpoint of phasal development fig 520 the types vary according to the combinations of varieties environmental conditions and cultural practices details on these growth patterns are described by tanaka 1976 stages rice growth in different environments although selection of varieties is made by considering the environmental condition in which the crop is going to be grown the growth patterns vary considerably long duration varieties of rice may be considered a necessity under certain rainfall or photoperiod regimes in the low latitude areas in the high latitude 170 morphology growth and development of the rice plant areas because of a limited length of season with suitable temperature regime longduration varieties cannot be grown in the high latitude areas vegetative growth is slow and long whereas in low latitude areas it is vigorous and short because of this the possibility is greater for a medium duration variety to assume type b patterns in the high latitude areas and type c patterns in low latitude areas fig 520 for a long time the type c growth pattern was common in the tropics therefore despite high total dry matter production the grain yields were low due to low harvest index however with the introduction of modern varieties in the tropics rice follows the type a fig 520 growth pattern that maintains a high growth rate throughout growth due to a favorable plant type and produces high lai and high grain yield growth duration in relation to yield in temperate asia the growth duration of rice can be manipulated in a limited way by manipulating cultural practices for example in japan where rice is mostly machine transplanted seedbed technology has been considerably improved farmers in japan extend the rice season by the use of temperature protected seedbeds this led to use of longer duration varieties and to significant yield increase ishizuka et al 1973 rice yields in japan have increased steadily due to improvements in variety and cultural practices the rice growing season has been shifted to earlier in the spring by using nonseasonal varieties transplanting is done when the temperature is lower in the tropics where temperature is favorable for year round rice culture there appears to be an optimum growth duration for high grain yields for example the growth period of short duration plants of less than 100 day figure 521 relationship between growth duration and grain yield the spacing used was 25 30 cm and the nitrogen level was 40 kg ha irri 1963 from vergara 1970 references 171 maturity grown under normal field conditions usually does not permit the production of sufficient leaf area to result in production of larger number of panicles with well filled spikelets results of tests by vergara 1970 indicate that under certain environmental conditions 14 n the best yields are from varieties that mature in 130140 days fig 521 optimum growth duration could be attained earlier by closer spacing or higher nitrogen levels with increased emphasis on increased cropping intensity in both irrigated and rainfed areas there is a considerable demand for rices with growth duration around 100 days with the use of those shorterduration varieties it is possible to raise the productivity per hectare per day even if the individual crop yield is somewhat lower than for varieties with 130 days or longer thus growth manipulation should be designed to efficiently use given resources such as water

oryza sativa l and the planting of the african cultigen o glaberrima steud taxonomy origin and early cultivation the genus oryza belongs to the tribe oryzeae in the family gramineae about 20 valid species are distributed chiefly in the humid tropics of africa south and southeast asia southern china south and central america and australia chang 1976 cultivated rice belongs to the genus oryza and its most important species is o sativa oryza glaberrima grown sporadically in some west african countries is gradually being replaced by o sativa among many botanists who studied oryza roschevicz 1931 was the first one to postulate that the center of origin of section sativa rosch to which o sativa l and o glaberrima steud belong was in africa sampath 1962 and oka 1964 considered that o perennis moench was the common progenitor of both the asian and african cultivated rice porteres 1956 suggested that the common progenitor was a rhizomatous and floating form but no mention of name was made oryza nivara sharma et shastry an annual wild form from central india sharma and shastry 1965 appears to be the immediate progenitor of the asian cultivated rice o sativa three ecogeographic races of o sativa are recognized indica japonica and javanica fig 61 indica rices are indigenous to the humid regions of the asian tropics and subtropics the japonicas are limited to temperate zones and subtropics the temperate race was differentiated in china and therefore japonicas are also known as sinicas or keng chang 1964 1976 javanicas are mainly grown in parts of indonesia cultivation of rice in many humid parts of tropical and subtropical asia probably began about 10000 years ago india may have had the earliest date of cultivation because wild rices were abundant there the domestication process first took place in china cultural practices for domestication such as puddling and transplanting were first developed in north and central china and later transmitted to southeast asia

1976 china but in many hilly areas of southeast asia upland rice cultivation preceded lowland planting methods progressed from shifting cultivation to direct sowing in permanent fields then to transplanting in bunded fields chang 1976 domestication of rice in asia may have occurred independently and at about the same time in many places along a broad belt extending from the ganges plains below the eastern foothills of the himalayas across northern burma northern thailand laos and vietnam to southwest and south china chang 1964 1976 there were likely several routes by which the asian rices were introduced into other parts of the world south asia was undoubtedly the main source of indica varieties later found in ancient persia and various parts of africa the japonica type spread from china to korea and japan europeans could have obtained rices through ancient persia central asia or directly from china latin american countries obtained rices largely from spain and portugal the early rices in the united states came from the malagasy republic europe and the far east details on the dispersal of the rice cultivars have been summarized by lu and chang 1980 the introduction of o sativa in africa was primarily through visitors from malayo polynesia a few centuries b c another possible route of introduction was from sri lanka and indonesia via oman and then on to somalia zanzibar and kilua carpenter 1978 oryza glaberrima is indigenous to tropical west africa and probably originated there about 1500 b c porteres 1956 oryza glaberrima evolved from the wild annual rice usually named either o breviligulata chev et roehr or o barthii a chev porteres 1956 carpenter 1978 rice varietal improvement 175 rice varietal improvement since the dawn of agriculture rice in tropical asia has been primarily a monsoonal crop grown from june to december in the tropics north of the equator and from november to april south of the equator in parts of south india and sri lanka the main crop is grown during the northeast monsoon during september to february earlier varieties grown during the monsoon had a long maturity period 160200 days and a limited number of varieties grown in the off season in sri lanka eastern india bangladesh philippines west malaysia and indonesia had a shorter maturity period 90130 days most of the latter varieties for example the aus and boro varieties of northeastern india and bangladesh and the kuruvai and kars of south india had little sensitivity to photoperiod changes thus length of growing season was an important varietal specification most varietal collections were limited to varieties grown in the lowlands of the monsoonal tropics parthasarathy 1972 early breeding work in tropical asia rice breeding at the beginning of the century was based on selection among farmers varieties which had been selected for local adaptation and preferred grain quality for many centuries the selection was limited to purification by removal of off types in the varieties popular with farmers the next step was mass selection in such varieties following that cross fertilization for combining specific traits in different varieties was attempted introductions from neigh boring countries and regions played an important role through direct use by farmers and effective utilization by breeders in hybridization programs early rice breeding in tropical asia was done at a single experiment station without testing of varieties in widely different environments workers in indonesia notably h siregar were probably the first group who made selections from common hybrid materials at the central experiment station at bogor and each of the six regional stations in java that led to the evolution of varieties adapted to the whole of java and its different soil types and climates in india rice breeding work was initiated in 1911 in east bengal now bangladesh in 1929 the imperial now indian council of agricultural research icar aided breeding work in various states a detailed account of rice breeding work in india is given by ghosh et al 1960 the breeding objectives of india primarily included development of varieties with different growth duration yielding ability grain quality tolerance for flooding salinity drought and resistance to lodging and blast parthasarathy 1972 intensive selection from local populations in different parts of india led to the identification of several varieties that served as the foundation of a modern breeding program for developing varieties with high and stable yields and resistance to major diseases and insects examples of those varieties selected 176 varietal development of rice through continuous exposure to plant stress caused by climatic edaphic and biologic conditions are

breeding objectives included yield particular grain types and milling quality sri lanka is divided into dry and humid regions according to the amount of rainfall received only indica rices were used in breeding varieties highly responsive to fertilizer the cross between murungakayan 302 and mas from indonesia gave rise to h4 red rice and h5 white rice h5 was considered fertilizerresponsive and resistant to blast the early varieties grown in indonesia belonged to the two groups the tjereh indica and the bulu or javanica on the islands of bali and lambok where rice culture was highly specialized bulus are still grown bulus are also grown on the mountain terraces in banaue philippines and in the mountain areas of taiwan chang 1976 the bulus as a group are distinguished from japonicas and indicas by low tillering tall plants stiff straw long panicles long awns large and bold nonshattering grains and low sensitivity to photoperiod thailand specialized early in growing varieties with highquality long slender grains these varieties still form the bulk of thailands exported rice the strict demands of the export trade for highquality grain naturally imposed some restrictions on achieving other objectives in breeding in the central plain and northeast thailand nonglutinous varieties of the grain type mentioned earlier were grown during the late 1950s an intensive breeding program for blast resistance was initiated also five floating varieties needed for the north the northeast and the central plain were released early breeding work in temperate regions in japan rough rice yield has increased from 37 tha in 1916 to 50 tha in 1966 institute of developing economies 1969 in 1927 a rice breeding effort was organized to develop rice varieties suitable to 12 ecological conditions during the last 60 years rice breeders in japan have placed major emphasis on breeding for high yield with heavy fertilizer application blast resistance resistance

grain quality okabe 1972 from 1927 to about 1949 the konosu experiment station was responsible for making crosses followed by f 2 selections for distribution to regional breeding stations today the breeding network consists of many small breeding stations in different environments in 1962 12 ecological regions were consolidated into four macro ecological districts a cold weather district hokkaido a cool weather district northern parts of honshu a warm weather district southwestern honshu and a hot weather district kyushu shikoku and sato inland sea coastal areas since 1962 new breeding objectives in japan included suitable plant characters for direct seeding early maturity and wide adaptability in the united states cooperative rice breeding studies were initiated in 1909 with the establishment of louisianas crowley station rice breeding research in the united states from 1909 to 1961 are covered by jones 1936 and adair et al 1973 in 1931 the united states department of agriculture initiated coordinated rice breeding programs with state agricultural experiment stations in louisiana texas california and arkansas there was continuous attention to develop ment of varieties with a reasonably wide maturity range within each grain type short medium and long grains johnston et al 1972 some examples of varieties developed during the early years include colusa short grain in 1917 zenith medium grain in 1936 and rexoro long grain in 1928 century patna 231 developed in 1951 was an early maturing long grain variety with moderate height that was adapted to high fertilizer application and combine harvesting in 1970 only about 88 of the rice growing area in the united states grew short grain varieties such as caloro and colusa about 415 was sown to medium grain varieties such as arkrose calrose cs m3 nato nova 66 saturn and zenith the remaining area was sown to long grain varities such as belle patna bluebelle bluebonnet 50 dawn della rexoro starbonnet toro and tp 49 descriptions of these varieties are given by adair et al 1973 evolution of the ponlai rices during the early period of the japanese occupation of taiwan which began in 1894 several japanese introductions were extensively tested but none was outstanding in performance huang et al 1972 at a may 1926 japan rice production conference in taipei the japanese varieties planted in taiwan were named ponlai rice meaning heavenly rice and synonymous with horai in japanese after 1926 varietal work emphasized blast resistance from 1931 to 1943 crosses in taiwan led to new ponlai varieties with grain qualities equal to and yielding abilities superior to the varieties introduced from japan taichung 65 was the most prominent pre world war ii variety that could be profitably grown in both the first and second crop seasons it yielded well on a wide range of soil types these improved ponlai varieties were also early maturing which provided opportunity to practice multiple cropping in taiwan the photoperiod 178 varietal development of rice and temperature insensitive ponlai rices also produced record yields in west africa and india chang 1967 shastry 1966 indica japonica hybridization program the concept of indica japonica hybridization with its more clearly defined objectives and systematic planning represents a transition from early to modern rice breeding in the united states indica japonica crosses led to a number of commercial varieties during the late 1930s and early 1940s as a sequel to the recommendations of the international rice commission irc working party an indica japonica hybridization program was initiated in 1951 under the auspices of food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations this project represented the first international effort toward multicountry cooperative breeding in rice the fao project also focused for the first time on use of the genetic potential of the rice plant to capitalize on added fertilizers under tropical conditions all the countries of tropical asia participated in the project by sending the seeds of their best indica varieties for crossing with japonicas at the central rice research institute crri cuttack india which was selected as the center for making the crosses and the growing of the f 1 plants f 2 seeds from the crosses were dispatched to participating countries for further selection work simultaneously icar funded a similar program for the different states of india only india and malaysia distributed early maturing nonseasonal commercial varieties derived from the project in india adt 27 which was suitable for the early monsoonal season replaced the earlier varieties adt 3 and adt 4 in the tanjore delta in malaysia malinja and mashuri had the preferred grain quality and were found adapted to the second crop season in the irrigated areas in wellesley province parthasarathy 1972 even today mashuri is widely grown in many parts of tropical asia where there is poor soil and poor water control in the monsoonal season lack of dormancy and susceptibility to blast however limit mashuris yield improving the plant type rice breeders have continually worked to develop high yielding varieties of rice that respond to high rates of nitrogen fertilizer baba 1954 nagai 1958 reported in countries like japan where high yield is aimed at by intensive culture with heavy application of fertilizers the leading varieties are required to possess heavy tillering ability with short culm and resistance to lodging the relationship between morphological characteristics and grain yield has received considerable attention since the pioneering work of tsunoda 1962 the introduction of semidwarf genes into rice and wheat varieties in the early 1960s increased spectacularly the yielding ability of these crops largely because of increased resistance to lodging the relationship of improved plant type to rice varietal improvement 179 yielding ability is described by beachell and jennings 1965 and mcdonald 1978 irri began its operations with the important breeding objectives of development of high yielding short sturdy strawed rice varieties that would resist lodging even with high rates of fertilizer application beachell and jennings 1965 beachell et al 1972 in 1969 beachell and khush summarized the traits that were objectives of irris breeding work as nitrogen responsiveness resistance to diseases resistance to insects photoperiod insensitivity grain dormancy high milling yield superior cooking and eating quality slow leaf senescence and tolerance for cold weather some of the traits are essential for all improved rice others are essential in a certain country or in a given region of a country for example high nitrogen responsiveness should be desirable everywhere other traits such as early vegetative vigor and relatively high tillering capacity to be competitive with weeds are essential in the rainfed transplanted rice culture but not essential under direct seeding with irrigation also grain dormancy resistance to leaf damage during typhoons slow leaf senescence and ability to withstand drought and flood are essential in some regions in the tropics but not essential in temperate regions such as in australia the united states or japan development of high yielding semidwarf rice varieties the following are examples of modern semidwarf varieties that revolutionized rice culture in tropical subtropical and temperate asia semidwarfism as used here refers to a reduction in plant height controlled primarily by a single major recessive gene taichung native 1 one of the significant events in the history of varietal improvement of rice was the development of a high yielding semidwarf indica variety taichung native 1 it resulted from the cross of dee geowoogen and tsai yuanchung made in 1949 by breeders at the taichung district agricultural improvement station taiwan the precise origin of the semidwarf dee geowoogen is not known although it was grown by taiwanese farmers prior to 1951 huang 1956 taichung native 1 was selected and named in 1956 but its official seed multiplication and distribution began in 1960 huang et al 1972 outside taiwan the value of taichung native 1 and some ponlai varieties was not fully recognized until after the mid 1960s chang 1967 guang chang ai breeders at chinas academy of agricultural sciences in guangdong province crossed ai zaizan with guang chang 13 in 1956 to develop the semidwarf guang chang ai in 1961 it was released for general use irri 1978a guang

guangdong province a semidwarf plant was selected from a field of nante 16 during 1956 the selection was named aijionante and introduced into neighboring provinces it attained a planted area of 733000 ha during 1965 in areas south of the yangtze river shen 1980 guanghwaiai the semidwarf varieties were widely accepted and by 1965 most of the first crop in guangdong province was planted to them at about the same time 1963 a dwarf variety kuangerai was released for the second crop of the tworicecrop system it was further crossed with a locally adapted secondcrop variety and an improved variety guanghwaiai was released for the second crop it has narrow leaves and is photoperiodsensitive irri 1978a ir8 in 1962 among 38 crosses made at irri the most successful was the 8th cross which involved peta a tall and heavytillering diseaseresistant indica variety of indonesia and deegeowoogen the semidwarf chinese variety ir82883 was one of the promising lines identified in the f 4 generation of the cross in march 1965 ir82883 was first planted in the yield nursery and produced a computed yield of 66 t ha chandler 1969 in the 1966 dry season at irri it showed outstanding fertilizer nitrogen

yield is still between 15 and 20 tha yields are 50 tha or more in temperate rice growing countries such as japan republic of korea united states australia spain and italy much of the yield difference is because rice in the tropics is grown under widely different agroclimates and under adverse growing condi tions furthermore the more numerous and more diverse insects and diseases cause more severe damage to the rice crop in the tropics than in temperate regions breeding programs in the tropics current breeding programs for the tropics and temperate regions must consider issues such as grain quality and resistance to or tolerance for the diverse environmental regimes rice is exposed to genetic evaluation and utilization geu program in 1973 irri initiated a genetic evaluation and utilization geu program based on interdisciplinary and problem oriented rice breeding brady 1975 plant breeders were teamed with problem area scientists such as plant patholo gists entomologists cereal chemists soil scientists plant physiologists and agronomists each team member contributes specialized knowledge to the joint effort to identify screen and cross diverse rices the geu goal is incorporation of the best characteristics into nutritious rice varieties that resisted or tolerated environmental and biological enemies of the rice plant fig 64 major geu problem areas include agronomic characteristics grain quality resistance to diseases resistance to insects high nutrient levels including protein tolerance for drought tolerance for adverse soils tolerance for deep water tolerance for temperature extremes an integral part of the geu program is linkage with national rice improvement programs in rice producing countries particularly in asia the four interrelated components of the geu program are current breeding programs 183 figure 64 the building of modern rice varieties disease and insect resistance and superior agronomic characteristics are the core for

sources of genes for various traits part of this collection was from the state of assam and was later called the assam rice collection in the peoples republic of china 30000 local varieties were assembled in the late 1950s and many of the varieties were used for varietal improvement shen 1980 an early phase of the rice improvement program in the united states benefited from a sizeable

indonesia kampuchea phil ippines sri lanka and vietnam workers in seven other countries added 29700 samples to the collection chang 1980 recognizing the serious implications of the rapid disappearance of genetic resources in the diverse rice germ plasm the international board for genetic resources and irri cosponsored the 1977 rice genetic conservation work shop participants from 18 countries agreed on monitoring of field collection efforts and the need to promote international and institutional collaboration on the collection characterization and conservation of rice genetic resources irri 1978b figure 65 shows different operations at irri relating to collection and utilization of germ plasm irris rice genetic resources laboratory opened in 1977 in its long term storage facilities seed samples are stored invacuum sealed cans at 10 c and should remain viable for at least 50 years perhaps 100 years in the medium term storage a 4c temperature is maintained and seed samples should

research research progress to serve rice growers in problem areas has been steady and significant since the geu concept was formalized in 1973 the geu concept is gradually being adopted in national programs in asia agronomic characteristics increasing the yield potential of rice by developing rices with desirable plant type is the major objective of all breeding programs for irrigated areas the semidwarf plant type exemplified by ir8 with short stature about 100 cm sturdy stem high tillering ability lodging current breeding programs 185 figure 65 irri operations in acquiring increasing seed cataloging preserving evaluating and utilizing rice germ plasm with the collaboration of other agricultural research centers from chang 1980 resistance and dark green erect leaves still represents the most efficient combination of plant characters essential to high fertilizer responsiveness and high grain yields in many rainfed lowland areas varieties with intermediate plant stature about 120 cm are more popular than the shorter statured varieties rices intermediate or moderately tall also appear more desirable for upland conditions chang et al 1972 consequently intermediate stature and moderate tillering ability are being introduced into lines with erect leaves and sturdy stems that are known to be resistant to the major insects and diseases khush and coffman 1977 with increased emphasis on crop intensification came a growing demand for early maturing rices 90100 days from seed to maturity for irrigated and rainfed areas several early maturing varieties have been released ir28 and ir30 in 1975 ir36 in 1976 and ir50 in 1979 by the government of the philippines br7 in 1977 by bangladesh and ratna in 1970 palman 579 in 1972 and pusa 221 in 1975 by india all mature in 105110 days grain quality next to yield grain quality is the most important factor considered by plant breeders if consumers do not accept the taste texture 186 varietal development of rice aroma or appearance of a newly developed variety its usefulness is greatly impaired in the developed countries and in the riceexporting countries physical appearance of the grain is often more important than grain yield in the developing countries grain quality takes greater importance as the countries become more prosperous and selfsufficient in rice grain size and shape milling recovery of head rice absence of white belly appropriate amylose content gelatinization temperature gel consistency and aroma are important factors in the development of a successful rice variety grain appearance is largely determined by endosperm opacity the amount of chalkiness either on the dorsal side of the grain white belly or in the center white center and the condition of the eye or pit left in the embryo when the grain is milled rice samples with damaged eyes have poor appearance and low market acceptability similarly the greater the chalkiness the lower the market value cooking and eating qualities are largely determined by the properties of the starch which makes up 90 of milled rice several tests are conducted in standard laboratories to determine the cooking characteristics of rice varieties these characteristics are gelatinization temperature amylose content gel consistency grain elongation and aroma details on these characteristics are given by juliano 1979 highgrainquality rice has different meaning in different countries depend ing on consumer preference or preference in the international market in thailand good quality rice is defined as that with a long slender translucent grain that produces a fluffy tender cooked product kongseree 1979 a cursory examination of the old recommended varieties reveals that most have slender clear grain with a length of more than 7 mm many varieties have moderately high amylose content the popularity of khao dawk mali 105 a lowamylose rice in thailand may be more the result of its aroma than its amylose content although association between long grain and slender shape chalkiness and bold shape grain dormancy and late maturity and high protein and light grains has been detected in several instances no serious barrier in obtaining various combinations of desirable traits in a breeding program is envisaged chang and somrith 1979 the ultimate test of a rice variety is in the market place where consumers generally decide on the basis of physical appearance it is important to translate the physicochemical properties and eating quality characteristics used in the laboratory into visual terms that can be easily used by consumers details on these characteristics are given by juliano 1973 1979 disease resistance rice is often cultivated yearround in the hot humid tropics these conditions encourage rapid buildup of pathogenic organisms ou 1972 the breeding of resistant varieties is the most practical way to control diseases sources of resistance to important diseases of rice have been identified at irri and elsewhere numerous rices with resistance to blast tungro virus and bacterial blight have been identified however one strain of o nivara is the only current breeding programs 187 source of resistance to grassy stunt virus that has been identified ling et al 1970 the sources of resistance often tall donor parents were crossed with an improved plant type parent and the improved plant types segregating with resistance to the diseases in question were selected the improved planttype lines with resistance to different diseases were intercrossed to obtain lines with multiple resistance at irri resistance to as many as five diseases has been combined khush and beachell 1972 khush and coffman 1977 the disease resistance component of the irri geu program shares these materials with the national programs in asia and other rice producing areas of the world genetic improvement of rices with resistance to diseases is reviewed by khush 1977 insect resistance rice farmers in tropical asia generally use small amounts of insecticides and then only when crop damage is visible but when a farmer observes damage it is often too late to control the insect such insecticide treatment is also ineffective if the insect transmits a virus disease to the ricecrop the initial success of ir20 an early insect resistant variety showed that farmers quickly adopt rice varieties that are resistant to insect pests not only does insect resistance stabilize yields in farmers fields it also lowers production costs devastation of the rice crop by insects however remains a constant threat in asia many of the popular rice varieties lack resistance to the brown plant hopper other insects still of minor economic importance have the potential to become a serious menace and the development of the new brown planthopper biotypea variation within the species making it capable of overcoming a rice plants resistance to attackremains a somber threat to rice growers throughout south and southeast asia nevertheless clearcut cases of host resistance to several insect species harmful to rice have been speedily incorporated into varieties with improved plant type however improved varieties with resistance to several important insect species are still not available details on the resistance of rice to insects are given by pathak 1972 and khush 1977 except in resistance to whorl maggot and sheath blight the modern genetic materials are definitely superior to the traditional varieties these modern pest resistant lines are made available to rice scientists worldwide through the international rice testing program irtp protein content rice protein is one of the most nutritious of all cereal proteins it is relatively rich in lysine about 4 of the protein fraction a commonly limiting essential amino acid of cereals however the protein content of milled rice is relatively low about 7 at 14 moisture increasing the protein content of rice would mean an increased supply of protein in ricebased diets efforts at irri to improve rice protein content go back to 1966 when screening of the world germ plasm collection to identify high protein varieties started ir480 59 was identified as a high protein improved line through 188 varietal development of rice screening of advanced breeding lines de datta et al 1972 all improved irri breeding lines are now screened for protein content breeding for high protein rices includes conventional methods as well as reinforcing genetic factors for high protein content in a single genotype a breeding scheme called long cycle recurrent selection nanda and coffman 1979 several factors have impeded success in developing high protein breeding lines with high yield potential protein content in rice has a complex genetic system chang and somrith protein content is greatly influenced by environment heritability values for protein content are low suprihatno 1976 there appears to be quadratic relationship between grain yield and protein 1979 content grain yield and protein content may be improved simultaneously up to a point beyond which an increase in protein results in a decrease in grain yield fig 66 weather and cultural practices such as rate of fertilizer application water management and weed control also affect levels of protein these factors complicate selective breeding for higher protein nevertheless the high protein line ir480 59 yields well under disease free conditions and produces high protein grains on farmers fields in the philippines table 61 drought tolerance rice is normally grown in the tropics during periods of high rainfall but the time and intensity of rainfall varies markedly and the crop is often subjected to periods of severe moisture stress a major objective of geu research is to develop rice varieties that will tolerate drought and then recuperate quickly when the rains come drought tolerant varieties are most needed by upland rice farmers drought tolerance is also important for rainfed lowland rice the yields of which are often limited by unseasonal drought even deepwater rices must have some drought tolerance because in some countries the crop is direct seeded into dry soil long before flooding occurs mass screening techniques for drought tolerance have been developed chang table 61 grain yield and brown rice protein content of ir8 and ir480 59 grown as an

differences for drought tolerance have been noted among rice varieties for example varieties salumpikit and pinursigi from the philippines nam sagui 19 and ku 86 from thailand arc 10372 from india and dj 29 and dv 110 from bangladesh are highly drought tolerant many varieties tolerant of drought in the field have a high proportion of long deep and thick roots which reach into the subsoil for water during moisture stress chang et al 1972 others are semidwarf modern rices such as ir36 and ir442 258 which do not have deep root systems but have good levels of drought tolerance tolerance for adverse soil factors millions of hectares of land poten tially suitable for growing rice remain uncultivated because of soil toxicities caused by salt alkali acid or organic matter additionally vast areas have deficiencies of zinc phosphorus and iron or an excess of iron aluminum and manganese that limit rice yields at irri and in some national programs rice 190 varietal development of rice germ plasm is screened to identify varieties with natural tolerance to these soil problems deepwater and flood tolerance in vast areas of south and southeast asia the water level during the growing season is too deep for the high yielding semidwarf varieties the traditional varieties grown in deepwater and floating rice areas are sensitive to photoperiod which allows them to mature after the rainy season is over and the floodwater had receded early generation lines from irris geu and other national programs such as in thailand bangladesh india and indonesia are extensively evaluated where the problems exist irri 1977 temperature tolerance temperature extremes are important limiting factors in many rice growing countries germ plasm tolerant of low and high temperatures have been identified and are being evaluated in various areas affected by low or high temperatures specific breeding lines from the geu programs are screened for tolerance for high or low temperatures distribution exchange and

rice improvement programs in asia the following are examples of national breeding programs where major accomplishments have been made india introduction of the semidwarf variety taichung native 1 to india in the 1960s signaled a new era in indias rice breeding programs at about the same time national rice improvement efforts were reinforced with the initiation of a countrywide testing network under aicrip the introduction of these midwarf rice enriched the variety trials with several promising breeding lines of a productive plant type which had been generated at the national institutes and at several breeding stations in different states some of the native traditional tall varieties proved to be excellent sources of genetic material for developing semidwarfs suited to diverse situations

in varieties for those areas have been made but success is limited salinity tolerance is an important trait needed for rices grown in bangladeshs coastal areas sri lanka the climatic and edaphic diversity of sri lankas rice growing regions imposes the need for varieties with photoperiod insensitivity and different maturity current breeding programs 193 classes ranging from 3 to 55 months as well as those that are photoperiod sensitive and mature in the 556 months range varieties with improved plant type and semidwarf growth habit have been bred and released for cultivation since 1970

brown planthopper and gall midge which have assumed major importance within the last few years resistance to those insects has been incorporated in the latest varieties released bg 4001 45month duration and bg 2765 3month duration the adoption of the new semidwarf varieties was rapid particularly during 19711974 these varieties now occupy the highly productive areas characterized by adequate irrigation water fertile soils and high solar radiation purelines and other varieties h4 h7 h8 and 62355 cover the rest of the rice lands in the less productive areas which are beset by excesses or deficiencies of water poor soils unfavorable temperatures low solar radiation and so on breeding of varieties suitable for the less productive areas has produced varieties with 45month duration such

are high yield potential yield stability desirable agronomic characteristics high grain quality blast resistance and drought tolerance among the desirable agronomic characteristics a plant height of 100 120 cm current breeding programs 195 is considered optimal in certain regions with a bimodal rainfall pattern such as in western cameroon two rice crops can be grown per year for that an early or medium growth duration variety is required in other areas the growth duration of rice varieties must be suitable for different cropping systems jacquot 1978 upland rice improvement programs in west africa are discussed by abifarin et al 1972 for lowland rice introduced rice varieties such as ir5 and ir20 are most widely planted to develop modern varieties for africa buddenhagen 1978 and virmani et al 1978 proposed that they should be matched to important ecosystems in a country about 91 of tropical africas rice is cultivated in malagasy republic sierra leone nigeria guinea ivory coast tanzania liberia mali and others most of the hybridization and selection of segregating materials in anglophone africa has been in sierra leone nigeria and liberia with a little in tanzania virmani et al 1978 the success of upland rice in terms of the number of varieties has come primarily from selection among african varieties and hybridization between african and exotic varieties the latter has been practiced in nigeria and sierra leone the most popular rice varieties grown as upland are lac 23 rok 3 and faya which are in fact selections from farmers varieties for the francophone countries in africa most of the varietal improvement programs were carried out by irat particularly the improvement of upland rice historically the national institute for the development of the congo now ineal zaire began collecting rice ecotypes in 1933 and produced such varieties as r66 and os6 jacquot 1978 os6 is extensively grown in west africa moroberekan a local variety from the northern ivory coast is grown extensively in west africa under upland rice culture rice improvement in south america three examples can be given for varietal improvement of rice in south america they are lowland rice in colombia and surinam and upland rice in brazil colombia in 1969 about 66 million hectares were planted to rice in latin america the most successful breeding program was developed in colombia with cooperation between centro internacional de agricultura tropical ciat and instituto colombiano agropecuario ica that program developed superior varieties with high yield potential improved plant type strong seedling vigor moderately heavy tillering semidwarf stature and erect leaves early maturity 90 120 days resistance to blast and sheath blight resistance to hoja blanca virus and its insect vector sogatodes orizicola muir and good milling and cooking quality from the ciat ica collaboration the first variety cica 4 was developed from the segregating population of ir930 3111b cica combines the initials of ciat and ica cica 4 is resistant to hoja blanca and highly resistant to 196 varietal development of rice sogatodes it is susceptible to blast however rosero 1972 ir22 also has become an important variety in colombia cica9 was released in 1976 and is now grown not only as lowland rice in colombia but as upland rice in costa rica and panama it has higher yield potential and greater disease resistance than previously used varieties it is also somewhat taller than the other colombian varieties cica9 and other varieties being developed in colombia promise to make a sizable contribution to higher rice yields in latin america surinam a number of varieties developed in surinam have unique morphological and grain characteristics many of these rices are about 130 cm tall have dark green long narrow leaves and are generally low tillering with relatively good straw strength the grains are very long some examples of surinam varieties are alupi awini cauponi apuri and

for upland ricegrowing areas in brazil the instituto agronomico at campinas iac has developed several rices with tall stature and good drought tolerance examples are iac 1246 iac 47 and iac 25 the latter matures about 10 days earlier than the other two and escapes the drought period locally known as veranico see chapter 2 breeding programs in the temperate regions in temperate asia impressive gains in rice yields have been made through varietal improvement japan development of the variety hoyoku was the most significant event in breeding for high rice yields in japan hoyoku was developed at the kyushu agricultural experiment station in 1961 by crossing jukkoku female parent with zensho 26 male parent kariya 1966 jukkoku has a short stem and is highly resistant to lodging but susceptible to blast and bacterial leaf blight zensho 26 is resistant to bacterial leaf blight hoyoku has a short stem is highly responsive to fertilizer and its development may be considered of

northern kyushu table 62 compares plant characters and yield components of hoyoku and norin 18 since the development of hoyoku only minor improvements have been made in increasing yield potential of japanese varieties through breeding most of the improvements in yields have been through improvements in management practices shigemura 1966 reviewed yearly average rice yields for each of japans prefectures for the past 100 years and found that the high yielding rice growing area had shifted from southwestern areas to the northwestern districts of tohoku and hokuriku toriyama 1979 summarizes details on rice breeding programs and the current status of varietal improvement in rice in japan china breeders in china work closely with researchers in the production teams brigades and communes methods used are introduction pureline selection hybridization radiation treatment and haploid breeding using anther culture hybridization is done by county agricultural institutes and provincial agri cultural academies most of the rice improvement work in china has been to improve agronomic characteristics high yields and short growth duration have been emphasized most of the japonica varieties in the northern regions and the second crop japonica varieties in the central regions mature in 150 days any reduction in growth duration of those varieties without sacrificing yield would be extremely beneficial short growth duration has also been a major breeding objective because early maturing varieties were essential for the multiple cropping systems developed in china chinese breeders bred many early maturing indica varieties 198 varietal development of rice such as guang luai 4 and ai nantsao 1 which are grown widely in central and southern china at present first crop rice varieties zhen zhuai guan luai 4 xianfang er jiuging lu shuang 1011 and second crop rice varieties bao xuan 2 nan jing 11 and dong tingwuan xian are widely grown in the southern region shen 1980 to increase the yield potential of rice the chinese have put major emphasis on reduction of plant height as a way to decrease lodging the japonica varieties of northern and central china have been selected progressively for shorter height during several decades and most are now between 80 and 110 cm in height they are highly responsive to nitrogen fertilizer and have good lodging resistance high tillering capacity is not considered an important rice plant trait in china apparently the large number of seedlings per hill more than 10 used in the chinese production system offsets any disadvantage of low tillering varieties the chinese consider photoperiod sensitivity an important trait for the second crop of rice in the two ricecrop system or for the third crop in the three ricecrop systems in the south with increased intensity of cropping tolerance for extreme temperatures in rice has become an essential feature in breeding work irri 1978a there were also efforts to develop rice varieties resistant to blast planthoppers leafhoppers and stem borers other methods of varietal development include hybrid breeding and wide crosses crossing of rice with sorghum and other grasses efforts are made to develop high yielding varieties with high photosynthetic efficiency republic of korea one of the remarkable success stories of rice production is that of korea for 19651975 although korea has had a long history of breeding and testing programs in 1965 a cooperative rice research program was initiated with irri one of the first crosses made at irri and tested in korea was between a japanese variety yukura and the short statured taichung native 1 the f 1 progeny was then crossed with ir8 the most promising selection from that triple cross was ir667 98 which was named tong il in 1972 in subsequent years several newer tong il type varieties have been developed from the indica japonica crossing program tong il and the related semidwarf varieties were resistant to blast and stripe virus but susceptible to insects of the semidwarf varieties milyang 30 is resistant to many destructive insects choi 1978 by 1978 about 76 of koreas rice growing areas were planted to the new varieties figure 68 shows remarkable gain in rice yields over the years making koreas the highest national average in the world in 1979 the area planted to the tong il semidwarfs have probably dropped somewhat due to a blast disease problem that affected large areas in 1978 the blast outbreak was attributed to heavy fertilizer applications and a new race of blast that attacked only the newer rices current breeding programs 199 figure 68 grain yield of rough rice in the republic of korea 1960 1979 adapted from office of rural development korea 1979 and ministry

incorporation of the semidwarf gene in the us rice varieties has been slow however louisiana the primary objective of the louisiana varietal improvement program is to develop high yielding semidwarfs superior to the current commercial varieties hybridization of appropriate stocks followed by selection of resulting progenies has in fact resulted in development of a considerable number of high tillering nitrogen responsive lines with desirable plant type and resistance to some diseases progress however has been slow because crosses with ir8 taichung native 1 and the other semidwarf

major objective in breeding rices for new south wales semidwarfs developed in california are being used for incor porating lodging resistance into japonica varieties grown in new south wales breeding methods and procedures the breeding objectives and the facilities available to the breeders have an important bearing on the method used breeding methods the selection method of plant breeding has been used from time immemorial to select new varieties from old varieties that may have passed down from generation to generation of farmers other methods have been developed as science has advanced and new technology has become available breeding methods and procedures 203 pure line selection for a pure line breeding program to be successful the base population or the original variety must have genetic variability because selection can act on heritable differences only for pure line breeding a large number of plant selections are made from the genetically variable original population as a second step progeny rows from the individual plant selections are grown for initial evaluation as a final step promising selections are compared with each other and the parent variety in the replicated yield trials and the highest yield lines are released as a pure line variety mass selection the main difference between mass selection and the pure line selection method is that a number of plants rather than just one are selected to make up the new variety the varieties developed by this method include fewer genotypes than the parent population but more than the single genotype of varieties developed by the pure line selection the number and variability of types included depend upon the variability of the original population and the intensity of selection practiced in some countries mass selection finds its greatest use in purification of existing varieties in connection with pure seed programs in south and southeast asia mass selection can be profitably employed in purifying old varieties of rice that are under cultivation and in maintaining the genetic purity of new high yielding improved plant type varieties being developed hybridization as plant breeding has progressed and more of the natural variability existing within the populations of rice as a self pollinated species has been exploited it has become increasingly important for the plant breeder to generate new variability and to produce desired recombination by making artificial hybrids the hybrids are allowed to self pollinate and the resulting populations are handled either by the bulk method the backcross method or the pedigree method bulk breeding in japan the bulk method of breeding has been widely used in experiment stations because in general the effectiveness of selection in early generations of rice hybrids is low for quantitatively inherited traits including yield particularly in individual plant selections selection in advanced generations that have been purified somewhat is effective for such traits for these reasons the bulk method without plant selections in early generations seems to be more suitable to 204 varietal development of rice breeding for yield increase than the pedigree method particularly on a small scale labor saving is also a great concern of rice breeders in japan finally procedures for shortening breeding cycles in a greenhouse are practicable only by means of the bulk method okabe 1972 despite its inherent advantages of simplicity and convenience years of bulk breeding in tropical asia have not produced significant gains in developing rices with high yields at present the bulk method as practiced earlier is not used because it does not permit concurrent screening for resistance to a number of diseases and insects khush 1978 backcross breeding the backcross method has not been used extensively because of a lack of suitable recurrent parents the major disadvantage of backcrossing is that no single variety is so nearly ideal that it needs to be improved in only one character however at irri a few backcrosses have been made in the crosses with oryza nivara for grassy stunt resistance ir8 and ir24 were used as recurrent parents at present several named varieties such as ir28 ir32 ir34 ir36 ir40 and ir42 are being used as recurrent parents in a backcrossing program khush 1978 backcrossing is also used to develop isogenic lines with different genes for resistance to the brown planthopper simple inheritance and high heritability of the character to be improved through backcrossing are the prerequisites for successful use of the method pedigree breeding the pedigree method has been the most widely used in rice improvement early generations of fieldselected plants can be evaluated in special tests for characters such as insect and disease resistance and grain quality the method provides a sound basis for the discarding of undesirable lines and results in the concentra tion of useful material jennings et al 1979 the pedigree method is highly suitable to develop rices with resistance to insects and diseases if the resistance is governed by major genes it is possible therefore to combine genes for resistance to six or seven major diseases and insects in a short period khush 1978 the major disadvantage of pedigree breeding is that it requires much time to evaluate lines periodically throughout the growing season and to keep records on which selection is based at maturity of all breeding methods the pedigree method requires the greatest familiarity with the material and with the relative effects of genotype and environment on character expression for traits governed by polygenes the pedigree method of breeding is not the most effective approach for example resistance to stem borers and sheath blight appears to be under polygenic control for these two traits khush 1978 suggested a diallel selective mating system proposed by jensen 1970 breeding methods and procedures 205 rapid generation advance with rapid generation advance which is a modified form of the bulk method it is possible to grow three or four generations in a year goulden 1939 okochi et al 1958 no selection is practiced during that period to develop insect and disease resistant lines the bulk population at f 5 or f 6 is exposed to the disease or insect pressure and individuals with better level of resistance are identified and grown in progeny rows for further evaluation mutation breeding variability caused by induced mutations is not essentially different from variability caused by spontaneous mutations during evolution x rays gamma rays and neutrons are effective ionizing radiations for mutation induction ethyl methane sulfonate ems is one of several chemical mutagens that has been used the direct use of mutations is a valuable supplementary approach to plant breeding particularly when it is desired to improve one or two easily identifiable characters in an otherwise well adapted variety induced mutations offer three advantages iaea 1971 1 they are capable of conferring specific improvements to varieties without otherwise significantly affecting their performance and the time required for such specific improvement is shorter than if only hybridization is used 2 they represent the only possible method of creating a character that is not found in the natural population and their use is often theeasiest and quickest method if the desired character is part of an undesirable genotype 3 they offer a method of breaking tight linkages producing translocations for gene transfer mutational changes of agronomic importance that have been reported are plant height flowering and maturity period resistance to diseases and insects and increased protein content in rice one of the earlier reports on the use of mutagenic agents to induce artificial variability in rice in relation to x ray induced mutants is geb 24 in india ramiah and parthasarathy 1938 some of the successful varieties developed by mutation breeding are as follows mikaelsen 1980 variety country and date reimei japan 1966 jagannath india 1969 irat 13 ivory coast 1974 calrose 76 usa 1976 206 varietal development of rice variety country and date hokuriku 100 japan 1976 m7 usa 1977 rd6 thailand 1977 hybrid breeding the phenomenon of heterosis or hybrid vigor has been exploited commercially in maize pearl millet and sorghum and its possible use in wheat and rice is being explored essential prerequisites to a successful hybrid breeding program are presence of true f 1 superiority or heterobeltiosis that is the f 1 hybrid is superior to the better parent not only superior to the mean of the two parents as in heterosis availability of efficient cytoplasmic genetic male sterile and fertility restorer lines ability of the male sterile lines to show satisfactory seed set through cross pollination heterosis and heterobeltiosis many rice crosses have been reported to show heterosis but some specific cross combinations have also shown significant true f 1 superiority or heterobeltiosis davis and rutger 1976 lin and yuan 1980 the extent of the f 1 yield advantage over the better parent has been found to range from 10 to 210 in experiments using limited population size and noncommercial planting densities however results from china which are based on large production plots and commercial planting densities have indicated clearly that hybrid varieties had a yield advantage of 20 30 over the best conventionally bred varieties the highest yield obtained from an f 1 hybrid was 12 tha chang 1979a cytoplasmicgenetic male sterility and fertility restoration a cytoplasmic genetic male sterility system depends on cytoplasmic and genetic factors plants carrying a particular type of cytoplasm in combination with recessive alleles of pollen fertility genes in the nucleus would produce aborted pollen but would produce seeds if cross pollinated indicating that ovule fertility is normal the f 1 offspring from a cytoplasmic genetic male sterile plant would be pollen sterile if the pollen parent contributed the same recessive alleles of genes in the nucleus as in the male sterile plant such a pollen parent is called a maintainer line because it enables maintenance of the sterility of a male sterile plant on the other hand if a pollen parent contributed dominant alleles of genes responsible for pollen fertility the f 1 offspring from a cytoplasmic genetic male sterile plant would be pollen fertile such a pollen parent is called restorer line because it enables restoration of the pollen fertility in the offspring of a male sterile plant breeding methods and procedures 207 figure 611 cytoplasmic genetic male sterility and fertility restoration system s sterility inducing cytoplasm n normal cytoplasm rf dominant allele for pollen fertility in the nucleus rf recessive allele for pollen fertility in the nucleus the mechanism of cytoplasmic genetic male sterility in a plant is explained in fig 611 the cytoplasmic genetic male sterility is also often designated as cytoplasmic male sterility because the male sterile and its corresponding male fertile maintainer line differ only with regard to cytoplasm the genetic constitution of the two is identical several cytoplasmic male sterile lines have been identified or developed or both in indica as well as japonica rices katsuo and mizushima 1958 shinjyo 1969 athwal and virmani 1972 in china a number of agronomically superior cytoplasmic male sterile lines such as er chiunan 1a zhen shan 97a v20a v41a yar aizhao a chen bao 1a lien tong tsao a and others have been developed for use in the hybrid breeding program lin and yuan 1980 two irri varieties ir24 and ir26 have been identified as effective restorers for these cytoplasmic male sterile lines and used extensively in the development of commercial hybrids natural outcrossing and seed set for hybrid seed production the ease and cost of production of hybrid seed for rice will determine to what extent the hybrid breeding approach can be used in other rice growing countries in the world the floral structure of rice is not well adapted to cross pollination and less than 1 natural outcrossing is observed normally however on male sterile plants 3345 seed set has been obtained in large scale hybrid seed production plots in china the highest frequency of cross pollination and seed set 74 was 208 varietal development of rice observed in the hunan province during early september when the daily mean temperature was 22 c or above chang 1979a research on the three lines cytosterile line maintainer and restorer of hybrid rice in china was started in 1964 but the major breakthrough in hybrid seed production was not realized until 1974 in 1978 the area growing hybrid rice in china covered 42 million hectares shen 1980 other reports lin and yuan 1980 shen 1980 chang 1979a suggest that china has effectively used hybrid rice breeding as an important tool for varietal improvement and that the method is feasible for developing new varieties varietal improvement through tissue culture techniques have been developed to regenerate rice plants from cultured cells bajaj 1980 diploid callus can be induced by plating surface sterilized seeds on chemically defined nutrient media haploid callus can be obtained from uninucleate pollen by plating immature rice anthers on media containing the basic nutrients for growth of plant cells and supplemented with growth regulators including 24 d and naphthalene acetic acid naa diploid cells can be treated with mutagenic agents and screened in vitro for mutants tolerant of herbicides salinity mineral deficiencies and toxicities and other yield constraints haploid cells generated through anther culture give rise to homozygous plants when the anthers are obtained from f 1 hybrids the regenerated plants have the same inherent genetic variability found in segregating f 2 populations from conventional crosses about 40 of the plants derived from haploid callus are diploid through spontaneous doubling of the chromosomes when the plant is differentiated additional diploid homozygous plants can be obtained by treating the growing point of haploid plantlets with mutagens because the plants obtained through anther culture are homozygous they give rise to homozygous breeding lines that can immediately be screened for disease and insect resistance agronomic characteristics and yield potential outstanding lines can be rapidly advanced through conventional seed multiplication programs because there will be no segregation in succeeding generations three difficulties have been encountered with rice tissue culture chaleff 1980 1 the morphogenetic capacity of the callus cultures may be lost rapidly during 2 only a small portion of cultured anthers give rise to callus 3 some of the regenerated plants may be albino green plants from callus range continued maintenance in culture from 5 to 90 in china some new varieties such as mu hua 1 heilongjiangsin siu shanghia and wandan 7 guangxi have been developed from pollen culture of hybrids of varietal and intersubspecific crosses shen 1980 breeding methods and procedures 209 breeding procedures the most important factor in developing a successful breeding program is to be systematic naturally a rice breeding program must aim to achieve its objectives but systematic program organization should permit maximum efficiency in screening and generation advances growing of donor parents and crossing each growing season donor parents should be grown for hybridization a broad based high volume crossing program is essential in any rice improvement effort types of crosses are single crosses a single cross is the hybridization of one variety or line with backcrosses a backcross is the cross of an f 1 to one of its parents topcrosses a topcross 3 way cross is the cross of an f 1 with a third double cross a double cross is a cross of two f 1 hybrids another variety or line variety or line details on operation and procedure in a hybridization program are given by jennings et al 1979 f 2 populations the intense interplant competition caused by differential tillering ability and sizes of neighboring plants in early segregating generations is a critical factor that affects the choice of breeding methods to minimize this problem jennings et al 1979 suggest multiple crosses involving both tall and dwarf parents and production of a large number of f 1 plants from these multiplecross com binations the resulting f 1 will have both tall and short phenotypes only the latter are advanced to the f 2 in the field f 2 populations from the individual f 1 plants of topcrosses or double crosses should be grown separately and selections should be made only from agronomi cally suitable crosses to develop insect and disease resistant varieties wherever feasible most of the f 2 populations should be grown without insecticides and fungicides to ensure insect and disease pressures khush 1978 although there is no ideal f 2 size for a single cross population a useful rule is to make them as large as possible especially for the wider crosses larger size of an f 2 population becomes imperative with emphasis on important recessive traits such as dwarf stature and also to permit a wide spectrum of recombina tions 210 varietal development of rice pedigree nurseries the pedigree nursery consists of progenies of single plant selections made in f 2 f 5 generations the pedigree nurseries are the heart of a rice improvement program good management and good judgment are more essential in handling pedigree nurseries than in any other phase of operation from a 25 to 30g seed sample 5 g of seed may be planted in a single 5m row in early generations and 3 rows per line in later generations the remaining seeds are then sent to individual specialists for screening for resistance to various insects and diseases and tolerance for drought or other stress problems yield trials selected f 5 f 6 or late generation rows should be evaluated for yield in replicated trials promising materials are then tested for yield potential and nitrogen responsiveness by agronomists collaborating in the program multilocation testing an important and integral part of plant breeding is testing of the breeding products as well as breeding sources in diverse agroclimates this provides an opportunity for the material to be exposed to various biological climatic and edaphic stresses and will not only help identify potential varieties and potential genes but will also reduce the time needed for development of varieties multilocation testing can be achieved through multicountry multidisciplinary collaborative research seed programs in any varietal improvement program it is essential to have an effective program on seed multiplication testing certification and distribution considerable attention must be given to a seed program if the farmer and the consumer are to benefit from improved varieties seed certification four classes are usually included in the seed certification program 1 breeder seed is the seed directly controlled by the originating or sponsoring plant institution or individual and the source for the production of seed for the certified classes 2 foundation seed is generated from the progeny of breeder seed foundation seed is handled to maintain genetic purity and identity production must be acceptable to the certifying agency breeding methods and procedures 211 3 registered seed is the progeny of breeder seed or foundation seed handled by a procedure acceptable to the certifying agency to maintain satisfactory genetic purity and identity 4 certified seed is the progeny of breeder foundation or registered seed which is handled to maintain satisfactory genetic purity and identity in a manner acceptable to the certifying agency breeder seed production breeders are often faced with the problem of having identified several excellent lines without being certain which should be named as a variety the breeder seed procedure allows the breeders to simultaneously multiply seed of the leading candidates and narrow them to the best one or two the following steps are suggested for multiplying breeder seed in tropical asia jennings et al 1979 six hundred panicles are selected from each line individually from either yield or regional trials each panicle is then inspected in the laboratory for uniformity of grain types and then threshed separately to speed multiplication the material is transplanted wherever possible in the single plant hills to facilitate roguing occasional off type plants are destroyed during frequent inspection of the material to avoid mixture extreme care is exercised when the field seed is bulk harvested dried cleaned and bagged about one ton of seed is harvested from the 600 panicles about 300 kg seed of the line is stored in an air conditioned room as breeder seed to be used for subsequent production of foundation seed seed viability remains excellent for 3 5 years if stored under low temperature and relative humidity the breeder seed is carefully separated and labeled to prevent mixture with other seed lot if questions are raised about varietal character istics the breeder seed is the ultimate source for rechecking in the united states the production of breeder and foundation seed is an integral part of the cooperative rice breeding projects of us department of agriculture and the state agricultural experiment stations adair et al 1973 the steps followed for initial testing are similar to those just described for tropical asia the minor differences are as follows once seeds are checked for uniformity they are stored in a small envelope the next year the seed from each panicle is sown in single rows 12 6 m long and 30 60 cm apart in some cases there are 90 cm alleys between ranges of rows to facilitate careful inspection and roguing the block of panicle rows of each variety is isolated from those varieties similar in maturity so as to eliminate natural crossing and subsequent segregation for off types 212 varietal development of rice in the early seedling stage off type plants or rows are identified and removed immediately or tagged for removal during harvesting albino seedlings are identified and removed at an early stage during the ripening period careful observations are made to detect variations in plant type plant height panicle type pubescence color of apex or apiculus and grain type if the entire group of panicle rows appears uniform the rows are harvested in bulk however if considerable variations exist due to genetic segregation then it may be necessary to make further selection of rows for purification this may be done by selection from within a block or rows or individual rows that appear to be uniform in appearance and that typify the variety being increased foundation seed production once dormancy is broken all or part of the breeder seed can be planted to produce foundation seed the area planted depends on the amount of foundation seed desired with 700 kg of seed 10 20 ha of foundation seed can be planted depending on the planting method used twenty hectares should produce 100 t of foundation seed enough to transplant 2500 ha or to directly grow 800 ha for production of registered seed jennings et al 1979 foundation seed fields should be rogued several times during the last part of the growing season in the united states roguing of foundation seed is facilitated by a space left every few meters by stopping up one or more of the holes in the farmtype grain drill used for seeding management practices should be followed that minimize lodging the release of foundation seed to growers is usually handled through a committee seed council or similar organization that allots the seed to carefully selected growers sometimes foundation seed is distributed directly to the growers from the state agricultural experiment station registered and certified seed production the production and certification of registered and certified seed are not part of the breeding program the details on cleaning grading and processing seed rice are described by adair et al 1973 according to jennings et al 1979 it requires at least 5 years from the time crosses are made until seed of new varieties are available to the farmers assuming that two generations can be advanced in a year this is possible only if growing conditions permit year round rice culture in temperate regions only one crop of rice can be grown a year but an alternate generation can be grown in a favorable climatic environment breeding methods and procedures 213 types of seed production programs probably all seed programs have started with government participation it is however desirable to strengthen private sector production program for initi ating seed multiplication in the united states and europe private enterprises are preferred to handle production of seeds semi government seed production in some countries the government establishes a national agency to produce process and distribute seed in general such agencies contract seed production to selected qualified farmers who operate as autonomous units and are usually financed by the government bank credits seed growers associations in some countries seed production is handled by a seed growers association which is a rapid and efficient method of handling seed multiplication and marketing of quality seeds table 64 standards a for the certification of rice seed adapted from huey 1977 standard for each class factor certified foundation

percentage of viable seed rice seed should be treated with a fungicide for control of seedling diseases table 64 shows an example of standards for certified seed that is regulated by the arkansas state plant board in the united states a main factor is that seed growers must receive adequate remuneration for their efforts while the interests of farmers are also protected seed growers extension workers and farmers must understand that pure seeds rarely deteriorate per se although new pest problems can reduce or shorten the usefulness of an improved variety chang 1979b details on the seed

of rice culture the systems of growing rice and the soil and crop management practices that have evolved for each system are complex and somewhat unique the systems were developed to suit specific environments and socioeconomic conditions of the farmers which makes a single classification system for rice landsone using all the production factorsextremely difficult instead several classification systems based on each areas or countrys rice production systems are followed classification of rice culture rice culture is classified according to source of water supply as rainfed or irrigated based on land and water management practices rice lands are classified as lowland wetland preparation of fields upland dryland preparation of fields then according to water regime rice lands have been classified as upland with no standing water lowland with 5 50 cm of standing water deepwater with 51 cm to 5 6 meters of standing water figure 71 diagrams the worlds rice land classification by water regime and predominant rice types based on varietal type used rice culture can be further classified into lowland rice with plants of semidwarf to medium to tall 100 cm to 2 m upland rice with plants of medium to tall 130 150 cm height deepwater rice with plants of medium to tall 120 150 cm tall without height standing water 2 3 m with rising water level height 221 222 systems of rice culture figure 71 the worlds rice lands classified by water regime and predominant rice types figures in parentheses are the percent of the worlds ricegrowing area that grows that type of rice culture floating rice with tall 150 cm tall without standing water 56 meters tall with rising floodwater plants precise data are lacking on the extent of different rice cultures in many countries the rainfed and irrigated areas cannot be precisely differentiated because statistics on irrigated areas in tropical asia include areas where only supplemental water is supplied during the monsoonal season within the cultures there exists a continuum of water conditions from very good water control to very poor water control for south and southeast asia barker and herdt 1979 classified rice lands into irrigated shallow rainfed deepwater and upland rice growing areas and estimated the production for each fig 72 lowland and deepwater ricegrowing areas can be more precisely classified to suit water regime varietal requirement and land preparation and stand establishment techniques in many ricegrowing areas of the tropics particularly in south and southeast asia the year is divided into fairly distinct wet and dry seasons in most areas the bulk of the rice is produced in the wet season and dependence on rainfall is the most limiting production constraint for rainfed rice culture because rainfall received during the dry season is not enough to grow a crop of rice rice grown in that season is entirely an irrigated crop and because development of irrigation facilities is costly and moves slowly the area planted to rice in the dry season is limited classification of rice culture 223 figure 72 estimate of the percentage of rice crop area and production by specified environmental complex in south and southeast asia mid 1970s adapted from barker and herdt 1979 the principal rice growing seasons of various rice growing countries are shown in fig 73 examples of growing seasons and rice based cropping systems in china are shown in fig 74 in all of the rice growing countries in asia lowland rice culture is the most predominant system followed on the other hand in africa and latin america upland rice culture is the major system for west africa buddenhagen 1978 classified rice culture into four main types and eight subtypes based on climate soil conditions water regime and technological level of agriculture they are 1 upland dryland hydromorphic 2 irrigated 3 inland swamp nontoxic soil toxic soil 4 flooded riverine shallow riverine deep boliland mangrove 224 systems of rice culture figure 73 rice seasons and rice based cropping systems in various countries in asia adapted from kung nd and tanaka 1976 west africas 187 million hectares of rice lands however equal only a little more than 50 of the ricegrowing area in the philippines and only 14 of the worlds ricegrowing area in all of latin america rice is grown on 65 million hectares which is less than the ricegrowing area of bangladesh or indonesia the statistics on ricegrowing areas make it clear that asia is the most important ricegrowing region in the world rainfed rice covers most rice growing areas in the world although yield per crop is high in irrigated areas classification of rice culture 225 figure 73 continued classification of rainfed rice culture it is difficult to classify rainfed rice lands accurately according to water depths it is equally difficult to estimate the area under each water depth and system of rice culture recently barker and herdt 1979 classified rice lands of south and southeast asia according to water depths for lowland rainfed rice they used shallow rainfed 5 15 cm and medium deep rainfed 16 100 cm with medium deep rainfed further classified into intermediatedeep 15 50 cm and semideep 226 systems of rice culture figure 73 continued rainfed 51100 cm where water depth exceeds 100 cm they classified rice lands as deepwater there are distinct disadvantages to grouping intermediate deep and semideep rice areas into medium deep lowland areas the rices and technology required for intermediate deep and semideep lowland areas are distinctly different in addition in contrast to the sharp distinction between upland and lowland rice the transition from lowland to deepwater is less abrupt krishnamoorty 1979 as is the transition between deepwater and floating rice areas from an agronomic management viewpoint it is desirable to separate rainfed lowland rice culture classification of rice culture 227 figure 74 ricebased cropping systems in rice growing areas of the peoples republic of china adapted from report on irri teams visit to china 1976 and irri 1978 which is primarily transplanted in a puddled soil from deepwater and floating rice cultures which are direct seeded onto dry soil further refinements can be made of the classification system suggested by barker and herdt 1979 with both deepwater and floating rice areas totally excluded from the rainfed lowland rice areas the refinements of classification are main method maximum water types of rice culture of planting depth cm rainfed lowland rice transplant 0 50

51100 dry soil floating rice broadcast onto 101600 dry soil upland rice broadcast or no standing drilled into water dry soil with this classification the rainfed lowland rice areas include those where maximum water depth is 50 cm in such areas fields are generally prepared wet and rice is transplanted in puddled soil although direct seeding onto puddled or in dry soil is practiced in some countries by separating deepwater and floating rice cultures it is possible to concentrate on research specific to deepwater rice culture production methodology and cultural practices followed in each system of rice culture vary greatly in this chapter descriptions are given for various systems of rice culture such as rainfed lowland irrigated lowland deepwater floating rice and upland rice under each system of rice culture varietal requirement and cultural practices not discussed elsewhere in this book are briefly mentioned details on other production factors such as land preparation water manage ment fertilizer management weed control insects and diseases and their control measures and harvesting and postharvest operations are discussed in other chapters lowland rice culture in most rice growing countries rice is usually grown as a lowland wetland crop under this system land is either prepared wet or dry but water is always held on the field by bunds about 30 of the worlds rice is grown as rainfed lowland and about 45 as irrigated lowland fig 71 crop establishment for both rainfed lowland and irrigated lowland rice the raising and handling of seedlings and plant density are generally similar raising seedlings for lowland rice in the tropics seedlings are grown at the time there is an adequate moisture supply in the case of irrigated rice seedlings can be grown any time of the year as needed for rainfed rice the starting of seedbeds usually conforms with the onset of monsoonal rains lowland rice culture 229 seeds of many tropical rice varieties have a dormancy period a dormancy period of 2 3 weeks in rice seeds is an important advantage in the tropics especially for the wet season crop when high temperature and humidity at harvest would result in germination on the panicle if there is no dormancy for seedbed seeding farmers have to wait until the dormancy period is over or break it by heat 50o c for 5 days waiting until the end of the domancy period is the usual practice rice seeds are soaked in water for 24 hours and then incubated for 48 hours before they are placed on the seedbed this pregermination process assures a quick and even start of the seedbed the three major methods of raising seedlings are the wet bed the dapog and the dry bed the wet bed is most widely used wetbed in the wet bed method pregerminated seeds are broadcast uniformly on a raised bed of puddled soil and the seedlings are ready for transplanting 20 25 days after the seed is sown rate of seeding is about 100 gm 2 of seedbed which amounts to a rate of about 50 kgha dapog the dapog method of raising seedlings was developed in laguna province philippines and is commonly used in that region its use spread to other parts of the philippines and to other asian countries for a dapog seedbed the land is prepared as in the wet bed method but banana leaves or plastic sheets are used to cover the soil or a concreted area is used as a bed the dapog bed should be about 15 m wide and its length will depend on the area to be planted banana bracts are placed on the seedbed with bamboo pegs to keep the leaves in position the dapog method seeding rate is 3000 gm 2 of bed which gives a rate of 100 kgha about twice that of the wet bed method dapog seedlings are ready for transplanting 914 days after the seed is sown the advantages of this method are labor savings because the bed is easily made the short period for raising seedlings and relative ease of transport of seedlings because a mat of seedlings can be rolled seedlings raised in wet or dry beds have to be pulled bundled and tied for transport drybed the dry bed method is not used extensively in the asian tropics although it is popular in the philippines on the clayey soils in the rainfed lowland areas where there is insufficient water to irrigate seedbeds dry bed seedlings are grown in a manner similar to that used for wet bed seedlings except that the soil is not puddled and drainage is provided to keep the soil moist but not inundated in the philippines farmers construct a small paddy near a source of water and water the seedlings two or three times daily the seeding rate is the same as for the wet bed method 100 gm 2 in any of these three methods of raising seedlings the seedbed should be protected from insects and diseases because the area to protect is small the cost of protecting seedlings is not prohibitive the choice of seedbed method depends on the availability of water studies in the philippines suggest similar growth characteristics and grain yield with 230 systems of rice culture seedlings raised by the three different methods at maturity the plants from all seedbeds are taller in the wet than in the dry season taller seedlings are desirable in the wet season because of sudden floods which may cause damage to the rice crop during the early stage age and handling of seedlings an even stand containing the optimum number of optimum age seedlings is essential for proper crop development and high grain yields when photoperiod sensitive varieties are grown it is fairly common to transplant seedlings that are 40 50 days old however the best age for transplanting wet bed seedlings is 20 30 days in general the earlier the variety matures the sooner the seedlings should be transplanted thirtyday or older seedlings recover more slowly than younger seedlings especially if they suffer from too much stem or root injury during pulling such injuries reduce tillering prolong maturity and may reduce grain yield it is desirable to flood the wet and dry seedbeds one day before pulling the seedlings flooding softens the soil and facilitates seedling pulling for dapog seedlings the seedbed is cut into convenient sizes and the seedling mats are rolled with the roots outward dapog seedlings are ready for transplanting 9 14 days after sowing regardless of maturity days of the variety used handling seedlings with care is more important for modern varieties than for traditional varieties irrespective of the method of raising seedlings it is important to handle the seedlings carefully to enable the transplanted seedlings to revive and resume growth in the main field as quickly as possible this is particularly important in the rainfed rice where early revival and rapid growth immediately after transplanting may mean avoiding damage from submergence by floods or heavy rain soon after transplanting or from later dry weather number of seedlings per hill the number of seedlings planted per hectare depends on the method of raising seedlings and plant spacing ordinarily 3 4 seedlings per hill are planted from wetbed and 6 8 per hill from dapog seedbeds it is desirable to select rice varieties with high tillering capacity to ensure adequate number of tillers per hill in china where rice is almost entirely irrigated 8 10 seedlings per hill are commonly used this is because chinese varieties do not have high tillering capacity extra seedlings are however an expensive method of ensuring high tiller number in a given area the cost of extra seed may discourage most tropical asian farmers to plant a high number of seedlings per hill because of added seed cost plant spacing plant spacing is an important production factor in transplanted rice planting ice closer than necessary increases the cost of transplanting and the chances of lowland rice culture 231 lodging on the other hand spacing rice wider than necessary may result in lower yield because the number of plants in the area may be less than the optimum number needed for high yield in many countries in south and southeast asia rice is transplanted at a random spacing random planting is most common in rainfed rice particularly if traditional varieties are grown the advantages of straightrow planting are a rotary weeder can be used for weeding an optimum plant population is possible and it is easier to apply insecticides herbicides and topdressed fertilizers there is no single spacing practice best for all varieties optimum spacing of any variety depends on soil fertility and season of planting a uniform stand containing an optimum plant population is essential for proper crop develop ment and high grain yields in tropical asia rices of improved plant type and high tillering capacity can be planted at a wide range of spacings the tiller number per unit area in a rice population is largely a function of plant density the tiller number is positively or negatively correlated with grain yield depending on the rice variety and crop environment kawano and tanaka 1968 the effect of plant density on the yield of rice for traditional varieties vacchani and rao 1959 yin et al 1960 matsuo 1964 and modern varieties fagade and de datta 1971 has been studied for example the short lodging resistant photoperiodinsensitive varieties such as ir8 ir36 ir42 and ir50 should be spaced 20 25 cm in the wet season regardless of soil fertility in the dry season the tall and leafy heavytillering varieties such as peta are spaced 25 25 cm in relatively poor soil and 30 30 cm in fertile soil in the wet season the tall varieties are spaced 30 30 cm in the poor soil and 35 35 cm in fertile soil studies at irri suggest that the optimum spacing for the lodging susceptible tall variety peta is 50 50 cm whereas the optimum spacing for nonlodging short variety tainan3 is 30 30 cm in the wet season data on varietal response to plant density demonstrate that if there is no lodging the yields of most varieties do not change much as the planting distance is reduced below 2535 cm table 71 at closer spacings the yield per plant is small but this is compensated for by greater number of plants per unit area at distances greater than 35 cm between plants yields of most varieties are reduced because plant population per unit area is reduced most modern earlymaturing rices have a short vegetative period that limits the number of panicles formed thus dense planting of these varieties can overcome the limitation of a short vegetative period with poor weed control closely spaced rice competes better with weeds because of sunlight intercepted by the rice crop plant spacing and row orientation also affect the grain yield of rice matsuo 1964 nguu and de datta 1979 reported the effect of plant density on grain yield of rice grown with various levels of soil nitrogen the yield of two earlymaturing 232 systems of rice culture table 71 grain yield of modern and traditional varieties in relation to plant spacing irri 1967 adapted from mabbayad

rainfed lowland rice culture in tropical asia where rainfed lowland rice is almost synonymous to rice cultivation enough water has to accumulate in the field to soften the soil before plowing can be done dikes are essential for rainfed culture because the undependable water supply must be captured and controlled the usual method of stand establishment is transplanting although direct seeding onto puddled or dry fields is also practiced figure 75 seedling uprooting machine being developed in a commune factory in peoples republic of china figure 76 rice yield trends in bangladesh pakistan sri

areas resulting generally in no yield increases on farms in those areas for example rice yields in eastern india west bengal bihar orissa assam and eastern uttar pradesh have not increased much since the mid 1960s when the modern rice varieties were introduced fig 76 on the other hand where water control was good such as in northern punjab and southern india andhra pradesh and tamil nadu pakistan and sri lanka rice yields increased steadily over those years particularly after the introduction of modern varieties stand establishment techniques rainfed lowland rice can be classified according to stand establishment techniques transplanted in puddled soil direct seeded with pregerminated seeds on puddled soil direct seeded on dry soil transplanted rice transplanted rice is the major system of rainfed rice culture in most of tropical asia primarily as a monsoonal crop it has been the most important crop in the indian subcontinent and its success or failure means abundance or deficit islam

varieties are grown in shallow rainfed lowland rice growing areas early maturing semidwarfs such as ir36 are grown in many shallow rainfed areas in the philippines in most 236 systems of rice culture rainfed areas in south and southeast asia however taller varieties with or without photoperiod sensitivity are widely grown in mediumdeep rainfed lowland ricegrowing areas tall varieties that are mostly photoperiodsensitive are grown although some tall varieties essentially photoperiodinsensitive are grown in some areas for example mashuri an indica japonica cross which was developed in malaysia is extremely popular in mediumdeep rainfed areas in india and burma see chapter 6 varieties with moderate elongating capacity such as the ir442 type are well suited in mediumdeep rainfed areas but these rices must have some photo period sensitivity to delay harvesting until the floodwater has receded sub mergence tolerance particularly at the seedling and early tillering stages is desirable in rices for mediumdeep rainfed lowland areas in the region covering 1530n latitudes and 70120e longitudes of south and southeast asia covering eastern india assam bihar west bengal states bangladesh nepal parts of burma laos and vietnam islam 1980 the photoperiodsensitive varieties are grown their maturity is controlled by short days less than 12 hours and cool climate less than 27 c particularly during the reproductive and ripening stages of crop growth however photoperiod sensitive varieties are also grown in lower latitudes of southern asia including malaysia and indonesia in northeastern india about 87 of ricegrowing area is grown to tall photoperiodsensitive varieties or varieties with intermediate plant height mukherji 1980 such as pankaj mashuri and ir442 lines which are essentially insensitive to photoperiod in bangladesh the photoperiodsensitive variety nazirsail is most widely grown photoperiodsensitive varieties remain in the active and lag vegetative stages during the main part of the monsoon season however the transplanted aman crop is often subjected to flash floods and reduction in stand due to seedling submergence therefore submergence tolerance is a desirable character ahmad 1980 in thailand the entire central plains and northeast and the southern rice growing regions grow photoperiodsensitive tall varieties figure 77 shows the maturity range of photoperiodsensitive varieties in four ricegrowing regions in thailand wetseeded lowland rice in some rainfed areas in the asian tropics wetseeded lowland rice culture is an important system wet seeding is usually by broadcasting in sri lanka parts of india bangladesh and the philippines pregerminated seeds are broadcast onto puddled fields without much standing water fields are prepared wet with various degrees of puddling stand establishment is often poor because of poor land preparation weed competition and poor water control farmers in indonesia prepare the land with a hand hoe or spade in java farmers may prepare the land wet or dry depending on the moisture accumula tion in the field when the amount of rain water is more than 200 mm for a rainfed lowland rice culture 237 figure 77 flowering dates of photoperiod sensitive varieties recommended by the thai government according to region adapted from awakul 1980 month farmers generally opt for wetland preparation less than 200 mm of rainfall for the planting month leads to dryland preparation and seeding onto a dry or moist soil varietal requirement early maturing rices about 100day duration are preferred for wet seeded rice varieties should have excellent seedling vigor and good tillering capacity early maturing rices such as ir28 ir30 ir36 and ratna from india have been used successfully as broadcast wet seeded rice experimental results suggest that the yield potential for direct seeded drilled or broadcast rice is similar to that for transplanted lowland rice table 74 where rainfall distribution is good and farmers can puddle the field quickly and thoroughly it is often desirable to wet seed rice on a puddled soil in some parts of the philippines farmers claim that they stand a good chance of double cropping with rice if the first rice crop is wet seeded this is due primarily to the earliness in planting for wet seeded rice may june compared to the delay for transplanted rice july roxas et

direct seeding from traditional transplanting in iloilo province philippines dryseeded lowland rice establishment of dry seeded rice in lowland fields must be in accord with the local rainfall pattern field observations suggest that dry seeding after rains commence results in poor seedling emergence and low yields dry seeding ahead of the rainy season requires consideration of rainfall pattern and the effects of early rainfall on crop performance for high yields once rainfall begins it must be adequate to promote fast seed emergence and rapid early vegetative growth despite the above difficulties in stand establishment dry seeding into dry soil provides a unique opportunity to increase cropping intensity by double cropping for many years farmers in northeastern india bangladesh and indonesia have grown rainfed lowland rice by dry seeding directly onto nonpuddled soil at the beginning of the rainy season this method of rice culture is known as uuscropping in northeastern india and bangladesh the aus meaning early rice is direct seeded in march april and harvested in julyaugust gogorantja also known as gogorancah is a system used in certain areas in indonesia that practice rainfed rice culture as early as 1928 the gogorantja method had been used successfully in indonesia in a multiple cropping system dalrymple 1971 under this system land is prepared during the dry season and planted at the beginning of the rainy season in october november in this system rice grows as a dryland crop for the first few weeks and becomes a wetland crop as soon as rainfall is adequate to flood the field in several regions farmers grow a transplanted rice crop after the gogoruntju rice in flood prone areas on the north coast of java prolonged heavy rains cause frequent floods by using the gogorantja method flood damage is minimal because with direct dry seeding rice plants are 8090 days old and 8090 cm tall when floods occur there are disadvantages with the gogoruntju system land preparation is difficult rainfall is uncertain during the stages of land preparation and stand establishment and weed competition is severe in most rice growing areas in the philippines rains start at the beginning of may but not enough water accumulates for puddling the field until july or august irri scientists in 19741976 field tests demonstrated that a first crop of an early maturing rice can be started in may by seeding into dry soil at the onset of the monsoon but before the heavy rains start those early planted rices are harvested in mid august the soils puddled and a second crop is transplanted seedbeds are seeded 3 weeks before the harvest of the first crop with this system transplanting of the second crop may come at the time of transplanting of the first crop under the traditional system fig 78 in an irri study at nine sites in central luzon philippines farmers were harvesting their second crop transplanted at the same time that local

the interval between harvesting of one crop and planting of the next in a cropping sequence is important in all twocrop rainfed cultures in fact delay in turnaround time is a serious impediment to intensification in a rainfed ricebased cropping system long turnaround time results in crops being planted too late in the wet season for dependable production presently the rainfed ricerice

a great deal under different systems of rice culture among all the cultural practices for irrigated systems such as fertilizer management weed control and insect control with insecticides are far more efficient than those for rainfed systems modern varieties with semidwarf growth characteristics have done best in irrigated rice culture the basic ir8 plant type with a maturity period of 100 125 days is most appropriate in order to increase cropping intensity and productivity per hectare per day even shorter maturity varieties are desirable direct seeding onto puddled soils direct seeding onto puddled soil is practiced in parts of india bangladesh sri lanka and the philippines for direct seeding on puddled soils the land is leveled after the soil is puddled and pregerminated seeds are either broadcast or machine drilled with ideal conditions it is possible to obtain similar high grain yields with rice transplanted or direct seeded in puddled soil to obtain high yields with direct seeded rices precise water management water depths controlled with irrigation and drainage good weed control and optimum fertilizer manage ment are necessary root anchorage is poor and lodging is more serious with direct seeded than with transplanted rice castillo 1962 242 systems of rice culture varietal requirement varieties suitable for direct seeding rainfed rice onto puddled soil are also suitable for irrigated rice culture drill seeding into dry soil drill seeding rice into dry soil is most common in the united states and australia where rice production is fully mechanized under this system the final land preparation is done with a spring tooth or disc harrow followed by a spike tooth harrow this generates a mellow firm seedbed and moisture is held near the soil surface for rapid germination johnston and miller 1973 rice is sown 3 5 cm deep with a grain drill in australia rice is grown once in 34 years in rotation with other crops the rice crop is often seeded into heavily grazed pasture land without preparing the field in a method called sod seeding because of extremely high solar radiation and long days during the reproductive and ripening stages and very few insect and disease problems extremely high yields have been reported from sod seeded rice varietal requirement for rice drilled into dry soil both short 100 cm tall and intermediate 130 cm tall statured rices are grown in australia inter mediate statured japonicas some from california are widely grown in the southern united states where drill seeding is common the indica japonica crosses with intermediate grain type are grown broadcast seeding onto dry or moist soils broadcast seeding onto dry or moist soil is usually by aircraft and the seeds are covered by harrowing simmons 1940 reported the method popular in arkansas because it did not require much machinery it was used extensively in new rice growing areas however more seeds are required and stand establish ment is poorer than with drill seeding in texas rice frequently is broadcast on rough dry seedbeds with an end gate seeder varietal requirement there is no difference between varieties for broad cast and drill seeding however because of a possible severe lodging problem a broadcast seeded rice should have a stiff straw water seeded rice the practice of water seeding rice originated and is still followed in parts of asia including india sri lanka malaysia and thailand it is widely practiced in the americas southern europe russia and australia for water seeding precise water control is a must and more seeds are required than for the transplant method good seed viability is essential oxygen deficiency does not appear to be a limiting factor in stand establishment of rice in water seeded rice chapman and mikkelsen 1963 deepwater rice culture 243 in california water seeded rice is the major system of rice culture the system was started in california primarily to control barnyard grass echinochloa spp the usual practice in california is to soak the seed for 18 24 hours drain for 2448 hours and seed by airplane into fields flooded to a depth of 75 15 cm aircraft seeding into water in california was initiated in 1929 johnston and miller 1973 on clay soils in arkansas a disc harrow is used to prepare the seedbed a spring tooth harrow follows the disc harrow to leave furrows in the seedbed to catch the seed and reduce the drift the field is then flooded as rapidly as possible to a minimum 1015 cm depth the field is seeded immediately after flooding at the rate of 150 kgha the 1015cm water level is maintained for 46 weekshall 1960 similar water seeding techniques have been developed for texas and louisiana johnston and miller 1973 varietal requirement a high level of lodging resistance is important for rice varieties water seeded otherwise lodging causes considerable reduction in rice yields and quality it is also difficult to use a combine harvester in lodged fields recently several rices were developed in california with reduced height from 130 cm to about 100 cm examples are the intermediate statured calrose medium grain and s 6 short grain and the short statured m 7 and m 9 medium grain they are most popular in water seeded rice in california see chapter 6 the shorter rices have better lodging resistance than the taller ones grown earlier the shorter rices now cover at least 50 of the rice growing areas in california deepwater rice culture deepwater rice is a general term used for rice culture or the variety that is planted when the standing water for a certain period of time is more than 50 cm water depths problems varietal requirement and cultural practices are somewhat unique for deepwater rice growing areas which are in a continuum from the medium deep rainfed lowland rice culture for deepwater rice maximum water depths vary between 51 and 100 cm for more than half of the growth duration and sometimes there is complete submergence of the plant the depth of water duration of flooding the rate of increase in water level temperature turbidity and time of occurrence vary for different areas so that the term deepwater may have different meanings in different countries figure 710 shows the duration depth and daily increase or decrease in water level in the huntra area of thailand where deepwater and some floating rices are grown as in the huntra area water usually remains on the field in all deepwater rice areas for four months or longer the lowlying areas so called stagnant water areas and the tidal swamp areas are of this nature uncontrolled water regimes and deepwater rice and floating rice are found in deltas estuaries and river valleys 244 systems of rice culture figure 710 changes in water depth during the 1969 rice

floods table 76 problems of deepwater rice culture the main problems of deepwater rice growers are drought damage at germination and the seedling stage because the crop is weed competition at the

of time are not included in this table 245 246 systems of rice culture submergence of rices at various growth stages lodging susceptibility these problems are discussed in details by vergara 1977b varietal requirements in the deepwater rice growing areas only intermediate statured about 130 cm mostly traditional varieties are grown a few modern varieties are grown but for the deepwater area those varieties must have excellent submergence tolerance and in some cases moderate elongation ability there are many common plant characteristics needed in the different deepwater areas as well as many differences in plant type when considering a particular area vergara 1977c listed six plant characters desirable for deepwater rice 1 good seedling vigor is essential 2 essentially a plant type of the high yielding varieties is needed with the ability to elongate if the water level increases rapid elongation is not necessary 3 intermediate plant height about 130 cm tall at 5 cm water depth is needed in fact if water level is low or drought sets in the plant height will be about 100 cm 4 submergence tolerance is necessary 5 kneeing ability is required in case elongation takes place and the plants lodge when the water recedes 6 photoperiod sensitivity should assure flowering at a time when plants are least vulnerable to submergence in some areas 150 day varieties which are photoperiod insensitive are adequate but in some areas maturity may take up to 240 days figure 711 shows an example of growth stages of deepwater rice varieties in west bengal india cultural practices dry seeding of deepwater rice is fairly common although transplanting or double transplanting is occasionally practiced in bangladesh sowing usually starts in mid march but the advent of rains and amount of rainfalldetermine the actual date of sowing in west bengal india seed is broadcast in aprilmay on dry soil in thailand deepwater rice is grown as a dryland crop until the full force of the monsoon sets in which is any time from june to august before the onset of the monsoon rice frequently suffers from severe drought in vietnam reseeding of deepwater rice is often done once or twice if it does not rain for several days after seeding de datta and otoole 1977 however floating rice culture 247 figure 711 diagrammatic representation of the relative lengths of various growth phases and subphases of rice plants in deep water from datta and banerji 1979 farmers double transplant the rice crop in parts of the mekong delta of vietnam where the water level ranges from 40 to 70 cm during the wet season farmers sow the seedbeds in june at the onset of the rainy season and pull the seedlings 30 days later to transplant them in bigger seedbeds where they grow for another 60 days they transplant the seedlings a second time in september when the water level is as deep as 70 cm little fertilizer or pesticide is applied to deepwater rice weeds are controlled primarily by harrowing following germination of rice and weeds flooding at 5060 days after seeding provides reinfestation of some weeds mostly of the aquatic type cropping patterns of deepwater rice growing areas vary from country to country for example in bangladesh deepwater rice and floating rice is generally grown following an aus early summer rainfed rice or boro irrigated winter rice crop fig 712 other crops particularly rabi are grown in rotation with deepwater rice floating rice culture water depth problems and varietal requirements are generally similar for floating and deepwater rice culture except that the development of modern varieties and their technology is considerably more difficult for floating rice floating rice is grown where maximum water depth ranges between 1 and 6 m for more than half of the growth duration in densely populated areas floating rice is grown as a subsistence crop because no other crop will grow these areas cover the floodplains of the ganges and brahmaputra in india and bangladesh the 248 systems of rice culture figure 712 cropping patterns in deepwater ricegrowing areas in bangladesh aus is an early summer rainfed rice rabi is an irrigated winter crop and

floating rices are grown in the floodplains of the sokotorima valley in mali floating rice is grown on the plains where the niger river and its tributaries cause annual flooding martin 1974 of about 223000 ha of rice land in mali about 70 grows floating rice this is one of the largest floating ricegrowing areas in west africa toure 1979 in west bengal india there are about 20000 ha of lowlying areas where water accumulates slowly but steadily from adjoining flood areas during the monsoonal season juneseptember and increases water depths to 3 m mukherji 1975 in bangladesh it is estimated that 2 million hectares where maximum water depths vary from 1 to 6 m grow rice the part of those areas that grow floating rice would be difficult to estimate the length of time that floodwater remains on the field varies from place to place and from year to year in the same area in floating ricegrowing areas the duration is 36 months in bangladesh 4 months in thailand 34 months in india 8 months in mali and 10 months in niger vergara et al 1976 floating rice culture 249 problems of floating rice culture the problems of growing floating rice are similar to those described for deepwater rice except they become more severe in floating rice growing areas duration of submergence turbidity of water and temperature of water all affect the floating rice crop varietal requirements floating rice varieties have been reported to increase in plant height by as much as 2025 cm a day in bangladesh the daily increase in plant height may be as much as 6090 cm chowdhury and zaman 1970 the average increase in water rise is 38 cmday in thailand the average increase in west africa is 310 cm day although it may reach 50 cmday bidaux 1971 floating rice plants have been reported to elongate as much as 6 m the critical plant characters associated with floating rice culture are listed by vergara et al 1976 they are they must withstand an abrupt rise in water level or total submergence for at they should have the ability to grow quickly above the water level the varieties must have tillering ability before and possibly during the flood they must withstand uprooting otherwise severe winds can result in varieties must be photoperiod sensitive and mature between 150 and 270 least 1 3 weeks without losing physiological stability enormous waves that uproot and carry the plants great distances days from these criteria it is obvious that no modern varieties semidwarf or intermediate statured can be grown as floating rice for example the entire floating rice growing area in india grows photoperiod sensitive local varieties table 77 for a long time to come farmers in the floating rice growing areas may need to use local varieties that are suited to the specific water and flood regime cultural practices the ungerminated rice seeds for floating rice are normally broadcast 60130 kgha on dry soil before the advent of the rainy season the seeds germinate as soon as rains thoroughly soak the soil in certain areas pregerminated seeds are broadcast on puddled soil the seedlings grow as a dryland crop or at most in moist soil conditions for 420 weeks before flooding occurs drought damage and weed competition are often limiting factors in getting an optimum stand of rice as the floodwater rises rice plants may elongate as much as 6 m forming a table 77 lowland

meanings in different countries upland rice dryland rice refers to rice grown on both level and sloping fields that are not bunded that are prepared and seeded under dry conditions and that depend on rainfall for moisture de datta 1975 recently moormann and van breemen 1978 referred to upland rice land as pluvial rice land see chapter 3 it is also known as arroz secano in most of latin america and arroz sequeiro in brazil upland rice growing areas upland rice is grown in asia africa and latin america mostly by small subsistence farmers in the poorest regions of the world but the area planted to upland rice is nearly 10 of the worlds total rice land of nearly 1435 million hectaresabout 14 million hectares much of the future expansion of the worlds rice land will probably be in upland rice growing areas because most of the land suited to lowland rainfed or irrigated rice culture is already planted to lowland rice such expansion has tremendous possibility in africa and in the cerrado savanna area in central western brazil and the amazon basin area of south america but in asia the entire tillable land suitable for upland rice culture has already been brought into production and some steep mountainous areas that should not be tilled are being used for upland rice and other crops an exception in asia is the vast area in southern parts of sumatra and kalimantan indonesia that could be brought into upland rice culture if difficult weeds such as nutsedge cyperus rotundus l and cogon grass or alang alang imperata cylindrica l beauv were controlled see chapter 12 upland rice is grown under a wide range of management intensities which vary from shifting cultivation as practiced in malaysia philippines west africa and peru to a highly mechanized crop as practiced in brazil upland rice is an important system of rice culture in south and southeast asia covering 10 of the total rice area fig 72 the largest areas of upland rice in asia are in india bangladesh indonesia

performs and yields as well as lowland rice anywhere in the world the problems of upland rice all factors that limit the grain yield of lowland rice also limit the yield of upland rice but some are more critical in the production of upland rice de datta and beachell 1972 they are rainfall distribution the amount and variability of rainfall are two important constraints on production of upland rice see chapter 2 change in nutrients in soil the forms and availability of nutrients are directly related to moisture supply in soil these changes in nutrients under low moisture supply have profound effects on nutrition and growth of upland rice among the growth limiting factors in oxidized aerobic soils are phosphorus deficiency iron deficiency on neutral and alkaline soils and manganese and aluminum toxicity on acid soils fertilized with ammonium sulfate ponnamperuma and castro 1972 weed competition weed competition in upland rice is so serious that total failure of a crop is common if weeds are not controlled see chapter 12 incidence of blast the incidence of rice blast disease is more severe for upland than for lowland rice see chapter 11 varietal requirements many varieties of oryza sativa or o glaberrima grown as upland rice are loosely called upland rice varieties chang and bardenas 1965 most of the traditional varieties grown as upland rice are intermediate statured or tall with relatively long pale green leaves low tillering and long well exserted panicles chang and vergara 1975 because they are tall most upland varieties have weak straw and are susceptible to lodging they are also early maturing 100125 days and have deeper roots than most lowland varieties krupp et al 1972 most upland rice varieties have a fair togood level of drought tolerance and produce stable but low yields of about 1 tha de datta et al 1975 varieties that produce 34 tha as an upland rice crop have the following plant characters semidwarf to intermediate in height 100 125 cm tall medium toheavy tillering 254 systems of rice culture tolerance for and recovery from moderate drought stress resistance to lodging resistance to blast and bacterial leaf blight cultural practices cultural practices for upland rice have been studied far less than those for lowland rice in most of asia little mechanization is used to prepare land for an upland rice crop as soon as enough rain has fallen to permit initial land preparation the field is plowed with animal drawn implements fig 714 and harrowed with a comb harrow to prepare a seedbed and firm the soil in thailand slightly elevated areas are plowed with water buffalo or cattle and then hoed on hills the soil is hardly cultivated indian and bangladeshi farmers simply turn the soil over with country plows and pulverize it no more than 10 cm deep a similar method is used in sri lanka and nepal in west africa 98 of the rice land is prepared by hand but methods vary greatly from country to country under shifting cultivation the soil is hardly tilled at all in most upland rice growing areas in brazil large tractors are used to prepare the land and intercultivate between widely spaced rows fig 715 in most countries upland rice is primarily broadcast however drilling is practiced in some countries de datta and ross 1975 fertilization practices are figure 714 a filipino farmer prepares his land for upland rice with an animal drawn wooden plow references 255 figure 715 in brazil large tractors are generally used to prepare and intercultivate upland rice lands the same as for any other dryland crop however most upland rice farmers do not use fertilizers if traditional varieties are grown in brazil and central american countries because improved varieties are used upland rice is adequately fertilized fertilizer response is poor in brazil because of low moisture supply from rain and poor water holding capacity of soil in central american countries high yielding modern varieties such as cica 9 are grown as upland rice and have excellent fertilizer response with adequate fertilizer yields of 67 tha are fairly common with cica 9 in costa rica references ahmad m s 1980

germination seedling emergence and stand establishment stages tillage practices that provide conditions for rapid water intake and for temporary storage of water on the soil surface or in the tilled layer help prevent water runoff a soil surface with an uneven microrelief can store considerable water in the microdepressions on the soil surface for later intake into the soil this mechanism has been termed depression storage larson 1963 for rice the kind and degree of land preparation are closely related to the method of planting and moisture availability either from rain or from irrigation the most common benefits of conventional land preparation for most crops are weed control incorporation of fertilizers increase in soil porosity and aeration mixing the soil to bring up leached deposits giving the soil a fine tilth to increase adsorption of nutrients the benefits cited for tillage for rice are not greatly different however because rice is grown in diverse land and water management systems tillage practices for land preparation vary with the systems tillage operations vary according to water availability soil texture topography level of resources available to the farmer and farmers preference for a particular type of rice culture this chapter focuses on land preparation and crop establishment methods for lowland wetland preparation and upland deepwater and rainfed and irrigated direct seeded rice dryland preparation 259 260 land preparation for rice soils land preparation under different systems of rice culture tillage of rice soils as wetland or dryland depends on the stand establishment technique to be followed moisture supply and power resources available to the farmer the most critical factors for the growth and yield of rice are timeliness and quality of land preparation wetland tillage in most tropical asian countries wetland tillage is common the traditional method of tillage for lowland rice is plowing and puddling generally done by animal drawn implements that frequently give poor results puddling has been widely adopted because it provides ease of transplanting wetland tillage in relation to moisture supply water savings during wetland tillage provide expansion of the planted area and minimize drought damage by timely planting of seedlings any advancement of planting dates increases the probability of escape from late season dry spells wetland tillage consists of three phases 1 land soaking in which water is absorbed until the soil is saturated 2 plowing which is the initial breaking and turning over of the soil 3 harrowing during which big clods of soil are broken and puddled with water together the three phases use one third of the total water supply in growing a rice crop transplanting starts at the end of land preparation the puddling process the term puddling has several meanings for farmers it is a simple soil operation that eases transplanting and reduces water losses through percolation in rheological terms the word puddle means a clay that can be worked to a water impermeable stage rice 1943 bodman and rubin 1948 defined puddling as the mechanical reduction in the apparent specific volume of soil only soils with more than 20 of clay particles are prone to puddling puddling a soil results in the destruction of 91 100 of macropore volume and restricts porosity to only the space occupied by the water film around the clay particles investigations of bodman and rubin 1948 led to the introduction of the term puddlability a factor strongly influenced by the soil moisture and energy status of the solid phase land preparation under different systems of rice culture 261 when clay soils are plowed and harrowed at about soil saturation several changes take place in their structure among the properties of puddled soils cited by koenigs 1963 are the marked reduction in airfilled pore volume lowering of permeability increase in moisture suction lowering of resistance to raindrops and increase in deformability according to jamison 1953 the increase in microporosity by puddling causes an increase in the socalled waterholding capacity of the puddled soil puddling and subsequent flooding differentiate lowland rice soils chemically and pedologically from other arable soils an important difference between a dryland and a puddled lowland soil is the presence of the reduced soil layer in the puddled soil system the puddled layer is divided into several subhorizons the formation of relatively impermeable layers or plow pans is attributed to physical compaction at the same depth during puddling and to eluviation of clays and reduced iron and manganese the plow pan is found in loamy soils that have grown rice for many years and in welldrained latosols but is absent in clayey soils vertisols young alluvial and calcareous soils moormann and dudal 1964 the rate of moisture loss tillage practices wetting and drying cycles and temperature all influence the degree and rate of soil compaction and the formation of plow pans the degree of compaction however is influenced by groundwater table and soil type high bulk density of the soil below the plow layer after wet tillage results in less downward flow of water and less leaching of nutrients advantages of puddling although puddling as practiced in much of tropical asia involves a great amount of labor the method has been widely adopted primarily because of its compatibility with other components of production technology and economic conditions which include improved weed control by primary and secondary tillage through puddling ease of transplanting establishment of a reduced soil condition which improves soil fertility and fertilizer management reduced draft requirements for primary and secondary tillage reduced percolation losses resulting in conservation of water from rainfall action and irrigation completed de datta et al 1978 reliability of monsoon rains by the time puddling operations have been moisture conservation one important benefit of puddling is the apparent reduction of moisture losses by percolation it is difficult however to accurately 262 land preparation for rice soils figure 81 cumulative water losses through percolation and evaporation measured in puddled and granulated soils in steel drums adapted from sanchez 1973b determine the difference in moisture losses from puddled and undisturbed soils also puddling reduces hydraulic conductivity of soil sanchez 1973b pointed out a dramatic difference in percolation losses between puddled and granulated soils fig 81 granulated soils lost 30 of the water by percolation and 70 by evaporation in 7 days the puddled soils lost 10 by percolation and 90 by evaporation during the trial soil moisture depletion patterns indicate that after the initial heavier loss of water in granulated soils the trend of subsequent loss was essentially the same for all soils with granular soils averaging 20 lower moisture contents than puddled soils de datta and kerim 1974 reported that percolation wasconsiderably higher in a nonpuddled soil than in a puddled soil fig 82 the nonpuddled soil received twice as much water and had three times as much seepage and percolation loss as the puddled soil similar results were reported by huynh et al 1974 who reported water requirements including evapotranspiration of 45 mm day for puddled and 60 mmday for nonpuddled soils at saturation no standing water for the same soils flooded to 5 cm the requirements were 79 and 81 mm day puddling reduces percolation losses of moisture by decreasing aggregate cohesion thereby essentially eliminating macroporosity and increasing bulk density wickham and singh 1978 land preparation under different systems of rice culture 263 figure 82 comparison of cumulative water applied evapotranspiration and perco lation losses in field studies of puddled and nonpuddled soils continually flooded at 5 cm irri 1972 wet season adapted from de datta and kerim 1974 in a field lysimeter rice on an alfisol underwent a 2 week drought during panicle development soil moisture tension rose to 55 centibars cb at 20 cm in the nonpuddled soil and to 25 cb in the puddled soil fig 83 furthermore soil moisture content remains higher after wetland tillage than after dryland tillage fig 84 this indicates that rice grown on puddled soil may be less affected by drought because moisture retention is higher than in nonpuddled soil weed control land preparation for puddling of a lowland rice soil consists of plowing and harrowing which minimize weed growth some farmers in south and southeast asia repeat plowing and harrowing several times to reduce weed problems puddling aids the quick establishment and tillering of transplanted rice and results in greater competition and suppression of weed growth in addition transplanters trample weeds to incorporate them into the soil during the transplanting operation this explains the generally lower weed problem in transplanted rice than in broadcast seeded flooded rice land preparation includes two main weed control operations plowing a deep tillage between harvest of one crop and planting of the next crop which turns under weed seed and rice stubble harrowing a shallow tillage and puddling before rice seedlings are transplanted further incorporates weed seed and stubble into the reduced soil layer where lack of oxygen inhibits weed seed germination functions of primary and secondary tillage are schematically represented in fig 85 figure 83 soil moisture tension at 20cm depth in puddled and nonpuddled rainfed soils irri 1972 wet season adapted from de datta and kerim 1974 figure 84 soil moisture content

wetland rice field preparation time in discussing groups of tillage operations in relation to various functions kuipers 1974 suggested weed control as a main objective of each tillage operation the number of weeds growing in association with transplanted rice declines as the number of preplanting harrowings increases fig 86 the time between harrowings and the number of harrowings can be reduced sub stantially if postplanting weed control is practiced where chemical control is not practicedtillage is the most important factor in weed control in transplanted rice minimizing weed growth is more critical for direct seeded rice than for transplanted rice because direct seeded rice does not get as much of a head start on weeds the effect of level of land preparation on the number of weeds in transplanted and direct seeded rice is shown in fig 87 nonselective herbicides applied with or without follow up tillage suppressed all weeds present at the time of land preparation but weeds regrew the rate and intensity of weed regrowth were higher in herbicide treated plots than the plots that were plowed and harrowed direct seeded rice had a higher weed count per unit area than transplanted rice with either zero or minimum tillage tillage alone is probably the most practical method for controlling some perennial grass weeds such as paspalum distichum l depth of plowing also affects growth of annual and perennial weeds land preparation alone however will not control all the annual and perennial weeds nutrient availability the low redox potential of submerged puddled soils helps

from de datta and barker 1978 phosphorus and silicon and the solubility of iron and manganese increase puddling also hastens the mineralization of soil organic matter significant increases in nh 4 n production after 4 weeks of anaerobic incubation were observed in puddled soil samples by harada et al 1964 data from sanchez 1973a indicate that puddling decreased losses of applied nitrogen in the field and resulted in higher rice yields when nutrient availability is evaluated in puddled soils mud forms are best table 81 disadvantages of puddling strong arguments have been presented for replacement of soil puddling for rice cultivation with furrow irrigation on a nonpuddled soil a nonpuddled soil allows easier inclusion of other crops into a ricebased cropping system the main disadvantages of puddling are high water requirement hindrance to regeneration of soil structure and impeded root development figure 87 effects of levels of land preparation on number of surviving

a major disadvantage of puddling is the high water requirement for land preparation water required for puddling a wetland field varies from 150 to 200 mm see chapter 9 total water useina nonpuddled field is about 50 of that in a wetland field despite a longer field duration of a nonpuddled planting in a philippine study daily water use in a wetland field was 928 mmday including water required for land preparation compared with 337 mmday in a nonpuddled field de datta et al 1973 the high water requirement for land preparation in a puddled system is a more critical disadvantage for rainfed rice than for irrigated rice farmers often have to wait 1 3 months for sufficient water to allow puddling because of insufficient water land preparation by rainfed rice farmers is delayed at a period when all other environmental factors are favorable for planting and subsequent crop growth this disadvantage has led some farmers in bangladesh northeastern india indonesia and the philippines to shift to dry seeding of rice in a nonpuddled soil hindrance to regeneration of soil structure in some parts of tropical asia cropping can be intensified by extending the total cropgrowing season this is made possible by regeneration of soil structure which permits growing an upland crop following lowland rice this is not a new concept but the shift from a lowland puddled soil to a dryland soil requires major alteration in the physics of the soils the conversion of a soil from the wet to dry condition is characterized by a process of improving the soil structure destroyed by puddling the wet to dry conversion becomes a great concern in a ricebased cropping system on a clay soil when a puddled soil dries it may shrink and crack resulting in clumps that are frequently unworkable and create difficulties in preparing the soil for upland crops regeneration of soil structure is a major consideration in the conversion of soils from lowland paddy to a dryland field briones 1977 concluded that montmorillonitic clay soils with low organic matter and iron oxide contents are more difficult to convert from lowland to dryland use than kaolinitic clay with higher organic matter and iron oxide contents this indicates that incorporation of crop residues aids regeneration of soil structure a lowland soil is best converted to a dryland soil by tillage at an optimum moisture content the simplest process is to let the lowland soil dry before tillage to a moisture content below the lower limit of plasticity for easier tillage in the wet to dry soil conversion the soil should be worked before the maximum soil strength has developed impediment to root development puddling creates an unfavorable rooting medium for upland crops and puddling and subsequent continuous sub mergence cause several nutritional disorders of rice in tropical asia further more in the puddled anaerobic soil decomposition of organic matter slows which leads to the accumulation of toxic organic compounds low grain yields from puddled soils are often due to accumulation of fe 2 and h 2 s especially on acid sulfate soils land preparation under different systems of rice culture 269 the formation of a hardpan by puddling some heavy clay lateritic soils leaves a plow layer too thin to permit adequate root development hardpan formation is also undesirable in saline paddy soils speed of land preparation for simplicity the speed of land preparation is measured by the progress of soaking plowing harrowing and transplanting of a total area in a philippine study valera et al 1975 related the speed or duration of land preparation with the supply of water they did not include light rains 2 or more weeks prior to the release of irrigation water in the computation of cumulative water use for land preparation only hard and cracked soils which were not cropped for at least a month prior to the study were considered water supply was found to be a limiting factor in the duration of land preparation for some sites fifty percent of the whole pearanda river irrigation systems gapan site was transplanted in 75 weeks but an additional 55 weeks were required to finish it fig 88 there was a significant time gap between the first half and the second half of the system the first half was irrigated by the upper reaches of the canal and was completely transplanted in 10 weeks the second half irrigated by the lower reaches of the same canal was not transplanted any earlier than the adjacent rainfed area for sites where water was more generously supplied land preparation time was about 55 weeks fig 88 in the dry season valera et al 1975 collected data from the upper pampanga river project area land preparation time ranged from 75 weeks for 50 of the area to 10 weeks for 100 of the area transplanted table 82 water supplied for land preparation savings of about 100 mm of water lost by evaporation could be achieved by reducing land preparation time to 5 weeks in many areas but shortening of land preparation time will require additional power resources use of tractors for example may speed land preparation operations initial moisture content of the field is another factor that may be relevant in reducing the period of land preparation estimates of the water requirement for saturation and land preparation for a lowland puddled field in malaysia are 505 mm for the wet season and 570 mm for the dry season data collected from a 25 ha site in the philippines showed an average of 723 mm of water required for seepage and percolation land soaking and evaporation during land preparation in the wet season average duration of land preparation was 75 weeks from the time water was first turned in until 50 of the area was transplanted tillage properties of lowland soils tillage should be done within an appropriate soil moisture range because soil consistency changes widely with moisture content there are fairly clear figure 88 percent of area soaked plowed and

constants and the predic tion of machine performance is possible for any soil type and moisture contents with increasing cropping intensity of rice the tillage operation becomes difficult as the trafficability problem of machines arises the relationship between machine performance and soil constants cone index and shear resistance is important knowing the cone index the trafficability of a tractor can be predicted table 83 during rotary tilling the tractor is pushed by the action of the rotary tines and axle torque decreases this pushing action of the rotary tiller contributes to the trafficability of the tractor on soft soils kisu 1978 among the factors cited for low frequency of use of tillage machinery are low soil bearing capacity lack of farm roads cost of machines and lack of mechanical knowledge and adequate machinery service facilities 272 land preparation for rice soils table 83 prediction criteria of trafficability of tractor from cone index a from kisu 1978

high yields of 56 tha are common and farmers often harvest 89 tha in temperate east asia the soil is puddled for rice and the grain yield ranges from 35 to 70 tha in tropical asia where most rice is grown as rainfed it is believed that a puddled field minimizes risk of yield reduction due to drought in an experiment on a montmorillonitic clay irrigated ir20 rice yielded 79 tha in a puddled soil but yielded only 36 tha in a nonpuddled soil the crop on puddled soil produced 90 kg grain mm water and the crop on nonpuddled soil produced 83 kg grainmm water de datta et al 1973 in a subsequent study rice variety tongil in puddled soil had about 25 times higher efficiency of water use 79 kg grainmm water than rice in nonpuddled soil 29 kg grainmm of water de datta and kerim 1974 similar results are reported for sandy soils in india and nigeria in bangladesh increasing the number of plowings from two to three increased grain yield by almost 1 tha further increase in plowing did not increase grain yield sattar 1978 little has been reported on difference in grain yield between animaldrawn and powerdrawn implements from a study at the central rice research institute in india jacobi 1974 reported that yields after tillage with the two and four wheel tractormounted implements were higher than those after tillage by animaldrawn equipment a yield advantage was attributed to primary tillage only in the case of animaldrawn equipment a survey in central luzon philippines indicated that use of tractors in the tillage process gave an advantage in weed control but not in yield de datta and barker 1978 land preparation under different systems of rice culture 273 tillage problems in double cropping of rice to shorten the turnaround time between crops in double cropping of rice mechanization in land preparation is essential its use can shorten the period between harvest of one crop and planting of the next however the between crop tillage operation is difficult because of the trafficability problem the clayey soils of south and southeast asia become hard and compact when dried but when submerged they lose bearing capacity immediately another problem is softening caused by the breakage of the plow sole layer by large machines trafficability problems can be minimized by increasing the period of soil drying between crops but that increases turnaround time softening of the soil can be avoided by not using large machines unless the soil is sufficiently dry to hold heavy equipment dryland tillage the reasons cited for using dryland tillage for rice are initial crop growth is obtained from early monsoonal rainfall which would be used for land soaking and puddling for wetland tillage labor constraints associated with seedbed preparation land preparation and transplanting are reduced large power units can be employed for primary and secondary tillage where capital is available and labor is lacking where a nonrice crop follows a nonpuddled rice crop soil structure is in a more favorable state for stand establishment and root development of the following crop insect and disease buildup on alternate hosts during the period required for wetland soaking and puddling are reduced the major disadvantages of dryland tillage are draft power requirements are high often beyond the reach of rice farmers in early weed control requirements are comparatively exacting and critical percolation losses are comparatively high leaving the crop more susceptible the crop may be exposed to several soil insects and to blast prior to fertilizer requirements will often be higher de datta et al 1978 the asian tropics to periodic drought stress accumulation of standing water many systems of rice culture are based on dryland preparation for example all ricegrowing areas in the united states southern australia most of latin 274 land preparation for rice soils america and west africa parts of tropical asia and many countries in europe use dryland tillage in some of those areas rice is sown in dry soil and later irrigated united states and australia or sown in dry soil and grown as rainfed upland rice most of latin america west africa and parts of asia in the united states the tillage is much the same as that for other small grains in rainfed rice culture the type of tillage done depends on whether the crop will be grown as dryland or wetland land leveling for good water control and also to improve quality of seedbed preparation it is essential to have land leveled by grading in recent years a laser beam has been used to guide grading equipment as it cuts and fills the soil after the cutandfill work a land plane or leveler is used for the finishing touches on a level smooth surface huey 1977 waterseeded rice if the rice is to be sown in water such as it is in california the soil surface before flooding should be left rough which prevents drift of seeds fig 89 in california rice farmers sometimes are able to prepare a good seedbed in the late fall or winter and erect levees when that is possible little land preparation other than harrowing is necessary before spring figure 89 for waterseeded rice such as in california the land should be prepared rough before water is introduced land preparation under different systems of rice culture 275 the final seedbed preparation for water seeding depends on soil type on sandy or silt loam soils a mellow firm seedbed similar to that for drilling should be prepared on clay or very fine silt loam soils the seedbed should be fairly rough with a clod size as large as 10 cm in diameter johnston and miller 1973 drillseeded rice in the southern united states where dryland drill seeding of rice is practiced a mellow firm weed free seedbed is desirable the first step is plowing or disking 10 or 20 cm deep to bury the previous crop residue the land is then leveled and a field cultivator may be used for the final seedbed preparationjust prior to seeding huey 1977 reynolds 1954 reported that summer plowing frequently is practiced in texas for fields infested with red rice oryza sativa l or other weeds after summer plowing the land is leveled and disk harrowed as needed for weed control land plowed in the fall is usually left rough until spring and then disk harrowed preparatory to seeding heavy soils plowed in the spring generally require more subsequent tillage to obtain a desirable seedbed than when plowed in the fall or early winter final land preparation just ahead of drilling is usually done with a spring tooth harrow or a disc harrow with a spike tooth harrow behind it a roller packer may be used to break up clods and to firm the soil after drilling this gives a mellow smooth and firm seedbed and the moisture is held near the surface so that the seed germinates soon after seeding if rice follows a soybean or a similar row crop only a limited amount of land preparation may be necessary if the soil is in fairly good physical condition after the row crop is harvested broadcast seeded rice if rice is to be broadcast seeded on dry ground the final land preparation should leave the surface rough and somewhat cloddy the seed may be covered with a field cultivator spring tooth harrow or other appropriate type of equipment a corrugated roller or cultipacker is used to firm the seedbed after broadcast seeding dryseeded bunded rice in asia dryland tillage has been adopted over a limited area for lowland rice production in tropical asia however recent technological advances may increase the area where dryland cultivation is suitable the most difficult problem in dryland tillage systems see chapter 7 is quick tillage of a dry field in bulacan philippines it was observed that where land was prepared at the end of the previous wet season the following wet seasons newly emerged rice crop was able to survive a period of drought in contrast a crop 276 land preparation for rice soils seeded at the same time but following land preparation at the beginning of a current wet season suffered from considerable moisture stress crop survival was apparently due to availability of soil moisture conserved by a soil mulch in the dry season bolton and de datta 1979 tested the conservation of soil moisture by soil mulching they also compared the time saved by the early dry seeding of a rice crop after the dry soil mulch versus transplanting a crop after traditional wetland tillage in plots where land preparation was completed at the end of the previous wet season a dry soil mulch was maintained from february to the first week of may the soil moisture tension under the mulch did not exceed 33 cb at 15cm depth in contrast the soil moisture tension in weedy fallowed plots was 5 bat adepth of 15 cm at the end of the dry season despite a water table within 1 m of the soil surface during the whole period weedfree plots conserved some moisture but not as much as the dry soil mulch fig 810 it is obvious that the dry soil mulch has potential as a practice to conserve soil moisture for early directseeded rice upland rice in most of asia little mechanization is used to prepare land for upland rice as soon as enough rain has fallen to permit initial tillage the field is plowed with an animaldrawn implement then harrowed with an indigenous comb harrow sometimes the weed seeds are allowed to germinate for a week and the field reharrowed for upland rice in thailand slightly elevated areas are plowed by water buffalo or cattle and then hand hoed on hill areas the soil is hardly cultivated indonesian farmers generally prepare land for upland rice with animaldrawn plows during juneaugust indian farmers use simple country plows and pulverize the soil no more than 10 cm deep about 98 of upland rice land in west africa is tilled manually because draft animals are scarce land preparation methods vary greatly from country to country in latin america in the shifting cultivation areas of peru for example mature secondary forests are cut and burned during the dry months upland rice is then seeded by dibbling shifting cultivation in peru is quite similar to the slashandburn methods that precede rice planting in burma malaysia and thailand most upland rice farmers in brazil use large tractors to prepare the land deepwater and floating rice about 15 of the worlds rice lands are subject to annual floods and require deepwater and floating rice cultures see fig 71 in chapter 7 for those cultures tillage and seeding are in dry soils land preparation is poor and drought and weed infestation are major factors affecting seedling establishment figure 810 soil moisture tension under a dry soil mulch did not exceed 33 cb at any time during the 1976 dry season some moisture was conserved by keeping the plots weed free but moisture tension went higher than in the soil mulched plots plots that were fallow and on which weeds were allowed to grow had 5 b of soil moisture tension at a 15 cm depth by the end of the dry season irri 1976 adapted from bolton and de datta 1979 277 278 land preparation for rice soils in bangladesh land preparation for deepwater rice begins in march or april for normal seeding as many as four plowings are common after the plowings the land is leveled by breaking the clods in areas where the soil is a heavy clay big clods remaining after leveling are broken with a long handled wooden mallet in some areas rice is broadcast after the four plowings and the land is leveled primarily to cover the seeds if a farmer feels uncertain about the onset of the monsoon he repeatedly plows the field primarily to dry the soil with such tillage seeds germinate only after the onset of the monsoon in the deepwater rice growing areas in west bengal india rice is broadcast in april or may after the land is plowed dry land preparation and seedling establishment are often poor in thailand the cropping season starts in april when farmers burn straw from the previous crop after that large tractors are hired to disc plow the land when it is slightly moist most farmers with 47 ha hire tractors with a fivedisc plow smaller farmers generally wait until sufficient rain has fallen and use animal drawn implements rice is sown on the plowed land several weeks after the first plowing and the land is plowed again the last plowing destroys new growth of weeds and covers the rice seeds some farmers sow rice in poorly prepared fields and the crop has to compete with growing weeds de datta and otoole 1977 effect of tillage on dryland soil the use of machinery for tillage will become more common for upland than for lowland rice fields in tropical asia this is because much of the machinery used for upland crop tillage can be successfully used for upland rice for the dryland soil aggregate size moisture content porosity and aeration compaction and soil temperature are important tillage related parameters that affect crop yields soil aggregates tillage leaves the soil in an aggregated and loose conditionthereby improving soil structure incorporation of organic matter further improves soil aggregation soil moisture tillage breaks the capillary connection with the soil surface which reduces evaporation of soil moisture excessive tillage reduces infiltrability of soil moisture soil porosity and aeration tillage alters soil structure by increasing its porosity and aeration when a bulk of the soil has large aggregate size more water is retained because of greater internal porosity soil compaction despite the favorable effects of tillage it has detrimental effects over longer periods because of compaction repeated running over the field with heavy equipment may result in a compacted high bulkdensity traffic pan soil temperature tillage creates a soil temperature favorable for seedling establishment tillage loosens the soil surface resulting in the decrease in land preparation under different systems of rice culture 279 thermal conductivity and heat capacity this increases thermal insulation and resistance to water flow from moist soil layers to the atmosphere effect of soil physical properties on pulverization in the case of direct seeding of rice in dry soil seed germination and seedling growth are greatly affected by the fineness of the soil clods the degree of soil pulverization by tillage differs according to soil conditions such as moisture content or particle distribution kisu 1978 plowing dry soils with a hard consistency will result in the formation of numerous clods however plowing in the correct moisture range not only achieves maximum granulation but also requires less power grain yield response to dryland tillage practices with the advent of modern shortduration rices the possibility of increasing rice production by growing two rice crops in rainfed fields becomes viable in regions receiving rainfall for 57 months or more of at least 200 mm rain per month early

sufficient water had accumulated in late july to allow puddling for most farmers of tropical asia mechanical drilling is not a foreseeable alternative for the first crop of dry seeded rice common establishment alternatives are broadcasting on a level field broadcasting over shallow furrows and passing a spike toothed harrow at hand drilling placing seeds in shallow furrows opened by animaldrawn dibbling seeds so that seedlings emerge in hills at uniform spacings 45 to concentrate seed in rows implement analysis of rainfall data indicates that a dry seeded rice crop in two field experiments in the philippines had completed 30 50 days of growth before 400 mm of rainfall enough to puddle soil and transplant had accumulated de datta et al 1978 dry seeding results in net time savings from the first crop that were passed on for growing the second crop similar advantages attributable to dry seeding establishment of the first crop were obtained in a study at irri by delaying to transplant the first crop on a puddled soil insufficient time remained to plant a second crop within the wet season transplanting of a second crop instead of direct seeding may reduce its field duration by 2 3 weeks and lower the risk of late season drought stress during the critical spikelet filling period evidence of this effect appears in table 84 in the form of higher yields and lower variability associated with transplanted second crop in comparison with direct seeded second crops in those studies the number of crop failures following direct seeding was about twice the frequency of failure after transplanting de datta et al 1978 in a study of dry season shallow and deep tillage with straw incorporation rice could be seeded 24 days earlier than the weedy fallow treatmenta practice generally followed by most farmers in tropical asia de datta et al 1978 the land preparation for a transplanted rice crop on puddled soil could start inearly july after sufficient rain accumulated for thorough puddling that gave harvest dates of the transplanted cultivars that were 5 8 weeks later than harvest dates of the same cultivar planted by a dry seeding tillage system thus it was possible to grow only a single crop of transplanted rice on puddled soil but in dry seeded plots a second crop of transplanted rice was harvested table 85 again for reasons cited earlier grain

preparation cost without sacrificing grain yields farmers should limit tillage to a minimum they should select the lowest cost technique of soil tillage and replace that with lower cost operations as soon as they are available one should therefore evaluate total operating costs of the farm and see how cost may be reduced by adopting a special tillage operation moens 1963 divided land preparation practices for rice into three broad groups 1 preparative functionstillage to save inputs like water seeds and plant 2 substitutive functionssubstitution of one operation for another for 3 curative functionsdifficulties encountered by one tillage operation that nutrients example a chemical for a tillage operation are corrected by a more extensive tillage to integrate all tillage operations it is essential to examine each in relation to total effort if tillage aims to avoid damage to soil structure then one should avoid the least essential tillage but if tillage aims to prevent weed seeds from germination it should be limited to that objective and integrated with herbicides blake 1963 minimum and zero tillage the search for substitutive functions of tillage operations has led to minimum and zero tillage practices the modern concept of minimum tillage dates back to the early 1950s with the introduction of the use of dalapon 22dichloropropionic acid to kill an existing grass cover prior to surface reseeding unfortunately the effectiveness of the early herbicides varied with the composition of the weed flora those chemicals also left considerable residue in the soil the discovery of paraquat 11 dimethyl 44bipyridylium ion and recently glyphosate n phosphono methylglycine stimulated considerable interest in reduced tillage techniques due to their broad spectrum activity and lack of toxic residues in the tropics heavy rains destroy the structure of soil exposed by tillage thus reducing infiltration and leaving the soil susceptible to erosion minimum disturbance of soil under such conditions is desirable as information from research on minimum and zero tillage in temperate regions has accumulated the possibilities for research on minimum and zero tillage techniques in tropical crops have grown seth et al 1971 demonstrated in several regions of asia that extensive tillage in rice may not be necessary if weeds are effectively controlled with preplant new tillage concepts and practices 283 herbicides and that yields could equal those following the use of traditional tillage tests in malaysia have demonstrated the feasibility of using minimum cultivation techniques in several different rice crop cultures trials in sri lanka have also shown that both direct seeded and transplanted rice can be established with minimum tillage mittra and pieris 1968 similar benefits were also suggested by mabbayad and buencosa 1967 from the philippines minimum and zero tillage techniques in rice involve the application of nonresidual broad spectrum preplant herbicides to control weeds and ratoon and volunteer rice fields are then flooded and a shallow cultivation and leveling are done in the case of minimum tillage followed by seeding or transplanting the choice of herbicide and the amount used is determined by the degree of infestation and kinds of weeds often a contact herbicide such as paraquat is adequate if most weeds are annual and weed density is light when the density of broadleaf weeds and sedges is heavy a follow up application with mcpa 4 chloro 2methylphenoxy acetic acid or 24 d 24 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid may be desirable where annual grasses or perennial weed species predominate a translocated herbicide such as dalapon or dalapon followed by a contact herbicide such as paraquat gives better result aspects of the minimum and zero tillage techniques that have only been lightly touched on are the relative roles of the preplant herbicides tillage and flooding these three processes are complementary in obtaining good preplant weed control and to a limited extent compensatory for example if tillage is poor or hurried this can be compensated for by extending the period of flooding from 3 to 7 days this poses the question as to how the limited resources available to the rice farmer can be most effectively allocated which will depend on the relative costs and availability of preplant herbicides power for cultivation and water for irrigation de datta and barker 1978 experimental results on minimum and zero tillage techniques in rice a study by mittra and pieris 1968 in sri lanka showed that paraquat application followed by flooding and cultivation provided good weed control table 86 with no adverse effect on yield seth et al 1971 also found no difference in yield in comparing conventional tillage to minimum and zero tillage techniques in lowland rice where paraquat was used for preplant weed control control mabbayad et al 1968 demonstrated that yield panicle number and percentage of sterile spikelets were not significantly different from soil prepared by zero minimum and conventional tillage on a fertile and deep soil in the philippines tillage was shown to be unnecessary when rice was transplanted in land that had been sprayed with paraquat and pentachlorophenol in those experiments a problem sometimes encountered in obtaining good stand establishment in dense weed growth was the failure to get firm contact between 284 land preparation for rice soils table 86 effect of herbicide application and method of land preparation and flooding on weeds growing in association with

generally fewer following the use of minimum tillage however where perennial weeds were present continued practice of zero tillage resulted in rapid regeneration and an increased incidence of these weeds in the same trials weed incidence after planting was markedly reduced when a mixture of mcpa and paraquat was applied for preplant weed control new tillage concepts and practices 285 time saving in terms of time savings with minimum tillage moomaw et al 1968 reported reduction of weeding labor by 200 hours ha compared with conventional tillage in indonesia varley 1970 noted that minimum tillage could reduce the time taken to prepare the land from 1530 days to 510 days when the preplant herbicide application was made before harvest of the previous crop the time was reduced to as little as 24 days even with tillage time reduced from 25 days to 8 days there was about 15 increase in return per unit area per day with continuous cropped rice in trials in sri lanka by mittra and pieris 1968 three rice crops were grown in the shortest possible time using conventional and minimum tillage with minimum tillage the interval between harvesting and transplanting the next crop was reduced to only 10 days and production per unit area per day was increased by 2230 water saving minimum tillage by reducing the time needed for land preparation also reduces the amount of water used with the usual wetland preparation time of 2030 days 30 of the total water needed for a crop of transplanted rice is used during land preparation a saving of at least 20 of the total is possible by using minimum or zero tillage fertilizer management at irri fertilizer management practices were studied for conventional minimum and zero tillage nitrogen fertilizer ef ficiency as measured by increase in grain yield was considerably lower with zero tillage than with minimum and conventional tillage however the grain yield difference between minimum and zero tillage was not significant

weeds de datta et al 1979 recent irri studies indicate that minimum tillage is a dependable alternative to conventional tillage for trans planted rice at least where difficult tocontrol weeds are absent zero tillage should however be considered as a special technique for special conditions de datta et al 1979 sodseeding of rice the extreme example of zero tillage is sod seeding a technique widely used by rice farmers in southern australia rice is seeded directly in a well grazed pasture sward with a sod seeder that gives minimum disturbance of the soil before sowing the pasture is heavily grazed by sheep if the soil is too hard for sod seeding the field is irrigated before sowing after sowing the field is flush irrigated and grazed the sheep may eat some rice tops but the plants soon recover sodseeding offers advantages of reduced cost of production improved utilization of nitrogen fixed by leguminous pasture crops greater utilization of pasture less soil disturbance less weed problem firm ground ensuring easy harvest and high grain yield in conventional sod seeding pasture competition after sowing is eliminated by grazing or scalding or both in a newer technique called chemical sod seeding the pasture sward is eliminated with a presowing herbicide such as paraquat clough 1974 soil compaction to substitute for puddling compaction of the soil with a roller has been suggested as a way to get the benefits of puddling without puddling varade and ghildyal 1967 changes in soil physical properties compaction is the increase in soil density caused by dynamic loading on dynamic loading the soil solids are rearranged and the compression of liquid and gas within the soil pores takes place during compaction soil particles move to a closer state of contact as a result of which both bulk density and porosity change the degree of compaction depends on soil moisture the compactive energy the nature of the soil and the amount of manipulation the state of compaction affects the soil airwater temperature relationship profoundly and affects the physical chemical and biological properties of soil ghildyal 1978 effect on grain yield in the field study soil compaction to 188 gcm 3 helped to conserve nitrogen increased the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer and reduced hydraulic conductivity furthermore compaction helped increase grain new tillage concepts

considerably after compaction ghildyal 1978 reported that soil compaction to densities of 175 g cm 3 reduced the water requirement oft he crop considerably as compared with puddling table 89 the primary reason for increased wateruse efficiency after compaction was due to reduced percolation losses of moisture in lighttextured soils compaction destroys the soil macrovoids and results in decreased hydraulic conductivity and percolation losses puddling on the other hand leaves some macrovoids intact causing lesser reduction in hydraulic conductivity the factor most discouraging to adopting compaction instead of puddling a soil however is that transplanting is imbossible in a compacted soil because transplanting into puddled soil has many distinct advantages over dibbling into dry or moist compacted soil transplanting will be difficult to replace in the foreseeable future if transplanting should be replaced it would be more appropriate to replace it with direct seeding into dry soil without compacting it table 89 effect of puddling and compaction on grain yield water use and water use efficiency adapted from ghildyal 1978 water use grain water efficiency yield use kg

soils power and economic resources of farmers affecting choice of land preparation the power sources for tillage of rice soils are human animal and mechanical the particular source or combination of sources varies from place to place the animal has been the principal tillage power source in asia for thousands of years in lowland rice culture the water buffalo is commonly used in dryland fields upland rainfed lowland and deepwater cattle are normally used in pairs water buffalo are seldom worked in pairs because they are difficult to train in pairs and because the draft in the wetland soil is light the water buffalo works in the lowland field at a pace compatible to man and can be productively employed for 46 hoursday fig 812 animalpower tillage equipment includes a wooden or steel plow a wooden or steel harrow a sled for leveling and in the case of upland rice a wooden harrow for furrowing human power is used in some parts of asia where farm size is small less than 05 ha labor is plentiful and wage rates are extremely low less than 030 day the typical equipment is the hoe or mattock at the other extreme land preparation is almost completely mechanized in east asia where rural daily wages are high currently about 800 in the republic of korea 500 in taiwan and 1 500 in japan the principal form of mechanization in east asia is the 10 to 15hp tiller de datta and barker 1978 figure 812 the water buffalo such as in the philippines is a unique animal that can be used for land preparation of lowland fields at a work capacity of 46 hoursday resources of farmers affecting choice of land preparation 289 elsewhere in asia there is considerable mechanization of land preparation but the motives are different from those in east asia unlike in east asia tractors are not normally owned by the farmers but are generally contracted to do only the primary tillage one of the more arduous tasks in rice production the large tractor 55 hp or larger is used extensively for contract tillage in thailand malaysia and some areas in the philippines de datta and barker 1978 annual hours of operation per tractor were reported as about 1360 for thailand 1040 for malaysia and 1400 for the philippines the speed of land preparation is greater with the large tractor and it appears that the large tractor is efficient for initial land preparation if field size is not too small a bogging problem with largetractor use is of great concern in irrigated areas continually planted to rice reports indicate that after 23 years of operation with the large tractor the depth to the plow sole in paddies increased markedly prohibiting further use of the large tractors nichols 1974 the labor animal and machine horsepowerhours required for alternative power sources for primary and secondary tillage are shown in table 810 although labor requirements are reduced dramatically as more horsepower is added the actual horsepower requirements for land preparation do not differ greatly for different power sources if a water buffalo is assumed as about equivalent to one horsepower thus when labor wages are low the cost of alternative sources of power can be approximately compared using the cost per rated horsepower the rising cost and growing scarcity of animals aggravated by table 810 average range of power requirements for wetland tillage for rice production by labor animal

factor encourag ing tractor use in some regions the potential benefits of mechanized land preparation include labor saving reduction of heavy work load increase in yield timeliness of operation and crop intensification although alternatives for employment of saved labor are limited farmers often place a higher value on the saving of labor and the reduction of the work load than is normally realized for example in recent surveys in the philippines adoption of the tractor for tillage resulted principally in a reduction of family labor de datta and barker 1978 over a period of about 10 years labor requirements for land preparation were reduced from 1520 days ha to 10 or less by mechanization recent experiments in the philippines demonstrated no apparent yield gain benefit from mechanized tillage de datta et al 1978 the experiments used five combinations of land preparation equipment in different soils with results in contrast with those from a number of farm surveys that reported higher yields from mechanized farms than from nonmechanized farms but in general the studies failed to separate the effect of mechanization from the effect of fertilizer and other management and input factors binswanger 1978 although more evidence is needed the belief is that no significant yield gains are achieved by substituting mechanical for animal power a major benefit of mechanization that is frequently stressed is time saving or shorter turnaround time reducing the time required for land preparation could have much the same effect as introducing a shortduration variety the benefit may be in the reduced risk of damage to the second crop by drought or cold weather or in the possibility of adding one more crop per growing season observations of production teams at work in the advanced communes in china suggest that they are taking advantage of timeliness in land preparation by using heavy machinery irri 1978 land preparation is mechanized in areas of china with a high population density and large agricultural labor force the irrigation systems are highly developed making it possible to control water effectively at all times which means operations are not slowed by delays in water delivery or by flood or drought in south and southeast asia neither the development of water resources nor the organization of rural labor makes it possible to take full advantage of the potential benefits from more timely tillage in a recent survey in the philippines the only farmers who reported transplanting earlier as a result of mechanization were those who owned their tractors de datta et al 1978 in most cases the introduction of mechanization had reduced the time required for land prepara tion but not the turnaround time in recent survey of the literature on mechanization in south asia including nonrice crops binswanger 1978 concluded that the speed of cultivation made possible by tractors did not have an overriding advantage in the choice of cropping pattern or in crop intensification there are several important factors that influence the benefits and costs of and hence the decision to use a particular land preparation or crop establishment procedure in a given area resources of farmers affecting choice of land preparation 291 in much of the rainfed rice growing area delayed planting results in a loss in yields due to greater probability of drought in the ripening stage and a difference in environmental factors such as solar energy and temperature it takes about a month after the onset of the rains before there is sufficient moisture for puddling thus farmers with rainfed fields typically transplant and harvest a month later than many of the farmers with irrigation depending on the rate of onset of the monsoons and the degree of flooding further delays may also be encountered if conventional puddling and transplanting methods are used it is practical in many rainfed areas to consider alternative methods of land preparation and planting the pattern of yield reduction will vary from year to year place to place and even by varietal type an example of the types of yield reduction encountered however is illustrated in fig 813 the data were based on three surveys in a figure 813 average rice yield of the most widely planted variety in each of 3 years by date of harvest in rainfed areas of bulacan and nueva ecija philippines 1971 1977 figure above each bar refers to percent of area harvested from de datta et al 1978 292 land preparation for rice soils rainfed area of central luzon during a 8 year period modern varieties were grown on nearly 70 of the farms as early as 1971 the average yield reduction was about 30 kgday as the harvest extended into november and december however the introduction of ir36 an early maturing variety 100 110 days vs 125 days for ir20 and 140 days for ir5 has had a dramatic impact on production and yield by allowing farmers to advance their harvesting date for land preparation in rainfed areas the power requirement should be considered a philippine study determined the power requirements and rice yield differences when fields were prepared using different combinations of animal and tractor power on three irrigated and one rainfed site table 811 it cannot be assumed that rainfed areas typically require more power input per hectare however cone penetrometer readings of 246 kgcm 2 35 psi were obtained at about 6cm depth in the rainfed soil and at almost twice that depth in the irrigated soil indicating that the rainfed fields were not as well soaked if a water buffalo works 6 hoursday a hectare of rainfed soils can be prepared for planting in about 3 weeks but the land prepared by water buffalo on rainfed farms in this area ranged from 05 to 1 ha thus with available animal power the time required to prepare a hectare may extend to a month or more de datta et al 1978 an economic survey conducted in the same rainfed village in the philippines indicated that by employing a four wheel tractor for primary tillage land preparation time was reduced from 37 to 27 days assuming that this reduction in time could be translated into higher yields fig 813 the value of the 300 kg additional yield 40 is slightly higher than the custom rate for tillage of one hectare 30 a few rainfed rice farmers in this area hired tractors when

needed to reduce the time required for puddling and transplanting the monsoon crops the introduction of a shortseason variety such as ir36 clearly has a much greater impact on production and profits than the increase in farm power the situation may differ in areas where double cropping is feasible the decision on method of tillage for rainfed rice is related to weed control among many factors tillage is in fact a form of weed control more thorough tillage reduces the weed control problem later but rainfed farms tend to be underpowered furthermore the intermittent rains allow drying of the rainfed paddy that not only enccurages weed growth but also makes it impossible to recommend the inexpensive preemergence herbicide treatments that are used in irrigated areas despite these difficulties weed control is less of a problem in transplanted rainfed than in broadcast rice if weeds are not adequately controlled in the early stages of stand establishment the yield losses in broadcast rice may be severe changes in technology and factorprice relationship have resulted in signifi cant changes in land preparation and crop establishment methods because of the heterogeneity in the rainfed environment there can be no typical set of recommended practices however it appears that no majoreffort should be undertaken to subsidize the mechanization of land preparation in most countries unless other barriers to increased production are removed first lack of farm power does not appear to be the dominant constraint to increased production and cropping intensity references

practices for rice water is indispensable to plant life a plants water content varies by species and within various plant structures and also varies diurnally during the entire growth period the formative water for the plant is obtained mainly from the soil through absorption by the plant roots the plant uses less than 5 of the water absorbed the rest is lost to the atmosphere through transpiration from the plant leaves kramer 1969 summarized the functions of water for a plant it is a vital constituent of cell protoplasm it is a reactant or reagent in chemical reactions it is a solvent for organic and inorganic solutes and gases facilitating their it gives mechanical strength to the plant by producing turgidity an adequate water supply is one of the most important factors in rice production in many parts of tropical asia rice plants suffer from either too much or too little water because of irregular rainfall and landscape patterns water management embraces the control of water for optimum crop yield and the best use of a limited supply of water proper management of water and irrigation systems especially those that rely on stored water enables a water supply during the dry season when yields generally are high due to high solar radiation and greater fertilizer nitrogen response translocation within the plant effect of flooding a main reason for flooding a rice field is that most rice varieties maintain better growth and produce higher grain yields when grown in a flooded soil than when 297 298 water use and water management practices for rice grown in a nonflooded soil water affects the physical character of the rice plant the nutrient and physical status of the soils and the nature and extent of weed growth physical characters of the rice plant the height of the rice plant is directly related to the depth of water in the paddy the plant height generally increases with increasing water depth tiller number of a rice plant on the other hand appears inversely related to water depth at least over a relatively wide range of moisture conditions with progressive drying of the soil tiller number decreases and much more sharply than under the influence of increased water depth culm strength of the rice plant and therefore lodging resistance decreases as the plant height increases thus culm strength decreases if culms elongate as water depth increases there is no evidence that grain straw ratio is affected by water management practice in the rice field senewiratne and mikkelsen 1961 compared growth of rice plants in submerged and upland soil at the early growth stage of rice plants grew larger in the nonsubmerged upland soil than on the submerged soil but later there were more increases in tiller number plant height and leaf area in the submerged soil than in the nonsubmerged soil nutrient status and physical characteristics of flooded soils one benefit of submerging rice soils is that it increases the availability of many nutrients particularly phosphorus potassium calcium silicon and iron but if the soil is highly permeable nutrients will be leached downward from the root zone the processes on nutrient transformations in flooded soil are described in chapter 4 however the question of whether internal drainage is desirable is often raised there are advantages and disadvantages of internal drainage of rice soils the advantages of internal drainage are depression of the concentration of carbon dioxide iron and reducing substances and prevention of the buildup of high concentrations of carbon dioxide iron and organic acids in cold soils the disadvantages of internal drainage are loss of water and loss of nutrients table 91 internal drainage is desirable on cold soils saline and alkaline soils and soils irrigated with saline and alkaline water but in the tropics studies are critically needed to ascertain the benefits of internal drainage in normal soils soil toxicity flooding a soil causes chemical reduction of iron and manganese as well as other elements in the soil various organic acids such as acetic and butyric and gases effects of flooding 299 table 91 loss of nutrients during one season

amounts may retard root development inhibit nutrient absorption and cause root rot usually between the seedling and panicle initiation stages these toxic effects are variously identified as physiological diseases such as akiochi degraded paddy soils in japan and bronzing in sri lanka see chapter 10 toxicity is most often noticed when oxygen in the soil is depleted due to the rapid decomposition of large quantities of organic matter oxygen may be brought into the soil by allowing drainage with moderate drying the reduced substances are then oxidized and the toxicgases may escape through the soil surface percolating water can bring oxygen into the soil and leach toxic substances beyond the rooting zone percolation rates of 23 mmday may correct toxicity problems water temperature both high and low water temperatures have adverse effects on growth and grain yield of rice in japan optimum water temperatures have been reported to be between 25 and 30 c water temperatures greater than 30 c have not shown adverse effects on ir8 and similar indica varieties in pakistan where adverse effects of high water temperatures have been reported to reduce rice yield reduced uptake of silicon potassium sometimes resulting in brown spot caused by helminthosporium oryzae reduced tiller number and increased percentage of unfilled spikelet have also been reported at low water temperatures some indica varieties grow poorly usually with reduced tillering at later stages of rice growth low water temperature delays panicle initiation decreases panicle size and increases sterility nutrient uptake is adversely affected by low 150 c water temperature bhattacharyya and de datta 1971 water depth and weed population emergence of weeds and the types of weeds in a weed population are closely related to the moisture content of the soil and the water depth in the rice field 300 water use and water management practices for rice figure 91 effect of water depth on weed population in a field of ir8 at 28 days after transplanting irri 1968 wet season from de datta et al 1973b conditions that favor weed growth also make weed control difficult moist but unflooded soil warm temperatures and adequate light favor growth of grass in addition the lack of standing water hinders the effective distribution of granular herbicides and higher temperatures and light may stimulate rapid decompo sition of herbicidal components of some compounds water control during the early stages of crop growth has a major effect on weed control as weeds become established it is much more difficult to control them through water management for transplanted rice proper management can substantially substitute for weeding grasses can be completely eliminated if continuous flooding to a 16cm depth is maintained throughout crop growth even with 5 cm of continuous standing water grasses are substantially controlled infestations of other weeds vary greatly with depth of standing water fig 91 sedges are almost completely controlled by continuous flooding at depths of 15 cm and greater broadleaf weed infestation at various water depths is difficult to predict use of a 1025cm water depth has long been practiced in california where water seeding is a common method of stand establishment however con siderable savings of water are possible if a combination of herbicides and good water management practices are followed see chapter 12 types of water loss from rice fields water requirement varies among crops because rice is a semiaquatic plant it requires more water than most other crops water to produce optimum yields of rice must satisfy the evapotranspiration needs of the crop and losses from the types of water loss from rice fields 301 paddy areas through percolation and seepage timely water supply is equally important for optimum growth and high grain yields of rice the amount of water required varies with the growth duration of the rice variety type of soil topography of land and so on water consumption also varies with the stage of the crop the principal moisture losses from the rice paddy may be grouped into vapor losses and losses in liquid form both can be determined by field measurements the vapor losses can be further grouped into loss by transpiration from the leaf surface and by evaporation at the water surface the two types of liquid losses are the downward movement or vertical percolation of free water which the runoff of excess water over the field levees relieves the surface soil and upper subsoil of superfluous moisture evapotranspiration or consumptive water use when the soil is maintained in a saturated or flooded condition evapo transpiration is primarily a function of the energy available for evaporation of the water the combined losses of water resulting from plant transpiration and surface evaporation are called evapotranspiration et it is also commonly referred to as consumptive water use et is generally measured in tanks lysimeters and plots consumptive water use is measured for a larger area both are expressed in millimeters of water depth over the area considered transpiration transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor to the atmosphere through surface pores stomatal openings in the plant foliage in response to the atmospheric demand the water of transpiration usually reaches a maximum value in the afternoon and the minimum value just before the sun rises soil moisture content and plant characters such as location and distri bution of stomata the reduction of transpiration surface leaf rolling and plant age affect transpiration rate evaporation evaporation is the moisture lost in vapor form from the free water surface where rice is grown evaporation is one of the important factors that determine the effectivity of rainfall particularly in arid or semiarid areas because shading of the water surface reduces evaporation daily evaporation losses from the paddy surface are less for rice planted at close spacings and decrease as a crop approaches maturity 302 water use and water management practices for rice rate of evapotranspiration the et rate is affected by solar energy the higher the solar energy the higher the et the solar energy incident on water and plants varies greatly from area to area and from day to day within a given area temperature higher temperature increases evaporation of water wind or air movement a dry wind continually sweeps away moisture vapor relative humidity et is higher at lower relative humidity eg 40 than at higher relative humidity eg 80 plant characteristics et is influenced by plant characteristics including leaf morphology depth of rooting and growth duration soil water regime if the soil is saturated or submerged et will be at maximum rate however et will be reduced with decrease in soil moisture content from a wet surface in most of the tropics the evapotranspiration requirement during the wet season is 45 mm day during the dry season 67 mm day may be required for large irrigated areas for small irrigated areas the dry season et may be high because of advective energy energy brought in by wind from drier unirrigated areas determination of evapotranspiration the amount of water available to the roots of rice plants depends on the balance between rainfall and evaporation and the relationship between soil moisture content water potential and conductivity effective rooting depth and water table yoshida 1979 tomar and otoole 1979 suggest the following benefits of accurate measurement or estimation of evapotranspiration better engineering design and management of irrigation facilities development of sound practices by irrigation agronomists determination of the water balance of rainfed rice and estimation of supplemental irrigation as water conservation goals to meet the crops water requirement evaluation of cropping patterns suitability based on the water balance estimate for a particular area classification of rice environment where genetic and agronomic technology may be transferrable the determination of actual or potential evapotranspiration has wide utility and has been studied in detail from lowland rice fields three approaches have been used to determine the evapotranspiration types of water loss from rice fields 303 1 the hydrologicalor water balance approac h this includes methods such as catchment hydrology soil moisture sampling and lysimetry the most accurate is lysimetry but it is expensive for upland crops weighing lysimeters are necessary for daily or short time interval measurements for lowland rice however a different principle is used the change in water level in square or circular tank lysimeters is measured to refer to evapotranspiration recently tomar and otoole 1980 proposed a simple and sensitive microlysimeter to measure daily or hourly evapotranspira tion from lowland rice fields that microlysimeter consists of two principal parts a polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinder with a closed bottom and a mariotte system to maintain a constant water level in the pvc cylinder and to serve as a reservoir cummanometer et is calculated by measuring the decrease in water column height in the reservoircummanometer before field installation the unit is calibrated in the laboratory the microlysimeter is installed 1 or 2 days before transplanting by excavating the soil the excavated soil is replaced layerwise to the field level in the lysimeter cylinder as shown in fig 92 the mariotte system is connected to the pvc cylinder after installation the microlysimeter is ready for measurements 2 micrometeorological approach this includes such diverse methods as aerodynamic or mass transport profile method eddy correlation method energy balance bowen ratio method and combination of aerodynamic and energy balance methods the energy balance method is a favored micro meteorological method the energy balance equation can be used to derive precise estimates of et the energy balance equation is 1 where rn is the net radiation flux le is the flux of latent heat l is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the quantity of water evaporated and represents et losses h is the sensible heat flux above the surface and g is the ground heat flux p represents photosynthesis and m represents miscellaneous exchanges because the sum of p and m is small it is normally neglected in the estimation thus equation 1 becomes 2 using the bowen ratio hle equation 2 can be solved for le as follows 3 thus by measuring net radiation and ground heat flux and knowingthe value of et can be estimated in the ricegrowing areas of monsoonal asia monthly average solar radiation ranges from 300 to 650 calcm 2 per day the corresponding range of potential evapotransporation is 37 mmday yoshida 1979 observed that computed figure 92 cross section of fieldinstalled microlysimeters for measuring evapo transpiration and transpiration a and details of mariotte system b from tomar and otoole 1980 304 types of water loss from rice fields 305 figure 93 relationship between potential evapotranspiration and pan evaporation for 1972 and 1973 irri from yoshida 1979 potential evapotranspiration was closely correlated with the observed united states class a pan evaporation rate at irri fig 93 on an average the potential evapotranspiration is related to the pan evaporation as e 093 pan evaporation 4 thus the estimated potential evapotranspiration of a lowland rice field is slightly lower than the observed pan evaporation de datta et al 1973b examined the relationship between solar radiation rs and pan evaporation at irri and obtained two regression lines for 1971 and 1972 the two regression lines were basically the same and the combined regression line is given as pan evaporation 07546 00096 rs 5 where rs is the incident solar radiation calcm2 per day by yoshida 1979 suggested further simplicity and the equation can be expressed pan evaporation 00113 rs 6 pan evaporation rates calculated from equations 5 and 6 generally agree for tomar and otoole 1979 estimated evapotranspiration by using incident the range of solar radiation from 300 to 700 calcm2 per day solar radiation as et mmday 09 00115 rs 7 3 empirical methods many empirical climatological estimates have been used to estimate potential evapotranspiration 306 water use and water management practices for rice the food and agriculture organization doorenbos and pruitt 1977 suggested blaney criddle radiation penman and pan evaporation methods to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 from available climatological data et 0 is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of 815 cm tall green grass cover of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water the effect of crop characteristics on crop water requirements is given by the crop coefficient kc which presents the relationship between reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 and actual crop evapotranspiration or et kc et 0 in several countries us weather bureau class a pan or sunken pan installed in the rice field data have been correlated with actually measured et evaporation pans provide measurement that integrates the effect of solar radiation wind temperature and humidity on evaporation from a specific open water surface to eliminate the effect of these meteorological factors the values of e transpiration and et have been divided by the value of pan evaporation ep these ratios can then be used to compare the difference between variety cropping seasons and latitudes tomar and otoole 1979 the et ep ratio in rice starts around 10 after transplanting shows a first peak 11 and 13 at the maximum tillering stage and a maximum value at about heading stage the value at heading time became 14 15 in malaysia and 17 in the philippines tomar and otoole 1979 on the average this value is 143 for tropical countries it is 133 for japan and 137 for australia evans 1971 fig 94 thus on the average this ratio is 10 at the time of transplanting reaches 115 after 15 20 days and attains a maximum of 13 14 at about heading tomar and otoole concluded that over the whole rice crop growth period et from lowland rice fields is more than open pan evaporation during that period they suggest the relationship et 12 ep fig 95 reviewing the various methods of estimating evapotranspiration wickham and sen 1978 contended that although penmans equation is accurate the input data required to use it is difficult to collect in many countries it is true that installation and operation of an evaporation pan is much less expensive than installation and operation of solarimeters there are however cases when solar radiation data are available but pan evaporation data are not easily available consequently there is a need for a simple model that relates solar radiation data to evapotranspiration yoshida 1979 attempted to simplify energy balance of a lowland rice field with a model that uses solar energy data the model agrees well with measurements and helps understand mechanisms of evapotranspiration provides means by which evapotranspiration can be estimated from solar gives quantitative estimates of water deficit for drought stress energy data figure 94 growth

evapotranspiration at different locations from tomar and otoole 1979 307 308 water use and water management practices for rice provides means with which measured evapotranspiration can be examined if serious error in measurement is suspected percolation losses percolation losses are a function of the local soil and topographic conditions therefore at any time the amount of rainfall or irrigation water entering a soil becomes greater than its waterholding capacity loss by the downward movement of free water vertical percolation will occur percolation is often defined as the movement of moisture through saturated soils due to gravity hydrostatic pressure or both where the soil is heavy and the water table is close to the soil surface percolation losses are lowabout 1 mm day or less where soil is light and the water table is deep percolation losses may be high10 mmday or more if percolation rates are high it is difficult to maintain a saturated or flooded soil other factors that affect percolation losses are presence of a crop the amount and distribution of rainfall soil shrinkage and cracking soil compaction flooding and depth of water and soil puddling research in japan has indicated that a percolation rate of 1015 mmday was favorable for supply of dissolved oxygen the removal of harmful substances and the maintenance of root activity however there was little benefit on yield under good soil conditions in fact with some situations the loss of plant nutrients may be serious if the percolation rate is high sugimoto 1969 evaluated percolation rate in relation to grain yield in an experiment in tanks in malaysia the enameled iron tanks had a drainage pipe of 125 cm diameter at the side near the bottom of the tank the tanks had a 5cm gravel layer and an 188cm layer of soil over the gravel the percolation rate was regulated by a pinchcock compared with the nopercolation stagnantwater treatment grain yield of bahagia rice was increased by a 10 mmday percolation rate a percolation rate of 20 mmday gave lower yield than percolation at 10 mmday table 92 circulated percolation decreased grain yield probably due to accumulation of toxic substances various studies suggest that the range of percolation varies between wide limits from less than 1 mmday in compact soil up to several hundred millimeters per day in loose soil wann 1978 field studies in the philippines in the dry season have shown mean percolation rates to be 13 mmday on alluvial and elastic soils with water tables between 05 and 2 m and 26 mmday when the water table is deeper than 2 m kampen 1970 seepage losses seepage losses are most important where the lowland rice field borders a natural or artificial drainage channel in that situation the water lost usually is not table 92 rice

area but seepage losses in upper areas of a sloping landscape can provide substantial extra water to the lower area seepage losses can be reduced to small proportions with adequate manage ment of water and maintenance of paddy bunds there are two kinds of seepage losses perimeter seepage which is that water moving from a rice growing area into a creek or areas not planted to rice and is therefore considered a water loss levee seepage which is the lateral subsurface movement of water within a ricegrowing area and is not a loss except where it occurs through the last levee bund separating the field from a drain seepage is difficult to estimate because of wide variation in pore spaces and alternate wetting and drying of bunds near the water surface excessive seepage losses can often be traced to animal or insect burrows through bunds because perimeter seepage usually collects in drains greater losses can be expected where the drainage density is high in a series of experiments thongtawee 1965 studied subsurface lateral seepage through a nonplastic loam soil near a creek lateral seepage to a dryland area was 25 liters hour per meter of levee during the first weeks of the season and increased to a maximum of 58 liters hour per meter 8 weeks later average losses from the plot were 49 mm per day which was about 10 times the daily rate of et along a 590 m length of creek draining fine silty clay soils of an irrigation system in nueva ecija province philippines wickham and sen 1978 found a seepage loss of 156 liters hour per meter of creek the data werecollected while rice fields on both sides of the creek had standing water other causes of high seepage losses from rice growing areas are high perimeter area ratios which are usually found when farmers irrigate small areas separately in the dry season or where rice growing areas are separated by upland dryland or drains drying and cracking of soil which results in high seepage losses when water is resupplied soil textures effect on both seepage and percolation most large creeks and rivers have light textured soils along their banks seepage losses are high when those areas are planted to rice because the soils have a high rate of internal drainage wickham and sen 1978 combined seepage and percolation losses seepage normally flows onto the soil surface or into streams rivers or drainage waterways while percolation flow usually moves to the water table because they types of water loss from rice fields 31 1 occur simultaneously and are difficult to separate in the field seepage and percolation are usually considered together wickham 1978 reported combined losses of 02 mmday in the wet season and 2 6 mmday in the dry season on representative alluvial elastic soils in the philippines these rates wereabout half the rates of et for each season seepage and percolation from soils with unfavorable conditions can be as high as 20 mmday for both seasons measurement of seepage and percolation seepage and percolation is strongly conditioned by the depth to water table proximity to drains sloping fields poorly maintained bunds and greater depths of standing water on the paddy three techniques of measuring seepage and percolation are suitable for field use wickham 1978 1 a cylinder method uses a system of two cylinders buried in the soil with rice growing inside them the tops of the cylinders are open above the soil and water surface one cylinder is open at the bottom and the other closed fig 96 both cylinders are filled with water to a given reference level daily the water required to refill the cylinder with the closed bottom is the et rate and the water required to refill the open bottom cylinder is et plus seepage and percolation subtracting the first from the second gives the seepage and percolation rate the prevention of lateral seepage the unrepresentative soil placed inside the cylinders and enhanced percolation at the interface between the cylinder wall and the soil are shortcomings of this measurement technique 2 a manometer method measures the fall in water level with a simple meter the fall is assumed to be the sum of et and seepage and percolation figure 96 seepage and percolation measurement with open and closed cylinders from wickham 1978 312 water use and water management practices for rice figure 97 seepage and percolation measurement with a sloping gauge adapted from wickham 1978 provided there is no irrigation or rainfall contributing water and no surface drainage from the paddy seepage and percolation are determined by subtracting rough estimates of et the technique uses soils in situ and is quite accurate provided there is no surface water flow rainfall can be included in the calculations for added precision the meter can be placed in the water at an angle to magnify the difference in changes of water level fig 3 a water balance technique can measure the amount of added water and its loss components this technique is probably the most useful because it is representative of a broad area rather than just one paddy or small area at least 20 ha should usually be included if possible however the necessary flow measurements of irrigation and surface drainage are difficult and expensive and frequently cannot be made with accuracy in general accuracy of water balance analysis increases when applied to larger areas 97 surface drainage surface drainage represents a major water loss in almost all irrigated or rainfed sites and is most severe during the wet season drainage results from the supply of additional water to filled paddies although drainage water is sometimes available for later irrigation by use of pumps or a downstream checkdam it is generally considered lost for a particular crop area and crop season water use and moisture stress effects 313 water use and moisture stress effects at different growth stages water use and moisture stress effects vary at different growth stages of rice sufficient moisture supply is more critical in some growth stages than others moisture stress reduces crop yield most when it occurs during the critical growth stages water use it is generally believed that cereal crops show a marked sensitivity to moisture stress during the formation of the reproductive organs and during flowering by and large cereal crops can withstand and recover from mild or relatively brief periods of moisture stress if favorable conditions are quickly reestablished with more severe stress the preflowering stage is the least sensitive and the anthesis and spikeletfilling stages are the most sensitive matsushima 1962 reported that rice is most sensitive to moisture stress from 20 days before heading to 10 days after heading van de goor 1950 had earlier reported that flooded rice used the maximum amount of water at that time that suggests that the critical period for moisture stress coincides with the period in which plants use the most water seasonal water requirement differs with different growth stages for water management practices of rice the growth stages of rice can be divided as the seedling vegetative growth reproductive and ripening stages in areas with low rainfall or a highly variable rainfall pattern irrigation practices should be developed to assure needed water at the critical growth stages seedling stage the water requirement of rice is low at the seedling stage in fact if seeds are submerged the development of radicles is affected by lack of oxygen supply vegetative growth stages the production of an adequate number of tillers is an important factor in rice yields immediately after transplanting sufficient water should be provided to facilitate early rooting following the early rooting stage a shallow water depth facilitates tiller production and promotes firm root anchorage in the soil excessive water at this stage seriously hampers rooting and decreases tiller production leaf blades and leaf sheaths of the submerged plants become weak turn light green and break easily reproductive growth stage reproductive growth starts when maximum tiller production is completed and includes the panicle primordia development booting heading and flowering 314 water use and water management practices for rice stages a large amount of water is consumed in the major part of the reproductive growth period which explains why rice is sensitive to moisture stress during reproductive growth two factors should be considered for water management at this stage drought at this stage causes severe damage particularly when it occurs from panicle initiation to flowering stages increased panicle sterility caused by impeded panicle formation heading flowering or fertilization occurs if sufficient moisture is not provided the other factor is excessive water at the reproductive stage particularly at the booting stage which causes decrease in culm strength and increases lodging ripening stage the last phase of the growing period includes the milk dough yellowish and full ripening grain stages very little water is needed at this period and after the yellowish ripening stage no standing water is required this allows draining of a field about 10 days before harvest and facilitates harvesting by machine rodent damage may increase on drained fields however moisture stress effects at different growth stages it is generally believed that the peak water demand of rice is between maximum tillering and the grain filling stage in an irri experiment on maahas clay aquic tropudalf moisture stress imposed at various growth stages was allowed to reach 50 centibars cb after which 5 cm of water was added to the plot table 93 grain yield and water use of ir8 grown in tanks with and without bottoms

reduced the grain yield to 2025 of the yield of the continually flooded treatment when moisture stress was allowed to develop only between the maximum tillering and the heading stages the grain yields remained relatively high the reduction in grain yield of ir8 grown on the maahas clay was more related to the duration of moisture stress than to the stages of plant growth at which the stress occurred in subsequent greenhouse studies with ir8 ir5 and a traditional variety h4 moisture stress early in the growth of the rice plant reduced tillering table 94 thereby reducing grain yield if the stress was relieved before the reproductive phase began some recovery in grain yield occurred through an increase in table 94 yield components of the three rice varieties subjected to moisture stress

number of spikelets per panicle but if the stress period extended into the reproductive phase a reduction in number of filled spikelets decreased grain yield further moisture stress in the late vegetative and reproductive phases mth and h m resulted in a decrease in grain yield through a reduction in number of spikelets per panicle percentage of filled spikelets and the 100grain weight thus the contribution of panicle number increases with later moisture stresses the traditional variety h4 was particularly sensitive to moisture stress in the spikelet filling stage stresscaused filled spikelet percentage and the 100grain weight decreased markedly the results with h4 are similar to the results reported by matsushima 1962 in field and greenhouse experiments there was a negative linear relationship between the relative grain yield of ir8 and the duration of the stress period although the lines had different slopes for each experiment the relative yield of ir8 after stress from maximum tillering to the heading stages fell significantly above the line of best fit to the other data points fig 98 these data suggest that grain yield is less affected by moisture stress at this growth stage than at the other stages figure 98 relative grain yield as a function of the number of days soil was not flooded yield of ir8 from treatments with water stress from maximum tillering to heading in tanks with bottoms is shown by point a in tanks without bottoms by point b and in the greenhouse by point c from de datta et al 1973a water use and moisture stress effects 317 those

raising seedlings it is estimated that 150 200 mm of water is needed for nursery preparation and 250400 mm is needed for irrigation to raise seedlings for 3040 days a period generally used by many farmers in south and southeast asia for modern varieties 21day old seedlings are generally considered optimum for trans planting however 16 35dayold seedlings of modern varieties are not uncommon at the time of transplanting only 667 m 2 for wet seedbed is needed to raise enough seedlings for a hectare of the main field land preparation the amount of water needed to prepare land depends mainly on soil type and water holding capacity but most importantly on type of land preparation water is used 1 2 days before plowing to moisten the soil for easy working after a prolonged dry period large quantities of water are needed to fully moisten the soil for tillage by draft animals kung and atthayodhin 1968 suggested that 200 mm of water is commonly used for land preparation and initial flooding however the amount varies from country to country table 95 in a comprehensive study on total water requirement for land preparation of irrigated lowland rice wickham and sen 1978 reported

management requirements management requirements are at a minimum but care should be taken to provide water control structures and drainage facilities to minimize over flooding water temperature daytime water temperature fluctuation is slight generally the mean tempera ture of water is about the same as the mean air temperature continuous flowing irrigation the practice of continuous flowing irrigation may be useful if irrigation water temperature is high such is the case in the kyushu and shikoku districts in japan where field water temperature is often as high as 40 c in july and august therefore the practice is desirable in high temperature areas because it will lower the water and soil temperatures check abnormal soil reduction and reduce sterility in rice grains however it is desirable to reduce the water temperature before it is introduced in the main field on the other hand in hokkaido tohoku or in intermountain areas incentral japan and in parts of the republic of korea it is not uncommon to register water temperatures of 25 c or lower under those conditions continuous flowing irrigation may increase the water and soil temperature for both hot and cold water continuous flowing irrigation may increase the availability of soil nutrients generally flowing irrigation will keep the surface soil oxidized a highly desirable effect in soils that are strongly

1963 grain yield continuous flowing irrigation has the potential to produce optimum rice yields for example in an experiment in kyushu district in japan rice yields with continuous flowing irrigation 35 cm depth were generally higher than the continuous static submerged plot 5 cm depth or a watersaving irrigation plot fig 910 the water temperature was lowest in the continuous flowing irrigation plot and highest in watersaving irrigation plot in an experiment at japans niigata agricultural experiment station flowing irrigation practiced from 35 days before heading to maturity gave about 7 increase in yield over that from continuous static submerged plots there was however 8 reduction in grain yield if flowing irrigation was practiced throughout crop growth indicating the period of flowing irrigation may be critical matsubayashi et al 1963 a study in the philippines showed that continuous flowing irrigation plots give yields similar to those from continuous static submerged plots at various depths table 98 growth characteristics growth characteristics for rice in continuous flowing irrigation are essentially the same as in a similar flooding depth with static water

percolation losses are similar to static flooding at the same depth these total between 600 and l000 mm during a 90100day irrigation period the flow requirement will vary depending upon management practice a flow requirement of 12001500 mm has been commonly found when deliberate drainage is practiced to provide a form of flow flooding in the philippines and malaysia when designed as a part of controlled system the flow requirement can be reduced considerably in irri experimental fields as much as 4581 mm of water were used from transplanting to maturity for a continuous flowing treatment table 98 water management requirements where water supply is available in large quantities the management requirement for continuous flowing irrigation is limited to maintaining the spillway height of the lowland rice field to control outflows consistent with irrigation inflow rates and the drainage systems capability where the water supply is limited the water distribution must be managed to prevent excess water from leaving the productive area for efficient water use the water flowing from the paddies must be recaptured for use on lower paddies other management requirements a continuous flowing irrigation system causes some loss of nitrogen 510 kg n ha from the soils however if the adjacent paddy also belongs to the same farmer nitrogen will be added there flowing irrigation may not be desirable during the time of herbicide and insecticide applications water temperature with continuous flowing irrigation water temperature tends to be lower in the hot areas and warmer in cold areas daytime water temperature fluctuations are relatively low rotational irrigation rotational irrigation is the application of required amounts of water to fields at regular intervals the field may often be without standing water between 326 water use and water management practices for rice irrigations but ideally the soil does not dry enough for moisture stress to develop rotational irrigation is often recommended to irrigate a large area with a limited water supply to ensure better equity among water users a major advantage of rotational irrigation is possibly the more effective use of rainfall in the rice field in taiwan for example rotational irrigation is as effective as continuous static flooding if not better in the philippines the method did not receive much attention until the upper pampanga river irrigation project was initiated that system was designed to irrigate thousands of hectares at 5day intervals with an equivalent irrigation water flow of 13 mm day at the

cooperation conveyance systems must be equipped with additional structures such as division boxes and flow measuring devices and weed growth is greater when the plots lack standing water for a time

efficiency of rice varieties with different growth durations irri 1972 dry season from de datta et al 1973b other management requirements generally other management requirements are increased with rotational irrigation for example weed control and fertilizer nitrogen applications have to be coordinated with irrigation rates and intervals distribution and stability of herbicides are likely to be poor unless specific procedures for water management during the first 710 days after transplanting are developed for effective herbicide use under usual procedures manual or mechanical weeding may be necessary because of alternate moist or dry and fully flooded conditions some nitrogen loss is possible which calls for nitrogen application in split doses water temperature temperatures are variable

fluctuations increase as the water level decreases and remain high until the next irrigation water management systems characteristics and limitations 329 midseason soil drying japanese farmers practice midsummer soil drying or midsummer drainage nakaboshi of the rice paddy the reason for the practice is not very clear the primary benefit in japan is to change the root zone temporarily to an oxidized state which in some cases prevents root rot disease removal of anaerobic toxins and carbon dioxide is a distinct advantage of midseason drying of some soils table 910 another advantage is regulation of nutrient supply to the crop particularly nitrogen supply at the later stages to suppress growth of late tillers some irrigation water may also be saved but where water supply and control are poor as is the case in the asian tropics midseason drying may subject the rice crop to undue water stress other disadvantages include possible root pruning caused by soil shrinkage the reversal of beneficial ph changes and increased loss of nitrogen midsummer drainage is done late in the tillering stage prior to the early panicle formation stage at that stage the number of panicles is fixed and the requirement of water by the rice crop is minimal however when physiological disease symptoms such as reddish brown sheath rot akagare occur earlier than the late tillering stage water should be immediately removed from the paddies or at least reduced in japan midsummer drainage is advocated in soils where rapid soil reduction takes place and where excessive nitrogen applied as a fertilizer which delays ripening should be removed by rapid soil oxidation at the late stages of rice growth water management between crops the choice of water management practice between crops is largely determined by the farmers objectives the choice is mainly between dry and flooded fallow dry fallow the dry fallow condition is a common practice in most rice growing areas allowing the soil to dry between crops saves water and hastens ammonification on reflooding the disadvantages are reversal of reduction and loss of about 4080 kg nha per season flooded fallow with flooded fallow conditions standing water is maintained between crops the advantages are favorable chemical environment reduction of nitrogen loss and accretion of about 150 kg nha per year the disadvantages are high water use

supply to the crop is good grain yield will be similar to irrigated rice growth characteristics plant growth for rainfed rice depends on the amount of rainfall and distribution throughout the season plant height is generally reduced and semidwarf rices often do not perform as well as intermediatestatured rices about 130 cm tall with dry soil conditions the intermediatestatured rices will be as tall as the semidwarfs are with ideal irrigation if there is stagnant water 3050 cm deep in rainfed fields the intermediatestatured rice has the best chance to produce 23 tha water requirement rainfall of 9001000 mm during the growing season is adequate to produce optimum yields with moderate level of water management more rainfall is necessary when management is less satisfactory in an experiment during the 1966 wet season total water use for rainfed rice was about half 457 mm of that with 10 cm of continuous flooding 803 mm percolation losses were con siderably lower for rainfed condition table 911 water use efficiency water use efficiency in rainfed fields is poor unless the rainfall is well distributed over the growing season and is near the total amount required by the crop water management requirements where normal rainfall exceeds 1500 mm which is fairly common in most southeast asia and is reasonably well distributed throughout the growing season relatively little management is required unless surplus water accumulates in a field due to low topographic position sometimes drainage may be needed to eliminate excess water nonuniform rainfall distribution is common in all of monsoonal asia however where the normal rainfall is about 1000 mm or less and distribution is often uneven as is the case for most of south asia careful water management must be practiced bunds must be carefully maintained to minimize seepage and surface drainage losses higher bunds carefully maintained allow greater depth of water to be retained in the lowland rice fields

germination and growth of weeds tend to approach the ideal at the same time conditions for weed control with herbicides are poor hand or mechanical weeding provides the most effective weed control herbicides can be used if water is available to keep the paddies flooded during 710 days after transplanting fertilizer nitrogen management is equally difficult in rainfed rice because of large losses of nitrogen because of alternate wetting and drying nitrogen is lost through denitrification see chapter 4 if leaching losses are high due to high water head nitrogen losses through leaching may also be substantial water temperature water temperature will vary depending upon the depth of water in the rainfed paddy and the climatic conditions at a given time water management practices for continuous cropping with increased demand for all food crops and particularly rice efforts have been increased to raise total food production one way to achieve that is to increase cropping intensity good water management is an important prerequisite to increasing cropping intensity continuous rice cropping when adequate and assured water supply is available continuous rice cropping with at least three crops a year is possible where yearround favorable temperature provides that opportunity experiments suggest that continual flooding is not essential for high grain yield but modern rice varieties can tolerate at least 15 cm of water depth without adversely affecting grain yield in an irri experiment yields on continually shallow flooded plots were similar to those on plots continually flooded at 10cm depth table 97 deeper submergence has other advantages however such as suppression of weed growth higher efficiency of fertilizer and better insect and weed control with granular chemicals considering all factors continuous submergence with 575 cm of water is probably best for continuous cropping of irrigated rice ricebased cropping systems it is becoming increasingly evident that continuous yearround rice cropping is often undesirable even where there is an adequate water supply the growing of 334 water use and water management practices for rice other crops in rotation with rice means a large increase in both nutritional and economic benefits in addition rice pest pressure is less under a good rotational system in heavy textured soils however it is difficult to switch from puddled soil to the nonpuddled soil which is essential to grow an upland crop strong arguments have been presented for the practice of furrow irrigating rice on nonpuddled soil as a desirable alternative to soil puddling for rice cultivation maintaining the soil in a nonpuddled or dryland condition allows the ready insertion of other crops into a rotation centered around rice research data irri 1971 show that more than one third of the water involved in et is from the surface of the standing water in a rice field thus the practice of furrow irrigation in a nonpuddled soil might lower the requirement of rice for irrigation water evaporation from the field would be retarded by the mulching effect of the dry surface soil deep percolation losses could also be reduced the importance and benefits to be derived by reducing the irrigation requirement of rice have been discussed by young 1970 water management in direct seeded flooded rice in the asian tropics rice is primarily transplanted for stand establishment however in most of sri lanka and in parts of india and bangladesh rice is broadcast seeded either in the dry soil or a wet or moist soil seeding into standing water is not common in the tropics because lack of proper water control and low oxygen concentration in water under the high temperatures that occur in the tropics lead to poor stand establishment there is experimental evidence however which suggests that broadcast seeding into water is a distinct possibility if proper water management can be provided in an experiment by de datta et al 1973b as the water depth was increased for direct seeded flooded rice crop establishment or number of plants per square meter was decreased a brief drainage period at the maximum tillering and panicle initiation stages reduced lodging but increased weed populations table in the united states where rice is entirely direct seeded systems of water management for rice production vary widely depending on method of seeding soil type climate crop rotation diseases and insects essentially there are two broad systems of water management revolving around seeding method one is used in drill seeding or broadcast seeding in dry soil the other involves water seeding wherein fields are flooded just before aerial seeding and usually remain flooded until they are drained for harvest 912

1976 studied total water requirements for maximum grain yield in arkansas on silt loam soils with an impervious subsoil 450600 mm of water was used per season in areas of clay soils with high transmission and seepage losses common the water use range was 11201500 mm a water depth of 5 10 cm produced maximum yields and minimum losses fig 913 energy costs and a limited quantity of good quality water in some areas have caused increased interest in water conservation measures measures that will minimize water needs are selection of fields and soil types that will hold more water improved field topography accurate survey and control of levees use of underground pipes instead of canals for delivery drainage only when necessary flooding to only 5 10 cm depth use of short season varieties reuse of water water management in direct seeded flooded rice 337 minimized pumping at peak power requirement periods the shut off of pumping before water reaches the last bund allowing water in transit to fill the last bunds and avoiding excessive overflow huey 1977 where rice has been drilled or broadcast in a dryland soil and covered the soil may need to be flushed if moisture is inadequate for germination or if a crust has formed as a result of drying following rains a flush should be applied before the young seedlings lose penetrating power germination of seeds is not good if the seeds are covered by both water and soil a continuous flood is essential for high yield but during the vegetative stage nearnormal growth may be maintained without flooding provided that moisture is sufficient for adequate growth during the reproductive stage losses due to evaporation transpiration seepage and percolation may be as much as 125 mmday for silt loam and 25 mmday for clay soils when temperatures during that dry climate in july august reach about 38c huey 1977 the clay soils may be subjected to more cracking which explains higher water losses due to percolation than in silt loam soils in mississippi the first flood is applied as early as 2 weeks after seeding but if germination of rice is low it may be as late as 3 weeks after seeding most fields are drained 3 4 weeks after flooding and soil is allowed to dry for several days in texas when the rice is drill seeded on heavy soils the field is usually flushed for germination if rainwater is insufficient fields are flooded after the seedlings are established the time and number of drainage periods vary with the maturity of the variety availability of irrigation water and insect and disease conditions in

seedlings are fully established reasons for drainage in direct seeded rice reasons cited for draining direct seeded rice fields are grouped into two categories first during the growing season drainage provides control of algae scum and aquatic weeds 338 water use and water management practices for rice control of rice water weevil prevention of blight removal of salts in saline or alkaline affected areas second draining at the proper time before harvest is necessary to dry the soil enough to support harvesting equipment usually water is drained when the rice heads are turned down and are ripening in the upper parts johnston and miller 1973 irrigation system management in rice providing adequate irrigation water is the most important single factor controlling the production of food crops in the tropics to achieve this it is necessary to have an adequate water source a conveyance system to carry the water to the area to be irrigated and a distribution method to spread the water over the land irrigation infrastructure is generally more fully developed in the main system than at the terminal level as a result deficiencies in the conceptualization and management of irrigation systems often preclude the realization of full foodcrop production potential within their command areas the greatest potential for improved water management in irrigation systems in south and southeast asia is often said to beat the farm level but several research projects in the philippines suggest that the problems of water distribution are greater in lateral and sublateral canals than at the farm level therefore a prerequisite for further improvement in terminal level operations and manage ment is the dependable but controlled flow of water in the main system which requires adequate operations and management attention and equitable al location and distribution of the water at the farm level a suitable irrigation system must consider the consumptive water use by rice plants at different growth stages soil texture and its percolation and seepage rates seasonal distribution of rainfall topography of fields the availability of irrigation water wann 1978 the water supplied for irrigated agriculture faces many kinds of potential losses fig 914 conveyance loss of water the loss in conveyance of the water to the irrigated area varies losses are higher in coarsetextured soil irrigation system management in rice 339 figure 914 disposition of water diverted for irrigation a c early irri 1980 personal communication channels having a relatively higher elevation than the surrounding land channels that are relatively long channels with poor maintenance water lost by conveyance may not be entirely lost to crop production because some seepage losses become available for crop use in adjoining areas percola tion losses recharge the water table which may naturally discharge water at other points in the landscape or be pumped for irrigation of new areas the magnitude of conveyance losses cannot be specified generally but in the humid tropics they range between 15 and 40 of the diverted flow ongkingco and levine 1970 with careful management conveyance losses can be reduced to 510 generally older canals lose less water because of progressive sealing of soil pores by sedimentation a suitable method to accurately determine the conveyance loss in a canal is to measure the difference between the quantity of inflow and that of outflow from a selected section of the canal wann 1978 inflow outflow inflow rate of conveyance loss 100 340 water use and water management practices for rice distribution loss of water the distribution losses of irrigation water are mainly due to use of an average pattern of minimal water measurement too few farm ditches independent control by the farm operator of water on his land substantial portions of the water losses through distribution channels may be recovered downstream by return flow to creeks and rivers which in turn may be dammed for irrigation diversion the extent of this recycling of irrigation water in the total irrigation system has not been precisely estimated water distribution system water distribution for continuous application of water to rice fields at a certain depth is easiest to achieve if the supply of water is continuous and adequate water distribution for intermittent application by a rotational irrigation system is difficult to accomplish in a rotational irrigation system water is distributed by rotation by section in the main canal which requires bigger capacities for both conveyance and distribution systems than that of continuous irrigation rotation by the laterals or sublaterals or their sections which requires bigger capacity of laterals or sublaterals and farm ditches rotation by farm ditches which requires only bigger capacities of farm ditches selected combinations of the above sources of irrigation water the sources of irrigation are from surface water and groundwater surface water surface water is taken from rivers creeks ponds or lakes the amount of water available from these sources for irrigating rice depends largely on the season normally the greatest quantity of surface water is available during the wet season as a result these surface sources serve as supplementary water sources to the rainwater received during the monsoonal season in the dry season the amount of water available for irrigation is often low and demand is considerably irrigation system management in rice 341 higher if irrigation water is available rice yields can be at least 50 higher in the dry season than in the wet season because of higher solar radiation when the water level in a stream is lower than the area to be irrigated the level may be raised by constructing a dam to divert water to the rice field the dam may be a permanent concrete structure or a temporary dam which is usually reconstructed or repaired yearly sometimes pumps are installed if dam construction is not feasible storage reservoirs are means by which the extra water of the wet season can be stored for release during the dry season when rainfall is inadequate to sustain a crop groundwater groundwater is usually obtained through a well wells are termed shallow or deep depending on the depth of the bore required to obtain the desired discharge from the water bearing geologic formations pumps are used to lift water from the well to the ground level or above for its distribution to the service area kinds of irrigation pumps the types of pumps used for irrigation depend on the flow requirement the lift from the water surface to the pump and the height to which the water is to be raised ongkingco and levine 1970 types include propeller axial flow pumps used for low head about 3 m and high flow centrifugal pumps used where the lift is less than about 7 m deep well turbine pumps generally used when pumping has to be done from conditions a deep water level quality of irrigation water it is important to determine water quality before the water is used for irrigation it is equally important to monitor water quality periodically against the potential hazards of crop damage by poor irrigation water for example some parts of irris experiment station had the soil ph increased to 79 the electrical conductance to 12 mscm 12 mmhocm and the available boron content to 13 ppm as a result of irrigation with alkaline slightly saline deep well water high in bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium boron and silicon the high ph deposition of calcium and magnesium carbonate and the accumulation of silicon depressed the availability of zinc f n ponnamperuma irri 1980 personal communication in arkansas united states many of the irrigation wells produce water containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium carbonates in parts of southwest and southeast arkansas the groundwater contains high levels of 342 water use and water management practices for rice sodium continued application of such poor quality water on a rice field may cause chlorosis and sometimes death of seedlings in california finfrock et al 1960 described good rice irrigation water as that with specific conductance less than 075 mscm 075 mmhocm boron contents of less than 1 ppm sodium adsorption ratio sar index tendency to form alkaline soil less than 10 when high sodium water is used regularly each growing season it may deflocculate the soil so that stickiness compactness and impermeability increase the deflocculated soil makes tillage difficult and usually produces low yields factors affecting irrigation systems many irrigation projects have been less than successful partly because they have been designed and managed almost exclusively from an engineering point of view because irrigation systems are usually built with large expenditures of public funds their design should consider not only engineering aspects such as water storage conveyance and delivery but also agricultural economic social political legal and environmental conditions specialists from various dis ciplines which include engineers soil scientists agronomists economists and other social scientists should work together in designing monitoring field investigating and implementing any successful irrigation system thavaraj 1978 the agricultural factors that are important in designing an irrigation system for lowland flooded rice include cropping schedule the availability of labor and machines and varietal difference in response to moisture levels cropping schedules cropping schedules are generally controlled by soils rainfall distribution and the availability of irrigation water figure 915 shows the amount of available water based on 80 probability of exceedance timing of irrigation is important for soaking fields for land preparation for maximum water use efficiency it is best if vegetative and reproductive periods coincide with wet months and the ripening period coincides with dry months availability of labor and machine labor requirements can be evenly distributed across the entire irrigation system and peak water requirements for land preparation can be reduced by incor porating staggered planting of rice introducing early maturing varieties irrigation system management in rice 343 figure 915 calendar of proposed cropping schedule muda irrigation scheme malaysia from thavaraj 1978 communal nurseries and some degree of mechanization at various levels of farm operations varietal differences there are distinct varietal differences existing in tolerance for excess and shortage of moisture basic agronomic data are essential for design of systems for optimum management these and other relevant information are discussed in details by thavaraj 1978 water control improved water control by better irrigation and drainage is perhaps the most important single factor in achieving the full yield potential of modern rice varieties rice does not require continuous flooding but responds favorably to it this is because many benefits are ascribed to continuous flooding such as better growth and yield better nutrient supply and better weed control water requirements of lowland rice can be grouped as that required for land preparation 344 water use and water management practices for rice figure 916 system water requirement as a function of management level from levine 1969 required for growth and transpiration required for evaporation from the soilwater surface during crop growth lost through percolation seepage and runoff as the management level to conserve moisture and maximize water use efficiency increases water requirement from an irrigation system decreases fig 916 once demand for water for land preparation percolation seepage and et are satisfied the better the water management practices the less is the water requirement from an irrigation system an extended period of water shortage in an area of heavy elastic soils does not result in less total water use compared with continuous water supply if the area is resupplied with water following the stress period this is because of increased seepage and percolation losses from fields that are dried and cracked several factors are considered important in saving water in lowland rice about 100200 mm of water can be saved by preparing the land ex peditiously by growing an earlymaturing variety that has a field duration of 75 days 100day variety instead of growing a variety that has field duration of 105 days 130day variety there can be a net savings of 200350 mm of water references 345 rotational irrigation systems can be used where there are good irrigation water control and distribution systems and excellent farmer cooperation whenever possible continuous flooding with 575 cm of water depth is best for optimum grain yield optimum nutrient supply and excellent weed control with water depth and herbicides because irrigation projects are expensive it is important not only to learn from past experience in designing and managing new systems but also to draw judgment from specialists from various disciplines such as engineers agrono mists soil scientists economists and farmers cooperative specialists that will effectively implement new systems with increased emphasis on cropping intensity dependable and

science 167339 343 mineral nutrition 10 and fertilizer management of rice development of a rational method of fertilizer application requires knowledge of the mineral nutrition of the rice plant at different growth stages it is also essential to know the contributions of the nutrients absorbed to grain yield a dynamic insight into the physiological condition of the plant at any stage of growth requires analytical studies of every part of the plant the characteristics of various plant organs are greatly influenced by environmental factors of which one of the most important is mineral nutrition also studied the process of nutrient uptake of the rice plant at different growth stages as early as 1918 subsequently gericke 1924 and ishizuka 1932 systematically studied the mineral nutrition of the rice plant mineral nutrition nutrition is the supply and absorption of those nutrient chemical elements required by an organism crop nutrients are the elements or simple inorganic compounds indispensable for the growth of crops and not synthesized by the plant during the normal metabolic processes essential elements for rice for rice 16 elements are essentialcarbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur calcium magnesium zinc iron copper molyb denum boron manganese and chlorine these are divided into major and minor elements the major elements c h o n p k ca mg and s are needed by plants in relatively higher amounts than the minor elements fe mn cu zn mo b and cl 348 mineral nutrition 349 all essential elements must be present in optimum amounts and in forms usable by rice plants nitrogen phosphorus zinc and potassium are nutrient elements most commonly applied by rice farmers sulfur is occasionally applied to some soils but sulfur is usually supplied as an ingredient of nh 4 2 so 4 k2so 4 and caso 4 in ordinary superphosphate even where it is not needed silicon although not an essential element is applied to degraded soils in japan republic of korea and taiwan all the other essential nutrients are provided by air water soil and plant residues or as contaminants in commercial fertilizers there are two ways to determine whether a specific element is essential for plant life if plants are grown in a complete nutrient solution lacking only one specific element they show abnormality compared with plants grown in a solution containing the missing element if the specific element in question is added to the nutrient solution in which the abnormal plants are growing the symptoms of abnormality disappear or are reduced in severity diagnosis of nutrient deficiencies and toxicities nutrient deficiency symptoms in the rice plant are seen in color of the leaves stems and roots in plant height and tillering habit and in development of root systems plant height can be normal or stunted yoshida 1975b deficiency symptoms are expressed by the tillers being normal too few or too many in leaves deficiency symptoms will include yellow or dark green appearance presence or absence of interveinal chlorosis presence or absence of brown spots either on the lower or upper leaves brown spots at the tip or the marginal areas of the leaves which vary in size with the severity of the symptoms the best time to observe deficiency or toxicity symptoms in rice is in the early stages of symptom development for example zinc deficiency in lowland rice usually appears within 2 3 weeks after transplanting after which the crop apparently begins to recover when the efficiency is moderate yoshida 1975b it is only when this deficiency is extremely severe that symptoms may persist until flowering or longer on the other hand the symptoms of iron toxicity may appear in 1 2 weeks or not until 1 2 months after transplanting symptoms of some diseases are sometimes confused with those of nutritional 350 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice disorders for example it is difficult to differentiate between zinc deficiency and grassy stunt virus in their early stages functions and deficiency symptoms of nutrients functions and deficiency symptoms of nutrients in rice are largely different for each element nitrogen rice plants require a large amount of nitrogen at the early and mid tillering stages to maximize the number of panicles nitrogen absorbed at the panicle initiation stage may increase spikelet number per panicle some nitrogen however is also required at the ripening stage the functions of nitrogen in rice are gives dark green appearance to plant parts as a component of chlorophyll promotes rapid growth or increased height and tiller number increases size of leaves and grains increases number of spikelets per panicle increases filled spikelets percentage in panicles increases protein content in the grains nitrogen deficiency symptoms are stunted plants with limited number of tillers narrow and short leaves which are erect and become yellowish green as they old leaves become light straw colored and die phosphorus phosphorus is involved in the supply and transfer of energy for all the biochemical processes in the rice plant it stimulates root development promotes earlier flowering and ripening particularly under cool climate encourages more active tillering which enables rice plants to recover more promotes good grain development and gives higher food value to the rice age young leaves remain greener rapidly and more completely after any adverse situation because of phosphorus content of the grain phosphorus deficiency symptoms are stunted plants with limited number of tillers narrow and short leaves that are erect and dirty dark green young leaves remain healthier than older leaves which turn brown and die mineral nutrition 35 1 reddish or purplish color may develop on leaves of varieties that tend to produce anthocyanin pigment potassium potassium is not a constituent of any organic compound of the plant but it is a cofactor for 40 or more enzymes it favors tillering and increases the size and weight of the grains increases phosphorus response plays an important role in physiological processes in the plant including opening and closing of stomata and tolerance to unfavorable climatic conditions renders resistance to diseases such as blast and helminthosporium potassium deficiency symptoms are stunted plants and tillering slightly reduced short droopy and dark green leaves yellowing at the interveins on lower leaves starting from the tip and brown spots sometimes develop on dark green leaves irregular necrotic spots may develop on the panicles long thin panicles form some symptoms of wilting when there is excessive imbalance with nitrogen low k n ratio in plant eventually drying to a light brown color calcium the functions of calcium in the rice plant are as a constituent of the cementing material of plant cells an important constituent of calcium pectate which strengthens the cell wall maintainer of turgidity of the cell walls promoter of normal root growth and development calcium deficiency causes little change in general appearance ofthe plant except in cases of acute deficiency in those the tip of the upper growing leaves becomes white rolled and curled in an extreme case the plant is stunted and the growing point dies magnesium magnesium functions in the rice plant as a constitutent of chlorophyll molecule a component of several essential enzymes functions similar to calcium 352 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice magnesium deficiency symptoms are with moderate deficiency height and tiller number are little affected wavy and droopy leaves due to expansion of the angle between the leaf blade interveinal chlorosis characterized by an orangish yellow color on lower and the leaf sheath leaves sulfur sulfur functions in the rice plant as a constituent of the amino acids cystine cysteine and methionine and the an important factor in the functioning of many plant enzymes enzyme plant hormones thiamin and biotin activators and oxidation reduction reactions sulfur deficiency symptoms are similar to those of nitrogen deficiency which makes it impossible to initially on leaf sheaths which become yellowish proceeding to leaf blades reduced plant height and tiller number fewer panicles shorter panicles and reduced number of spikelets per panicle distinguish between the two deficiencies by visual symptoms alone with the whole plant chlorotic at the tillering stage at maturity one point of distinct difference between nitrogen and sulfur deficiency is that sulfur deficiency produces general chlorosis in the whole plant but the older leaves do not dry quickly nitrogen deficiency induces more intense chlorosis in the older leaves sulfur deficiency delays growth and development whereas nitrogen deficiency hastens flowering and maturity sulfur does not move from older to younger leaves as nitrogen does data from brazil suggest that sulfur deficiency reduces head rice yield and increases chalkiness in grains wang et al 1976a zinc the functions of zinc in the rice plant are probable connection with the production of auxin activation of many enzymatic reactions close involvement in nitrogen metabolism zinc deficiency symptoms are the midribs of the younger leaves especially the base become chlorotic mineral nutrition 353 brown blotches and streaks in lower leaves appear followed by stunted reduced size of the leaf blade but with the leaf sheath little affected uneven growth and delayed maturity in the field yoshida 1968 made four observations on the zinc deficient rice plants in pakistan the brown streaks and blotches of lower leaves appear 23 weeks after transplanting and severely affected plants are usually found in low lying patches growth although tillering may continue most affected plants recover but those severely affected die the disorder usually appears in the first year of rice cultivation following high rates of fertilizer aggravate the disorder and drainage alleviates it the symptoms observed by yoshida were similar to those observed by karim and vlamis 1962 total or available zinc in soil measured chemically has no relevance to incidence of zinc deficiency or plant zinc content yoshida 1968 iron iron functions in the rice plant as related to the formation of the chlorophyll but not a constituent of it a possible catalyst in an organic form or combined with organic compound an inhibitor of the absorption of potassium by the rice plant yamasaki reclamation as a component of redox enzymes 1965 iron deficiency symptoms are entire leaves become chlorotic and then whitish the newly emerging leaf becomes chlorotic if iron supply is cut suddenly manganese manganese functions in the rice plant as a factor in photosynthesis and in oxidation reduction processes an activator of several enzymes such as oxidase peroxidase dehydro genase decarboxylase and kinase manganese deficiency symptoms are stunted plants with normal tiller number intraveinal chlorosis on the leaves 354 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice chlorotic streaks spreading downward from the tip to the base of the leaves newly emerging leaves are short narrow and light green boron boron functions in the rice plant as a catalyst in the plant system a regulator of physiological functions such as nitrogen metabolism and which become dark brown and necrotic nutrient uptake especially calcium metabolism boron deficiency symptoms are reduced plant height the tips of emerging leaves become white and rolled as in the case of calcium the growing points may die in severe cases but new tillers continue to be deficiency produced molybdenum molybdenums function in the rice plant is related to reduction of nitrate to nitrite no deficiency symptoms have been described copper copper functions in the rice plant as a component of metalloenzymes a regulator of enzymatic actions copper deficiency symptoms are bluish green leaves which become chlorotic near the tips development of chlorosis downward along both sides of the midrib followed by dark brown necrosis of the tips new leaves fail to unroll and maintain a needlelike appearance of the entire leaf or occasionally of half the leaf with the basal portion developing normally chlorine chlorine is essential in photosynthesis its deficiency symptoms have not been described in rice silicon on soils low in available silicon the application of silicon will increase yields of a modern variety at high rates of nitrogen fertilizer application the effects of silicon are classified into four categories mineral nutrition 355 1 effects on normal growth of plants promotes growth strengthens culms and roots and favors early panicle increases number of spikelets per panicle and percentage of matured helps maintain erect leaves which is important for high rate of formation grains photosynthesis 2 effects on water economy siliconfree plants suffer from internal water stress when they are placed in environments in which transpiration is greatly increased or water absorption is greatly impaired silicon supply is critical during panicle initiation when root activity is somewhat reduced and transpiration loss of water is high 3 effects on disease and insect resistance a thick cuticle silica layer provides an excellent barrier against attacks of fungi insects and mites because of its physical hardness fig 101 shows the schematic representation of the rice epidermal cell with silica layer silicon application diminishes the unfavorable action of nitrogen on the resistance of rice to diseases such as blast figure 101 schematic representation of the rice leaf epidermal cell sc silica cellulose from yoshida et al 1962 yoshida 1975a 4 effects on other nutrients silicon seems to promote translocation of phosphorus in the rice plant and retention of excessive phosphorus taken up silicon makes soil phosphorus available to rice the leaves of silicondeficient plants become soft and droopy 356 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice mineral toxicity symptoms iron iron toxicity symptoms are tiny brown spots on lower leaves starting from the tips and spreading leaf usually remains green in severe cases the entire leaves become purplish brown aluminum aluminum toxicity symptoms are orangish yellow interveinal chlorosis which may become necrotic in serious cases manganese manganese toxicity symptoms are stunted plant and limited tillering brown spots on the veins of the leaf blade and the leaf sheath especially on toward the bases the spots are generally combined on interveins the lower leaves tanaka and yoshida 1970 boron boron toxicity symptoms include chlorosis at the tips of the older leaves especially along the margins followed by the appearance of large dark brown elliptical spots in the affected parts which ultimately turn brown and dry up in the field vegetative growth is not seriously depressed except in sensitive varieties the first symptom of boron toxicity is a yellowish white discoloration of the tips of the older leaves which appears about 6 weeks after transplanting as the disease progresses the tips and the leaf margins turn yellow two to four weeks later depending on soil boron content and variety elliptical dark brown blotches appear in the discolored areas in most rice varieties finally the entire leaf blade turns light brown and withers m t cayton and f n pon namperuma irri 1979 personal communication salt injury salt toxicity in rice is seen as stunted growth reduced tillering and whitish leaf tips frequently some parts of the leaves become chlorotic tanaka and yoshida 1970 critical nutrient levels in plants and soils determining the critical concentrations of elements in the rice plant below which deficiency symptoms may develop or above which toxicity symptoms may become visible allows diagnosis of abnormal rice plants growing in the field by chemical analyses of the plants plant analysis in most cases nutrient deficiency or toxicity symptoms appear when plants are young which allows whole plants excluding roots to be sampled for chemical mineral nutrition 35 7 analysis plant samples are washed dried and ground for analyses of metallic elements yoshida et al 1972 suggest the use of an atomic absorption spectro photometer whereas for nonmetallic elements such as chlorine and boron colorimetric methods are normally used however information on the critical concentrations of elements in the rice plant is required the critical concentration determined from plants grown in the greenhouse is sometimes too high and is not applicable to the field crop tanaka and yoshida 1970 provided a list of critical concentrations of various elements these concentrations should be used only as a guide for diagnosis table 101 for example the precise critical concentration for zinc deficiency is difficult to establish because of variation among sampled plants interactions between zinc and other elements possibly with phosphorus table 101 deficiency and toxicity critical concentrations of various elements

to 128 kgha blair 1977 yoshida and chaudhry 1979 suggested that the critical sulfur content in leaf blades and straw varies with growth stages table 102 wang 1976 concluded that the critical concentrations of sulfur in straw should be 005 for optimum grain yield fig 102 soil analysis the measurement of soil ph is the simplest and most informative analytical technique in the diagnosis of nutrient deficiency or toxicity chang 1978 reviewed various soil and plant analyses methods to evaluate the nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfur zinc and silicon available to lowland rice from

forno et al 1975 nutrient absorption and translocation the rate of dry matter production of the rice plant the proportionate weight of each plant part and the mineral content of a given plant part change as the plant develops the causes are changes in physiological status of the plant with the development of growth phases and changes in environmental conditions such as temperature availability of each nutrient in the soil and so on during growth and development the accumulation of nitrogen in the vegetative organs is high during the early growth stages and decreases with growth after flowering translocation of nitrogen from the vegetative organs to the grains becomes significant there is some translocation of carbohydrates from the vegetative plant parts to the grains accumulation of carbohydrates in the vegetative organs is negligible during the vegetative phase and after flowering a large amount of carbohydrates accumulates in the grains during the vegetative stages protein synthesis is active during the reproduc tive stage synthesis of cell wall substances such as cellulose lignin and so on becomes active although protein synthesis also continues and during the ripening stage starch synthesis in grains becomes active nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur which are components of proteins are absorbed rapidly during vegetative growth and translocated from the vegetative organs to the grain after flowering potassium and calcium which regulate various metabolic processes are absorbed at a rate almost parallel to dry matter production but there is no marked translocation of these elements from vegetative organs to the grains during ripening magnesium is absorbed most actively during the reproductive growth and its translocation after flowering occurs to some extent ca the elements that are components of proteins have a high mobility and the elements that are continuously absorbed until the end of growth have a low mobility for example silicon which is continuously absorbed has low mobility nutrient uptake at different growth stages the process of nutrient uptake at different growth stages is a function of climate soil properties amount and method of fertilizer application and variety of the rice plant based on a number of experiments in a temperate climate ishizuka 1965 summarized nutrient uptake of elements at different growth stages nutrient mobility in the rice plant is in the sequence p n s mg k mineral nutrition 361 at the seedling stage the percentage contents of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium increased as growth progressed and then decreased after reaching maximum value the time of maximum percentage of nitrogen in the seedling differed with the amount of nutrient supplied in the main field the percentage of nitrogen in the plant decreased slightly after transplanting and then increased until the initiation of flowering after that nitrogen percentage decreased continuously until the dough stage and remained nearly constant until complete ripening the percentage of phosphorus decreased rapidly after transplanting then increased gradually and reached a high percentage at the time of the start of flowering this high percentage continued during flowering and then decreased until the dough stage this coincided with the translocation and accumulation of starch in the grain showing a close relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and phosphorus the percentage of potassium decreased gradually according to thegrowth of the plant it increased again from flowering until complete ripening the changes in the percentage of calcium were similar to those of potassium the percentage of magnesium was high from transplanting to the middle of the percentage of sulfur decreased with growth figure 103 shows the amount of nutrients absorbed by one plant in the process of growth an example of nutrient uptake of the rice plant in countries at low latitudes is tanakas 1957 1977 comparison of the pattern of nutrient uptake of ptb 10 an earlymaturing variety and bam9 a latematuring variety fig 104 for both nitrogen uptake had a distinct peak at about 37 days after transplanting but the latematuring rice had an additional peak of nitrogen uptake about 95 days after transplanting cultural practices ecological conditions and morphological differences in rice varieties account for differences in nutrient uptake between countries at different latitudes or different regions in a given country generally the difference in the nutrient uptake patterns among different duration varieties in india is similar to the differences among latitudes in japan from north to south ishizuka 1965 nitrogen requirement and yielddetermining process tillering and then decreased gradually for high rice yield optimum nitrogen nutrition is important at four growth stages they are just after rooting at the necknode differentiation stage 362 mineral nutrition and

practice in relation to nitrogen application in rice cultivation adapted from matsushima 1969 significant based on nitrogen nutrition in relation to percentage of ripened grains as well as grain yield matsushima 1969 suggested draining and flooding the field at predetermined growth stages of rice and topdressings of nitrogen fig 105 his suggestions were however developed in a temperate climate with low solar energy if solar radiation is high such as in california in the united states and southern australia or during the dry season in the tropics high yields can be obtained without practicing the widely split nitrogen application varietal response to nitrogen nitrogen nutrition plays a critical role in the rate and the duration of the dry matter production after flowering tanaka 1969 the efficacy of drymatter production depends mainly on the varietal differences in response of photo 364 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice synthetic activity to nitrogen these characteristics are reflected not only in the drymatter production as a whole but also in the percentage of ripened grains and yields murata 1969 in the field the increment of yield increase caused by nitrogen application is generally more in number of panicles than in panicle size there is a tendency for panicle size to decrease as panicle numbers increase the larger the panicle size with a highpanicleweight variety the taller the plant making the high panicleweight type of rice more prone to lodging especially at high nitrogen levels thus the nitrogen response of the highpaniclenumber type is higher than that of the high panicle weight type with the former an increase in yield can be accomplished by a heavy nitrogen application combined with dense planting absorption of phosphorus phosphorus uptake by the rice plant reaches its maximum by flowering time the translocation of phosphorus from the leaves and culms to the panicle continues until the dough stage this coincides with the translocationand accumulation of starch in the grain showing a close relationship between carbohydrate metabol ism and phosphorus ishizuka 1965 studies on phosphorus fertilization tend to get less attention because the effect of applied phosphorus on rice yield is seldom as dramatic as that of nitrogen however if phosphorus content in the soil is low rice yield will be low nutrient removal by a rice crop the analysis of various nutrient elements in rice grown in the tropics suggests that if the panicles and straw are removed from the field great amounts of silicon and significant amounts of potassium are removed if only the grains are harvested silicon removal is reduced greatly but the removal of nitrogen becomes relatively significant table 104 data from japan show that the amount of nitrogen removed by a temperate climate crop of 1268 tha is higher table 105 than that by a rice crop in a tropical country table 104 as expected removal of silicon was also high in the data from japan nutritional disorders the visible toxicity symptoms of iron aluminum manganese boron and high salt content salinity were described earlier the nutritional disorders of the rice plant that are

solution increases when the submerged soil is reduced iron toxicity occurs primarily on soils with low ph and high organic matter nutritional disorders of rice that are associated with iron toxicity are bronzing in sri lanka ponnamperuma et al 1955 akagare type i in japan baba and tajima 1960 and akiochi in the republic of korea park and tanaka 1968 the iron content is usually but not always high in plants showing bronzing which makes diagnosis of iron toxicity by the iron content of the plant questionable an interaction also exists between iron and potassium in the plant plants exhibiting bronzing symptoms are usually low in potassium tanaka and yoshida 1970 the akagare type i disorder is remedied by the application of potassium and it is therefore considered to be associated with potassium deficiency but plants affected by akagare type i are generally high in iron content leading to the belief that bronzing and akagare type i disorders may be similar iron toxicity is also a serious problem for rice grown in acid sulfate soils application of lime and phosphorus often minimizes the problem other suggestions for amelioration of iron toxicity are use of urea instead of ammonium sulfate and application of phosphorus and potassium aluminum toxicity aluminum toxicity is sometimes a problem in upland rice grown on acid soils it is also a problem on lowland soils such as the acid sulfate soils in thailand where rice is grown as an upland crop for a few weeks before the field is flooded aluminum toxicity retards root growth thereby reducing nutrient uptake and decreasing drought tolerance nutritional disorders 367 figure 106 effect of aluminum concentration in a solution culture on the aluminum phosphorus and calcium contents of shoots and roots of two rice varieties at 3 weeks after planting adapted from howeler and cadavid 1976 howeler and cadavid 1976 reported that distinct varietal differences exist in aluminum concentration in both shoots and roots when rice seedlings were grown in solution with varying aluminum concentrations for example the aluminum tolerant line colombia 1 had higher aluminum levels in the roots and lower levels in the shoots than the aluminum sensitive cica4 fig 106 this would indicate a better aluminum exclusion capacity of colombia 1 resulting in aluminum precipitation in or outside of the root and less aluminum translocation to the shoot the phosphorus contents of shoots were higher than those of roots and generally decreased with increased aluminum concentration phosphorus con 368 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice figure 107 effects of aluminum on growth of rice shoot and root length at two growth stages av of nine varieties from irri 1978a tents in both roots and shoots were consistently higher in colombia 1 than in cica 4 similarly the calcium contents in shoots were higher in colombia 1 than in cica 4 while those in the roots were not significantly different in 1977 irri initiated studies on varietal differences in tolerance for aluminum toxicity at 02 weeks after pregermination irri 1978a because both tolerance for aluminum toxicity and deep root growth are desirable for acid upland soils the studies used root length at 30 ppm aluminum to measure tolerance of rice for aluminum toxicity aluminum retarded the growth of roots more than the growth of shoots fig 107 with seedlings more susceptible to aluminum toxicity at 02 weeks old than at 25 weeks maximum and total root length were both affected in general lowland semidwarf varieties were more susceptible to aluminum toxicity than upland varieties which confirmed earlier findings of howeler and cadavid 1976 recent study of aluminum toxicity at irri yoshida 1980 unpublished suggests that aluminum reduces total root length but does not affect water uptake rate per unit root length the total amount of phosphorus absorbed by the rice plant however is closely related to total root length which in turn is affected by aluminum yoshida contends that aluminum toxicity under drought would increase plant water stress because maximum rooting depth is decreased thus aluminum toxicity is considered an important soil factor affecting drought tolerance of rice the mode of aluminum toxicity with rice growth is schematically represented in fig 108 manganese toxicity rice has a high degree of tolerance for high manganese concentration in its tissues with 3000 ppm manganese in the plant rice usually yields well the nutritional disorders 369 figure 108 schematic representation of mode of aluminum toxicity with rice growth from s yoshida irri 1980 personal communication critical tissue content for manganese toxicity was reported as 7000 ppm by cheng and ouellete 1971 tadano and yoshida 1978 suggested that a high manganese content in rice tissues is frequently associated with high yields possibly indicating that a high manganese content in the plant is associated with various favorable soil conditions boron toxicity the first evidence of boron toxicity in rice was reported by ponnamperuma and yuan 1966 on a soil in the silo region of taiwan the soil ph was 81 soil solutions of the affected flooded soils contained 91 ppm boron compared with 1 ppm boron for two normal soils from the philippines in an experiment with the taiwan soil and two soils from the philippines ponnamperuma and yuan 1966 induced foliar symptoms of boron toxicity in rice at 2060 ppm of applied boron as borax these results suggested that the critical concentration of watersoluble boron for toxicity to rice may vary from soil to soil irrigation water with boron content greater than 2 ppm causes accumulation of boron in soils see chapter 9 ponnamperuma 1979 summarized information on toxic limits of boron in a ricegrowing soil more than 3 ppm hotwatersoluble boron in soil is toxic hesse 1971 more than 2 ppm boron in irrigation water is harmful faounesco more than 2 ppm in culture solution is toxic lockard 1969 more than 15 ppm in saturated soil extract is toxic usda 1954 more than 9 ppm in the interstitial solution is toxic ponnamperuma and high potassium content aggravates boron toxicity houng 1975 1973 yuan 1966 370 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice amelioration of excess boron in soil is difficult however if irrigation water from a well has high more than 2 ppm boron content it should be diluted with surface water with less or no boron content internal drainage should also minimize accumulation of boron ponnamperuma 1979 sulfide toxicity in a highly reduced flooded soil sulfate is reduced to sulfide takai and kamura 1966 which inhibits the respiration and oxidative power of the roots and retards the uptake of various elements mitsui et al 1951 demonstrated that a hydrogen sulfide concentration as low as 007 ppm is toxic to rice on the other hand sulfides can be oxidized by the oxidizing power of the roots and thus lose their toxic effects baba 1955 takagi and okajima 1956 thus the occurrence of sulfide toxicity in rice depends on the concentration of sulfide in the soil solution and the level of oxidizing power of the rice roots hydrogen sulfide is considered the major cause of disorder of rice on degraded paddy soils sulfide toxicity occurs mainly on sandy well drained degraded paddy soils and on poorly drained organic soils tanaka and yoshida 1970 toxicity of organic acids acetic acid is generally the major organic acid produced in a rice growing soil other organic acids occurring in submerged soils are formic propionic and butyric motomura 1962 gotoh and onikura 1971 the production of organic acids is enhanced by incorporation of readily decomposable organic matter such as rice straw organic acids are reported as toxic to rice at concentrations of 10 2 10 3 m mitsui et al 1959 takijima et al 1960 observed a distinct growth retardation of rice by acetic acids at a concentration of 15 10 2 m in a submerged clay loam soil organic acids may aggravate iron toxicity in some soils tanaka and navasero 1967 depending on ph of the soil solution organic acids also appear to affect zinc uptake by rice forno et al 1975 salinity salinity is generally associated with alkalinity in inland areas where evaporation is greater than precipitation salinity is also usually associated with acidity in coastal areas the common problem in both cases is high salt concentration in the soil solution under weakly saline conditions and if sodium is the major cation and fertilizer management for rice 371 potassium is deficient the sodium may benefit rice growth by partially replacing potassium it appears that when potassium supply is high sodium is antagonistic to potassium absorption but when potassium supply is low the beneficial effect of sodium by partial replacement of potassium is more pronounced than the antagonism between the two elements as a result the presence of moderately higher concentration of sodium chloride can promote rice growth yoshida and castaeda 1969 salinity injury in rice varies with salt concentration kind of salt soil temperature variety and development stage of the crop ponnamperuma 1979 maas and hoffman 1977 described salt injury in plants by the equation y 100 b ec e a where y relative yield a salinity threshold value equal to 3 for rice b yield decrease per unit increase in salinity equal to 12 for rice ponnamperuma 1978 suggested ec e 2 ms 2 mmho cm as best for rice classification of nutritional disorders tanaka and yoshida 1970 classified nutritional disorders of rice in asia as shown in table 106 at low ph the main nutritional disorders are iron toxicity phosphorus deficiency manganese toxicity and hydrogen sulfide toxicity at high ph the nutritional disorders are phosphorus iron and zinc deficiency salinity alkalinity and boron toxicity deficiencies of phosphorus and zinc are discussed elsewhere in this chapter fertilizer management for rice from time immemorial farmers have used common sense and experience to provide nutrition to their crops they used raw organic matter human and animal manure ashes fish bone and other waste materials to make the crop plants more productive plant nutrition as a science began to develop in 1840 when the german physical chemist justus von liebig suggested that crop yields were directly related to the content of plant nutrients or mineral elements in the manure applied to the soil since liebigs revolutionary theory on mineral nutrition there has been a complete modernization of science technology and resource consumption the full benefits of that modernization are yet to be reaped in many parts of the world due to excessive population pressure on the land and lack of the necessary resourcesfertilizers and other production inputsrequired in successful agricultural development table 106 classification of nutritional disorders in asia from tanaka and yoshida 1970 soil

unit of fertilizer nutrient applied under a specific set of soil and climatic conditions recently barber 1977 defined fertilizer efficiency as the increase in yield of the harvested portion of the crop per unit of fertilizer nutrient applied for example if changing agronomic practices increase yield without changing the rate of nutrient application the efficiency of the fertilizer nutrient has increased barber emphasizes however the importance of obtaining high yields when measuring fertilizer efficiency the highest fertilizer efficiency is obtained with the first increment of fertilizer and the size of the yield increase decreases successively with each additional increment of fertilizer added therefore the lowest rate of fertilizer would give the highest efficiency but the yield obtained may be low and unprofitable the above contention is not entirely relevant to fertilization of rice in the developing world particularly in tropical asia where millions of farmers use low rates of fertilizer while learning how to maximize grain yields at high rates of fertilizer application maximization of grain yields at low rates of fertilizers should not be ignored any savings in fertilizer use and hence cost could help millions of small rice farmers another approach to defining fertilizer efficiency is based on plant uptake with the least amount of fertilizer needed to match plant use with maximum grain yield as the most efficient rate of fertilizer application bartholomew 1972 classified nitrogen need according to plant usegood use efficiency average use efficiency poor use efficiency and pollution range there are two possible reasons for not reaching expected yield levels the fertilizer nutrients are not taken up by the plants because they are applied at the wrong time or in the wrong place or transformation of nutrients has made them unavailable although taken up by the crop the nutrients are not used for grain production due to other growth limiting factors such as insufficient water or light or lack of other mineral elements several factors determine the fertilizer efficiency in rice at the farm level among them are soil crop and variety season time of planting water management weed control insect and disease control cropping sequence time of fertilizer application and fertilizer sources examples of chemical properties of common fertilizers for rice are given in table 107 for india mahapatra et al 1974 summarized fertilizer efficiency in cereals as dryseason rice wet season rice wheat maize millet sorghum in all those crops a well planned and well executed program of field research would help identify nutrient deficiencies and determine yield responses from low as well as high rates of fertilizer application table 107 some chemical

grown with improved cultural practices low nitrogen use efficiency the widespread need for nitrogen for food production the anticipated increase in fertilizer nitrogen costs and the anticipated world shortage of petroleum products all call for answers to the questions what happens to the fertilizer nitrogen not utilized by the rice crop how can fertilizer use and crop management practices be improved to conserve fertilizer nitrogen nitrogen fertilizer effectiveness numerous nitrogenresponse experiments have shown that the recovery of fertilizer nitrogen applied to the rice crop is seldom more than 3040 even with the best agronomic practices and strictly controlled conditions the recovery seldom exceeds 6065 de datta et al 1968 ironically the soil and climatic conditions that favor rice growth adversely affect the recovery of nitrogen from the soil and are responsible for its rapid loss nitrogen may be lost from plants through root exudation the flushing action of dew or rain and natural or mechanical loss of plant parts even considering all these possibilities a portion of the applied nitrogen is not accounted for recent research in the united states indicates that there is a relationship between gaseous nitrogen loss and efficiency of nitrogen utilization by rice plants these losses may need to be considered to determine nitrogen fertilizer effectiveness in rice da silva and stutte 1979 management of nitrogen fertilizers detailed studies of fertilizer use and crop management to minimize nitrogen losses and to increase the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer are needed it is imperative to examine each fertilizer material and each management practice critically in order to increase efficiency of nitrogen utilization for rice inorganic sources of nitrogen the choice of nitrogen source for flooded rice depends on the method and the time of application many farmers apply fertilizer in two and three doses with part at planting during land preparation or shortly after planting and the remainder as a topdressing during the various stages of growth the nitrogen applied at planting should be in the ammonium nh 4 form the source of 376 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice nitrogen used as topdressings is less critical nh 4 and nitrate no 3 forms appear to be equally effective this is because when the crop is fully established the no 3 form of nitrogen is rapidly taken up by the rice crop before it can be leached down to the reduced soil layer where it might be lost through denitrification this may account for the equal performance of no 3 containing fertilizers such as nh 4 no 3 as compared to any other nh 4 containing or forming n sources such as ammonium sulfate or urea numerous research reports and review articles have compared sources of fertilizer nitrogen for flooded rice in most situations ammonium containing or ammonium producing urea fertilizers are similar in effectiveness based on grain yield de datta and magnaye 1969 in some instances however different responses are obtained from urea and ammonium sulfate for example in certain problem soils low in iron such as degraded paddy soils of japan urea ammonium chloride and other nonsulfur containing fertilizer nitrogen are preferred over sulfur containing nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate without adequate iron h 2 s develops in a reduced soil and adversely affects rice plants in the presence of adequate quantities of active iron sulfur is precipitated as ferrous sulfide fes which is not toxic to rice on a sandy soil low in iron jayasekara and ariyanayagam 1962 reported a rice yield increase of 734 with urea and only 337 with ammonium sulfate experiments to evaluate six nitrogen sources for flooded rice in the united states sri lanka india japan and taiwan indicated that ammonium sulfate is as effective as ammonium chloride followed by urea and that nitrate containing fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate are least effective engelstad 1967 averages of data for 10 experiments in thailand during 19661969 ranked the effectiveness of nitrogen sources as ammonium sulfate ammonium chlo ride ammonium sulfatenitrate urea calcium ammonium nitrate the reason for the apparent poor performance of urea in some of the southeast asian experiments was not clear in many experiments yield levels and responses to nitrogen were rather low when those data were expressed in percentage form the differences among sources appeared large tests conducted in arkansas united states during 19591960 indicated no differences among urea ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride topdressed in a two split application these results further confirm the contention that nitrogen source is of minor importance for topdressings during the growing season anhydrous ammonia is agronomically equal in effectiveness to ammonium sulfate but its use in small paddies is prohibited by lack of suitable machines for its application it is apparent that urea is the principal nitrogen fertilizer for rice and will remain so in tropical asia urea is the highest nitrogen containing solid fertilizer material commercially available and its high analysis permits considerable savings in shipping and distribution costs these factors have made urea attractive to a large number of farmers and fertilizer manufacturers figure 109 nitrogen 377 figure 109 changes in capacity to produce major nitrogen products 19721985 from tennessee valley authority and international fertilizer development center unpublished data shows the trend in production of nitrogen fertilizers in continental asia and the world slowrelease nitrogen sources fertilizer shortages plus the heavy losses of fertilizer nitrogen in rice fields when application rates are high as in the case of modern rice varieties have led fertilizer technologists to develop fertilizer materials for more efficient use 378 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice there are a number of proved or potential advantages of fertilizers that release their plant nutrients slowly throughout the growing season or longer these slowrelease fertilizers offer potential for increasing fertilizer efficiency de creasing cost of application due to fewer applications minimizing losses by leaching fixation or decomposition eliminating or at least minimizing luxury consumption and avoiding damage to seedlings slow release fertilizers to provide nitrogen that roughly coincides with that required by growing plants are made by synthesis of chemical compounds with inherently slow rates of dissolution coating of conventional soluble fertilizers to reduce their dissolution rates most of the slow release fertilizers are condensation products of urea and aldehydes horn 1979 reviewed various slow release nitrogen sources that are relevant in lowland rice five slow release urea fertilizers tested for rice are 1 ureaform urea formaldehyde which was first developed in the united states for turf grasses and ornamental plants ureaform is a generic term that covers a host of products that are mixtures of methylene ureas they range from short chain water soluble molecules to long chain water insoluble molecules the completely insoluble ureaforms are of no agronomic significance but those of higher solubility are of great importance 2 ibdu isobutylidene diurea which is a condensation product of urea and isobutyl aldehyde developed in japan it is now commercially manufactured and available in the japanese markets nitrogen release from ibdu is generally controlled by granule size 3 cdu crotonylidene diurea which was prepared by the acid catalysis of urea and acetaldehyde it was first manufactured in germany and is now a commercial product in japan 4 scu sulfur coated urea which was first developed by the tennessee valley authority tva in the united states by using sulfur a microcrystalline soft sealant and a microbicide the porous nature of the sulfur coating was avoided by using a sealant that prevents rapid transfer of moisture through the coating stangel 1970 the release rate of nitrogen is controlled by varying the thickness of sulfur and sealant coating urea granules must have about the same thickness of coating on them regardless of their size to give the same dissolution rates the granules should be spherical and have a smooth surface if they do not they are much more difficult to coat completely and effectively with sulfur a mixture of polyethylene and bright stock oil is now used instead of wax to seal the sulfur coating in the conventional process diatomaceous earth has been used as a conditioner because of its oil absorbing properties it is applied at about 2 of the total product weight nitrogen 379 5 sulfur coated supergranules which were developed by the international fertilizer development center ifdc both supergranules of urea and sulfur coated supergranules were produced for testing in asian rice culture sulfur coated supergranules were developed to combine the concept of deep placement and slow release nitrogen fertilizer in increasing fertilizer nitrogen efficiency in lowland rice agronomic significance of controlled release fertilizers field experiments in japan showed that a single dose of ibdu gave 20 more rice than ammonium sulfate applied in split application and 25 more yield than ammonium sulfate applied in a single basal dressing hamamoto 1966 results with ibdu in india and the philippines were equally promising prasad and de datta 1979 in field experiments during 1967 1972 in the united states wells and shockley 1975 also observed that ibdu was a suitable nitrogen source for rice of the coated fertilizers sulfur coated urea scu has been most widely tested on many crops including rice in many countries the crop response to scu was generally superior to the response to urea in a single basal application and often superior to split application at the same nitrogen rate experiments with scu in india have given excellent results for example in experiments conducted by the all india coordinated rice improvement project aicrip scu gave 25 30 kg grain kg nitrogen compared with 16 20 kg grainkg nitrogen with urea applied as a split application prasad and de datta 1979 results from 41 experiments in seven countries showed that scu produced 6 more kg grain kg n than urea table 108 during 1975 irri initiated an informal collaborative program on fertilizer efficiency in rice in 10 countries in asia collaborative programs on

2 of the trials scu gave a significantly lower yield and in 68 of trials no significant differences in grain yield table 109 in 1978 the network name was changed to international network on soil fertility and fertilizer evaluation for rice insffer to include management of soil fertility through the use of biological nitrogen fixation including use of azolla continuous flooding with good water control is the exception rather than the rule for rice paddies in the tropics often flooding is either delayed or intermittent after fertilizer application the advantages of scu have been most obvious in soils with intermittent flooding and drying under such conditions in peru it was possible to produce the same crop yield with only 40 as much nitrogen as scu as with urea sanchez et al 1973 in indonesia scu was superior to three applications of urea under intermittent flooding but under constant flooding nitrogen 381 yields with scu and three applications of urea were more often equal de datta 1978 in the united states the use of scu did not result in increased rice production or higher nitrogen efficiency in comparison with split applications of regular fertilizer grade urea westfall

nitrogen lost from rice fields may be lost after the nitrification of amide and ammonium nitrogen to nitrates nitrification inhibitors have been tested to minimize such losses in almost all cases the inhibitor is intended to block the conversion of ammonium nitrogen to nitrate by inhibiting nitrosomonas growth or activity fig 1010 four examples of nitrification inhibitors and their chemical characteristics are 1 nitrapyrin 2 chloro 6trichloromethylpyridine which was developed in the united states is possibly the most widely tested of all nitrification inhibitors nitrapyrin persists and is effective in the soil for as long as 6 weeks effectiveness of nitrapyrin declines as soil temperature increases nitrapyrin is recommended for banding with a nitrogen fertilizer 2 dicyandiamide which is sold commercially in japan the nitrification inhibitory effects of dicyandiamide have been reported at concentrations of 510 of ammonium n like nitrapyrin its effectiveness declines with the increase in soil temperature 3 am 2amino4 chloro6methyl pyrimidine which was developed in japan has been proven to be effective at a concentration of 2 ppm increase in temperature greatly reduces its effectiveness which reduces its potential for tropical conditions 4 st 2 sulfanilamidiothiazole which was developed by the same japanese concern that produced am st has been claimed to have overcome the problems of am st can be mixed with acid fertilizers and can be readily formulated with compound fertilizers figure 1010 the coatedgranule inhibitor approach adapted from stangel 1970 382 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice agronomic significance of nitrification inhibitors in laboratory stud ies several chemicals such as nitrapyrin am dicyandiamide thiourea st potassium azide and some sulfur chemicals have effectively retarded nitrifica tion the effectiveness of inhibitors in the field has been less clear field experiments in india and in japan showed the benefits of the urea treatment over ammonium sulfate with a nitrification inhibitor but research in the united states turner 1977 failed to obtain a significant increase in rice yield attributable to the same nitrification inhibitor treatment recently however in 2 years of field testing in arkansas a nitrogen stabilizer containing nitrapyrin and urea fertilizer applied on starbonnet rice growing on a crowley silt loam soil showed increased grain yields plant height and nitrogen uptake when compared to equivalent rates of urea alone wells 1977 in india in tests of indigenous materials with nitrification inhibiting pro perties a 22 increase in rice yield was found due to treatment of urea with an acetone extract of neem azadirachta indica a juss kernels because the acetone also extracts the oil which can be utilized for medicinal purposes or for making soap later studies were made with the cake after the extraction of the oil an increase of 24 in rice yield was obtained by applying urea mixed with 20 by weight of neem cake neem cake appears to hold considerable promise for increasing the efficiency of nitrogen applied to rice prasad and de datta 1979 the actual chemical compounds responsible for nitrification inhibitory properties in neem kernels have yet to be identified organic sources of nitrogen management of straw and other organic sources of nitrogen has received considerable attention their use has been influenced by two main factors the fear that continuous application of certain inorganic nitrogen fertilizers although they may give better yields in the first few years can increase soil acidity and cause appreciable deterioration in soil productivity the belief that compost and organic sources of nitrogen are essential for obtaining high yield the fear of soil acidity due to continuous application of inorganic nitrogen is particularly true if ammonium sulfate is used alone for a long time repeated applications of ammonium chloride in areas of high rainfall are believed to promote removal of calcium magnesium and phosphorus and gradually make the soil more acid digar 1958 however did not observeany detrimentaleffect on rice yield or changes in soil characteristics even after 10 years of continuous application of ammonium sulfate in japan compost was a major factor for farmers in yield contests during 19481968 contest winning farmers obtained an average of 112 tha 9 t brown riceha with the highest record of 131 tha 105 t brown rice ha by using compost as a supplement to inorganic fertilizers the average amount of nitrogen 383 compost used by the contest winners was 18 tha but some farmers used as much as 30 t ha intensive use of compost in rice fields in japan reached a peak about 1955 and then decreased steadily because of abundance of inexpensive nitrogen fertilizers tanaka 1978 the average use of compost was 65 t ha in 1955 and 45 t ha in 1970 the returns from chemical fertilizers became highly attractive while handling of rice straw for making rice straw compost became expensive because of the high cost of labor for making compost today many farmers in japan burn their straw in the fields others incorporate it to minimize the cost of handling and avoid airpollution problems caused by burning in china compost and other organic nitrogen sources are used with inorganic fertilizers primarily nh 4 hco 3 in general compost and other organic sources are applied as a basal dressing swine manure is extensively used despite the fact that many large fertilizer plants are completed or scheduled to be completed soon the recycling of organic waste will continue to play an important role in rice production in china in the republic of korea use of compost has steadily declined over the years because of high labor cost however farmers are still encouraged to make compost for rice fields with compost and inorganic use of fertilizer providing at least 150 kg n ha korean farmers have achieved average national rice yields close to 7 t ha see chapter 6 the experiences of temperate east asia indicate that dependence on compost and other organic sources of nitrogen declines with increased industrialization and associated high cost of labor rather than because of any decline of rice yields from continuous use of inorganic fertilizer in rice in tropical asia with increased availability of urea and other nitrogenous fertilizers and with greater use of short stiffstrawed nitrogenresponsive rice varieties the use of organic sources of nitrogen provides a supplement rather than an alternative to inorganic fertilizers for lowland rice nevertheless because of fears of inorganic fertilizers deleterious effects on soil productivity and farmers inability to purchase inorganic fertilizers organic sources of nitrogen for rice are being used in some tropical asian countries in india 2200 million tons of compostable waste generated annually contribute about 22 million tons of plant nutrients with increased emphasis on cropping intensity organic sources of nitrogen fertilizers even in the developing countries of the asian tropics should remain as an important supplemental source of nutrients nature of organic nitrogen sources rice straw consists of organic substances such as cellulose hemicellulose pectin lignin proteins and so on and mineral elements such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium silicon and sulfur when straw is burned all organic substances and a large portion of nitrogen and sulfur in the straw are lost and the other elements remain in the ash the composition of rice straw and compost prepared from it will vary greatly depending on the availability of plant nutrients in the soil on which rice and other 384 mineral nutrition and fertilizer

the wu shi area droppings of swine sheep and rabbits are used to make compost the farmyard manure is mixed with silt and the mixture is allowed to decompose in the hsu han peoples commune in ja din

extensive use is made of water hyacinth for swine feed and as a material for compost green manure in many countries green manure is regarded as an important nutrient source for rice it is useful where organic sources such as compost and inorganic fertilizers are lacking the adoption of the green manure practice is largely determined by the alternatives available to provide nitrogen and organic matter and the resources of rice farmers in some instances green manure will be used because inorganic nitrogen is expensive in other instances land may be better used to grow green manure rather than left idle india is the country where research and use of green manures have received the greatest attention excellent results with green manure have been reported from india bangladesh indonesia and china in many areas of china green manure crops such as sesbania sp and crotalaria sp are grown to improve soil fertility in areas where lowland rice is to be followed by an upland crop the green manure crop is grown before the upland crop to improve soil structure in hua county vetch is grown during winter primarily for green manure the distinct benefits of green manure crops to soil fertility are that they provide organic matter and nitrogen green manuring however has the distinct disadvantage of using land and water that otherwise could be used for a crop of 386 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice rice or other food crop the requirement of adequate levels of phosphorus and to some extent calcium and potassium also raises serious questions regarding the use of green manure crops under most ricegrowing situations in the world nevertheless green manuring will be practiced in india and some other countries until fertilizer supply and prices are within the reach of small farmers in some countries land is used for a green manure crop simply because other food or feed crops cannot be grown otherwise in those situations green manure improves soil fertility and physical properties green manure crops many plant species are grown as green manures the most common green manure crops in india are crotalaria juncea l sesbania bispinosa jacq w f

leaves incorporated into the rice fields gliricidia sepium jacq kunth ex walp and leucaena leucocephala lam de wit are excellent species for production of green leaves two factors are critical to the success of green manure production one is the stage of the crop when it is ready for incorporation incorporation of the crop too early or too late gives less than the full potential of the green manure crop the best time to incorporate a crop is when it is about to flowerabout 8 weeks after seeding for most crops the time of incorporation of a green manure crop depends on the growth stage of the crop if harvested at the optimum time of about 8 weeks after seeding a green manure crop can be incorporated just before planting of a rice crop but an older woody green manure crop should be turned under earlier because it requires more time for decomposition in california vetch containing 34 nitrogen is a highly effective and inexpensive source of nitrogen if the crop is properly incorporated and the soil promptly flooded purple vetch capitalizes on the mild moist winters of california and does well in areas without irrigation where the annual rainfall is 375 mm or more vetch is broadcast in the fully prepared field in october and harrowed in the green manure crop is turned into the soil by disking or plowing in the spring during land preparation for rice in texas a suitable rotation with sesbania species has been beneficial in rotation with rice rice yields increased 20 or more lespedeza cuneata dum g don could be established by broadcasting the seed in rice stubble in late february or early march it is apparent that the shortterm benefit of a green manure crop is its contribution as a source of nitrogen deep incorporation of green manure is desirable to minimize nitrogen losses in gaseous forms in california significant nitrogen losses occurred when vetch was incorporated less than 10 cm deep timing of nitrogen application if the crop absorbs a high proportion of the nutrients added as a fertilizer fertilizer efficiency automatically increases this means fertilizer efficiency can be increased by getting higher yields with the same amount of nutrient absorbed by the plant one way to achieve this is to apply the fertilizer at a time to best meet the demand of the rice plant rice plants of medium growth duration 145 days when grown at low nitrogen levels about 20 kgha use fertilizer most efficiently for grain production during the maximum tillering stage and around the flowering stage between the booting and milk stages a high nitrogen supply tends to decrease 388 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice the number of filled spikelets and the weight of 1000 grains therefore split application of nitrogen with one dose at transplanting and another at panicle initiation is best for obtaining high grain yields particularly in the case of mediumand longseason varieties nitrogen absorbed by the plant from tillering to panicle initiation tends to increase the number of tillers and panicles and that absorbed during panicle development from panicle initiation to flowering increases the number of filled spikelets per panicle nitrogen absorbed after flowering tends to increase the 1000grain weight de datta 1978 in a directsowing experiment yanagisawa et al 1967 observed that nitrogen applied at panicle initiation or at flowering reduced the rate of senescence of the lower leaves probably as a result of a reduction in the amount of nitrogen that was translocated from the lower to the upper leaves nitrogen uptake in relation to time of nitrogen fertilization has been studied extensively in japan if various rates of nitrogen are applied as a basal dressing nitrogen uptake is progressively increased at different growth stages fig 1012 it was further reported that in the hokkaido environment which is cool during the ricegrowing season the desired high grain yields could not be obtained by increasing nitrogen rates as a basal dressing shiga et al 1977 the effect of nitrogen topdressing at the early panicle initiation stage on the patterns of nitrogen uptake by rice plants almost resembled that of a high level of basal dressing of nitrogen the spikelet number increased but the percentage of ripened grain decreased lodging of rice plants sometimes occurred even when topdressing was 30 kg n ha the authors shiga et al 1977 concluded that the topdressing of nitrogen at an early panicle initiation stage is inadequate for obtaining high grain yields in hokkaido figure 1012 nitrogen uptake by rice plants at successive growth stages from different levels of basal dressing of nitrogen 1972 adapted from shiga et al 1977 nitrogen 389 the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer uptake at different times of application can be determined by tracer techniques in an experiment by yanagisawa et al 1967 in japan 55 of the nitrogen applied 15 days before heading was used by the plant at flowering use was 49 at tillering 34 and at transplanting as a basal dressing 7 in another study the application of two thirds of the nitrogen at transplanting and the remaining one third at the booting stage gave higher nitrogen recovery 51 than when the entire amount was applied at transplant ing 38 or when topdressed at the tillering stage 32 studies in california showed that 18 of tracer 15 n was absorbed when the nitrogen was topdressed at maximum tillering and 45 when topdressed at the booting stage patnaik and broadbent 1967 studies at irri using 15 nlabeled fertilizer demonstrated that there is no advantage to a split application of nitrogen if the variety is lodgingresistant and is grown on a fertile heavy clay soil on the other hand split applications of nitrogen may result in significantly higher yields if the soil is not highly fertile and if the variety has a long growth duration in such instances split applications may prevent excessive vegetative growth and early lodging de datta et al 1969 since the introduction of modern varieties in the asian tropics in the mid 1960s interest in proper timing of nitrogen fertilizers has greatly increased recent concern about high fertilizer prices has increased interest in efficient use of fertilizer by proper management including optimum timing of nitrogen application with decreased rates of fertilizer nitrogen time of nitrogen applications becomes critical for example in a dryseason trial at irri it was shown that the highest efficiency of nitrogen use for two modern rice varieties with medium maturity requirement 124127 days was from fertilizer nitrogen at half of the optimum rate 60 kg n ha applied just before panicle initiation a shorterseason rice showed highest efficiency after basal application but responded well to the nitrogen applied just before panicle initiation fig 1013 when properly timed split applications of nitrogen fertilizer gave higher yields than when all the fertilizer was applied as basal treatment more recent studies in india and in the philippines suggest that two to three applications of nitrogen per crop gives highest nitrogen efficiency and that more split applications are needed for longduration varieties and for lighter soils prasad and de datta 1979 coarsetextured soils usually have high percolation rates and also high nitrogen losses by leaching and volatilization on such soils split applications of nitrogen usually two or three are usually recommended finertextured soils require fewer nitrogen applications provided good water management practices are followed among the 84 trials conducted within the infer program 77 showed significant response to nitrogen fertilizer in many of those trials yield responses from split application of urea nitrogen were similar to those from scu and other methods of application liquid band placement placement of mudballs and briquettes see table 109 that indicates that if urea fertilizer nitrogen is 390 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice figure 1013 efficiency kg ricekg n of 60 kg nha as urea applied in a single dose at different times to three rice varieties irri 1974 dry season from de datta et al 1974 applied at the proper time there is considerable room for improving its efficiency irri 1978b it is clear that more research is needed to determine precisely the optimum timing of nitrogen application time of nitrogen application in mechanized rice culture in the united states nitrogen for rice is used at somewhat higher rates in arkansas than in the other southern states mikkelsen and evatt 1973 rates of more than 100 kgha are fairly common some differences in the fertilizer requirements of rice varieties are recognized with the stiffer strawed varieties being capable of using higher rates of nitrogen than lodging susceptible varieties most rice farmers in nitrogen 391 louisiana and texas prefer somewhat earlier application of the total amount of fertilizer than farmers in arkansas and mississippi thompson et al 1962 results on time of nitrogen application in the united states vary with the rice growing states in arkansas the typical united states varieties such as zenith nato and bluebonnet 50 produced high yields when fertilized 4560 days before heading indicating that if properly timed with the reproductive cycle of the plant nitrogen application could increase the number of florets and eventually produce high grain yields hall 1965 sims 1965 found that low rates of nitrogen are effective when applied in a single dose just before panicle initiation he observed that under conditions of high soil fertility nitrogen should be topdressed either during the early stages of crop growth or not at all in the case of varieties similar to bluebonnet 50 a system of timing midseason nitrogen application based on plant develop ment has been used in mechanized rice culture in the united states to minimize lodging and disease the proper time to make the midseason nitrogen application is determined by cutting the main stems of representative rice plants and measuring the length of the elongated internodes optimum internode lengths for nitrogen application vary according to variety normally if the midseason nitrogen rate is 45 kgha onehalf is applied at the proper internode length for the variety and the remainder 1014 days later timing of midseason nitrogen application is highly critical for some varieties huey 1977 nitrogen applied too early will increase lodging applying nitrogen too late will be less beneficial to yield and may delay maturity results in arkansas suggest that it is possible to estimate the optimum time for applying midseason nitrogen by accumulating growing degree days dd50 from time of emergence to time of nitrogen application downey et al 1976 for california mikkelsen et al 1967 reported that although topdressing with nitrogen supplements the nitrogen supply it cannot be used as a substitute for an application before planting they reported that topdressing should be done at early growth stages 3040 days and not 60 days after seeding although the latter seemed to improve the appearance of the crop where application of nitrogen to the seedbed was not sufficient to maintain normal color and growth of rice supplementalapplications have been profitable for effective use of topdressed nitrogen on california rice varieties the application should be made no later than the jointing stage mikkelsen and evatt 1973 recent experiments in california with the new varieties esd 71 m9 and m7 confirm earlier results with old varietiespreplant nitrogen applications are most efficient in mechanized rice cultivation however nitrogen application in split doses with twothirds preplant and onethird topdressed near panicle initiation provides similar efficiency when nearoptimum or excessive nitrogen rates are applied when suboptimum nitrogen rates are applied the preplant application provides the greatest yield and the maximum efficiency university of california and united states department of agriculture 1978 results from texas were somewhat different than those from california in 392 mineral nutrition and

nitrogen may be effectively applied in a single application evatt and hodges 1975 however suggested that if nitrogen is applied in a single dose considerable blending with other nutrients is necessary before it is applied to the soil application of significant amounts of nitrogen at the time of first permanent flood establishment 24 weeks after seedling emergence is a common practice in louisiana because it takes 510 days to flood a large field a loss in effectiveness occurs due to leaving urea on the soil surface for several days recent results suggest that applying urea fertilizer to a dry soil surface up to 7 days prior to establishing a permanent flood is superior to broadcasting urea into standing water increased plant height lodging and in some cases grain yields indicate increased plant uptake of fertilizer nitrogen table 1012 methods of nitrogen application since the classical work of shioiri 1941 on denitrification losses of nitrogen from flooded rice soils placement of nitrogen in the reduced soil layer has been considered the best method to decrease nitrogen losses and increase fertilizer nitrogen efficiency in lowland rice the early history of the deep placement concept developed in japan was recently reviewed by mitsui 1977 based on the shioiri concept of deep placement of fertilizer nitrogen subsequent research in india vachhani 1952 indicated higher efficiency by deep placement of nitrogen fertilizers a field experiment at irri using 15 nlabeled nitrogen 393 table 1013 effect of placement of nitrogen and other methods of application on the grain

floodwater by airplane after seeding fertilizer placement work of mikkelsen and finfrock 1957 demonstrated that nitrogen broadcast on the soil surface or applied to the flooded fields was not used efficiently by rice however ammonia nitrogen drilled 510 cm into the soil where reducing conditions developed 35 days after flooding remained in the soil and was continuously available to the rice plants efforts to increase nitrogen fertilizer efficiency by deep placement were continued using labeled n results from experiments from different countries iaea 1970 were similar to the early work in japan shioiri 1941 and irri de datta et al 1968 using nonlabeled n fertilizer prasad and de datta 1979 reported that deep placement was superior to broadcast application for both grain yield and nitrogen uptake use of pellets and nitrogen placement gave similar grain yields but more of the applied nitrogen was recovered from the pellet application application of nitrogen in mudballs is a technique developed by the japanese that has received considerable attention in recent years in tests at irri yields obtained with 60 kg nha applied as mudballs in the reduced soil layer and those obtained with 100 kg nha applied in split application were comparable de datta 1978 in infer trials irri 1978b in 11 countries during the dry and wet seasons of 19751977 7 of 84 trials showed no significant response to nitrogen in the remaining 67 trials where positive nitrogen response was observed mudball placement gave the best performance in the dry season with a low nitrogen rate 50 kg n ha the mudballed urea was superior to the best split application in 57 of the trials and was comparable to the split application in 43 see table 394 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice 109 in no case did the mudballs give a poorer performance than the best split application with a medium nitrogen rate 84 kg n ha the percentage of trials where the mudballed urea was superior to the best split application was reduced from 57 to 38 in 5 of the trials mudballed urea had poorer performance than the best split application however the labor required to make mudballs and apply them is a deterrent to the extension of this technique it is practical mainly for small farmers with abundant family labor the concept of placement of fertilizer in the soil is becoming more relevant since the introduction of modified urea materials such as urea briquettes and urea supergranules in the infer trials irri 1978b placement of urea briquettes gave significantly higher grain yield over the best split application in the range of 18 27 of the trials table 109 briquettes are clearly economically superior to mudballs because they do not require farm labor for manufacturing economic analysis of the infer data suggested that the extra yield associated with placement of briquettes would give a return of 7 or more per dollar extra cost in countries with wage rates of 070day or lower irri 1978b foliar application of nitrogen fertilizer is another method that has received attention however a large number of trials by aicrip in india indicated that foliar application of nitrogen did not compete favorably with soil application at irri foliar application of urea in split doses did not give favorable results over conventional methods of application de datta 1978 plow sole application of fertilizer which combines primary tillage and deep placement of nitrogen fertilizer showed promise in recent irri experiments irri 1978a complementary practices for increasing fertilizer nitrogen efficiency removal of weeds and insects manipulation of plant density and management of water are examples of management practices that help improve the efficiency of fertilizer nitrogen in rice weed control the response of rice to nitrogen fertilizer is markedly influenced by the adequacy of weed control experiments in farmers fields in the philippines indicate that if weeds are not controlled adequately fertilizer should not be applied likewise without the control of insects and diseases little response from nitrogen can be expected de datta 1978 plant density nitrogen increases tiller numbers in rice thus applied nitrogen fertilizer influences the effect of plant density on rice yield irri experiments demonstrated that with no added fertilizer nitrogen rice yield increased progressively with increased plant density because high plant density tends to compensate for the adverse effects on yield of low tiller number with low soil fertility fig 1014 the results indicate that changes in plant geometry have potential for increasing fertilizer nitrogen efficiency particularly at low levels of applied nitrogen fertilizer figure 1014 effects of rates of nitrogen fertilizer application on yield response to plant density of ir36 and ir26 rices ns not significant at 5 significant at 5 significant at 1 level by t test irri 1976 wet and 1977 dry seasons from nguu and de datta 1979 395 396 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice in the asian tropics it is important to exploit natural soil fertility and to maximize grain yield at a low solar energy level during the wet season when most of the rice is grown increasing the plant density of earlymaturing rices may improve grain yield and the efficiency of rice plants to use fertilizer nitrogen hence the level of applied fertilizer nitrogen could be decreased without affecting the yield of lowland tropical rice water management water management may directly affect the efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer by lowland rice this is because water regime of a soil has a profound effect on nitrogen transformations in the soil furthermore the water regime determines the oxidationreduction potential of the soil which in turn regulates nitrification and denitrification in the rainfed rice crop the moisture regime is often not ideal for efficient nitrogen use however if rain water provides adequate moisture the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer should be identical to that in an irrigated crop provided no other factors such as insects diseases and weeds limit grain yield experiments in a farmers field in nueva ecija province philippines demonstrated that nitrogen response in irrigated rice is greater than rainfed rice similarly a recent survey made by irri economists indicated that nitrogenand water levels were the two major factors constraining yields of rice in some tropical asian countries it is therefore important that water control should be improved as much as possible in order to increase fertilizer nitrogen efficiency in lowland rice drainage may directly affect the efficiency of nitrogen utilization by lowland rice it is generally believed that temporary drainage is necessary when topdressing with nitrogen to bring fertilizer material as close to the soil particles as possible experimental results however suggest that temporary drainage for topdressing of nitrogen is not essential de datta et al 1969 the above data emphasize the interaction of fertilizer nitrogen response with good agronomic practices adequate weed insect and disease control coupled with proper management of water will increase yield response to fertilizer nitrogen and even make soil nitrogen more available to plants management of nitrogen and levels of solar radiation it is known that nitrogen response in rice varies considerably with the level of solar energy which varies widely over the year and to a lesser extent from year to year during the ripening period of the crop the intensity of solar energy during an average day in the monsoonal tropics is about 350 cal cm 2 per day which is similar to the values reported during the ricegrowing season in japan these yeartoyear variations within the same dateofharvest range have profound effects on the nitrogen response of rice varieties using data from 12 crops grown on experiments during 19681969 de datta and zarate 1970 found correlation between grain yield and irradiance ranging from 50 to 77 during the 45 days before maturity which includes about 15 days before flowering in 12 harvests of four

ripening period was 22 kcal cm 2 per month or higher these data suggest that at that solar energy level the maximum grain yield was not reached at 120 kg n ha figure 1015 shows the effects of solar radiation on yield response of rice varieties at different levels of nitrogen phosphorus rice like any other cereal requires a considerable quantity of phosphorus for vigorous growth and high grain yield phosphorus deficiency occurs on millions of hectares of ultisols oxisols acid sulfate soils ando soils inceptisols vertisols and certain inceptisols not only are these soils low in available phosphorus but they also fix fertilizer phosphorus in highly insoluble forms 398 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice besides the increase in availability of phosphorus brought about by soil submergence is slight in these soils management of phosphorus fertilizers management of phosphorus is largely dependent on soil characteristics such as soil reaction degree of weathering kind of clay minerals water regime cropping intensity and cropping patterns previously flooded soils showed greater phosphorus sorption capacity than their nonflooded soil counterparts data from australia suggest that soils that had previously grown flooded rice required more phosphorus for upland cropping than soil that had previously grown a crop such as maize willet et al 1978 sources of phosphorus except in extremely acid or alkaline soils few significant differences have been found among the effects of various phosphorus sources in lowland rice india pakistan the philippines the republic of korea and burma use super phosphate as their primary source of phosphorus on most soils but sri lanka malaysia thailand khmer republic and vietnam use phosphate rock on acid soils of south and southeast asia phosphate rock has been applied directly for rice phosphate rock is priced lower than acidulated phosphates and can reduce fertilizer cost where transport costs are not too high in experiments at the tennessee valley authority tva and in fields of thailand several phosphate rocks with varying citrate solubility were evaluated a procedure was developed that enabled a choice of phosphorus source on the basis of both agronomic effectiveness and prices of phosphorus in triple superphosphate tsp vs phosphate rocks fig 1016 experiments by irri on buenavista clay ph 60 organic matter 0813 cec 2030 meq100 g soil demonstrated that ureaammonium phosphate with various np ratios was as effective as superphosphate in lowland rice whereas florida ground phosphate rock was a poor source of phosphorus a method ology has been developed through the use of chemicals and physical character ization of a representative sample for specific property with which the agronomic effectiveness of a particular rock source can be predicted without going through extensive agronomic field trials tv a researchers have extended this work to classify several rocks as to their probable effectiveness fig 1017 the major sources of phosphorus for rice in the united states are ordinary superphosphate concentrated superphosphate ammoniated superphosphate and the ammonium phosphates mikkelsen and evatt 1973 modification of phosphorus fertilizers considering that the produc tion of finished phosphate requires seven to eight times as much energy as phosphate rock for direct application it seems certain that some changes in phosphorus 399 figure 1016 relationship between the price ratios of triple superphosphate tsp and phosphate rock and relative agronomic effectiveness values rae rae can be used in making a choice between these sources adapted from engelstad et al 1974 phosphate processing are likely to occur these will be aimed specifically at supplying the farmer a suitable phosphate product with minimal investments in energy capital for processing and contribution to the pollution problem there are a number of disadvantages of making direct application of phosphate rock a major one is that to be effective phosphate rocks must pass a 200mm sieve 53 microns which presents real problems in handling at all levels several modifications of phosphate rocks have been suggested to increase its effectiveness and ease of handling in these efforts the international fertilizer development center ifdc and tva have cooperated to develop appropriate fertilizers for all crops including rice small phosphate rock particles 60140 mesh called minigranules can be applied without the dust problem phosphate slurry is another possibility for direct application ironaluminum phosphate ores such as those from senegal and christmas island can be calcined heated to produce useful phosphorus fertilizers such products while limited in supply have proven fairly effective on crops grown on high ph soils such fertilizer materials are being agronomically evaluated for rice on high ph soils other possible sources are fused magnesium phosphate

application can be made provided it is not later than the time of active tillering early application of phosphorus is essential for root elongation phosphorus applied during the tillering stage is not efficiently used for grain production split application of phosphorus has not been proven of value because there is a great mobility of phosphorus from old leaves to young ones because the availability of soil phosphorus increases with time during submergence and because leaching losses are low chang 1976 method of application despite the greater availability of phosphorus in a lowland soil the recovery of fertilizer phosphorus by rice is generally less than 10 where extensive phosphorus 401 fertilization is practiced in the rice growing areas phosphorus is usually applied as a basal dressing it is usually broadcast with or without mixing with the surface mud either during final land preparation or puddling or immediately before sowing or transplanting table 1014 research on methods of fertilizer phosphorus application is limited in india international rice commission 1961 field experiments during 19541957 compared various methods of application of ammonium phosphate and triple superphosphate at rates of 1020 kg ha the methods tested were broadcasting at puddling immediately before planting drilling at puddling before planting dipping the seedlings in a slush of mud with phosphorus application in a pellet form prepared by mixing soil with five to ten times the fertilizer and making into small balls applied 58 cm deep in the soil and 30 cm apart between rows 34 weeks after transplanting pellet application was consistently superior to other methods of application in two stations but other stations found no significant difference among different met hods in the united states where rice is drilled in dry soil fertilizer is applied by drilling bands at seeding or broadcasting immediately after seeding the method and time of application of phosphorus fertilizers to rice in the united states are important because phosphorus stimulates grassy weeds because shallow water does not suppress germination and growth of grass seedlings it is recommended that phosphorus fertilizers should not be broadcast before seeding on dry soil if the rice is drilled phosphorus fertilizers may be applied through the soil under the drill rows the effects of placement of phosphorus fertilizer in the soil are not clear muirhead et al 1975 however showed that maize and sunflower grown in table 1014 relative efficiency of various phosphorus placement methods

fertilizer management of rice previous rice fields responded markedly to phosphorus fertilizer banded 10 cm below the seeds but the response was not to the same extent as for fertilizer mixed with the surface 10 cm this contrast in responses is characteristic of soils with high capacity to immobilize phosphorus later studies by willet et al 1978 suggested that phosphorus sorption was significantly positively correlated with percentage of phosphorus in the plant derived from the fertilizer but was not correlated with yield response to phosphorus with different methods of application potassium generally the response of rice to potassium added to the soil is not as marked as for nitrogen or phosphorus there are reports that most rice soils in asia do not need potassium as much as nitrogen or phosphorus and that only a small and variable increase in rice yield is obtained with addition of potassium fertilizer although a large percentage of 566 experiments in the republic of korea showed positive response to potassium fertilizers the actual increase in yield was about 4 oh and kim 1964 three trials in india yielded no significant difference in grain yield obtained with potassium additions the rice requirement of potassium is sometimes supplied from plant residues turned under and from potassium in irrigation water but india has rice growing soils in the high rainfall areas that are deficient in potassium those soils are in decreasing order of deficiency the yellow coastal alluvium mixed red and black laterite groups goswami et al 1976 data from 665 agronomic trials in farmers fields throughout india demon strate that the highest potassium response about 14 tha was obtained with 60 kg k 2o ha on red sandy or loamy soils because of those soils lighter texture losses of potassium were substantial favorable response of rice to potassium has been obtained on sandy and coarse textured soils in vietnam sri lanka and malaysia thenabadu 1973 reported that more than 75 of the rice soils in the wet zone of sri lanka have a potassium content of less than 015 meq100 g of soil and soils in the intermediate zone as well as the boggy and peat soils are deficient in potassium in thailand most rice growing soils have moderate levels of exchangeable potassium except in the khorat regions where the levels of exchangeable potassium are very low most rice growing soils in the philippines are geologically young and release considerable potassium from weathering of primary minerals nevertheless under continuous cropping with modern rice varieties potassium response is becoming increasingly apparent in many lowland soils de datta and gomez 1975 the average increase in yield in taiwan due to potassium is about 50 responses are most significant on red and yellow earths and the effect of potassium is generally greater in the second crop than in the first potassium 403 management of potassium fertilizer compared with nitrogen phosphorus and zinc response to potassium in rice has been limited furthermore management of potassium fertilizer is simpler than the management of nitrogen sources of potassium potassium fertilizers are obtained by mining and purifying natural deposits like sylvinite halite and sylvite carnallite kainite and langbeinite of these more than 90 of the estimated world potassium resources occur as bedded potassium deposits principally sylvinite and carnallite potassium chloride is the principal fertilizer source for potassium application to rice because of its low cost of production and high analysis 62 k 2 o it contains between 45 and 47 chloride depending on the original rock composition potassium sulfate 52 k 2 o may be used in areas of sulfur deficiency it should not be used in degraded paddy soils such as those in japan in several countries some complete fertilizers such as 141414 151515 21 1010 and 101515 are applied basally in japan nkcompounds such as 160 20 or 17017 are widely used for topdressing rice time of potassium application potassium should be applied during the final land preparation however based on experiments in japan su 1976 summarized the benefits of adequate potassium status at different growth stages potassium absorbed at the maximum tillering stage increases the number of potassium absorbed at the panicle formation stage increases number of potassium absorbed after panicle formation mainly helps increase grain panicles and spikelets panicles and spikelets as well as weight of grains weight a large number of taiwan experiments also summarized by su 1976 showed a positive response of rice to split application of potassium research covering 25 years in japan indicates that the grain yield response to potassium topdressing on degraded and poorly drained rice fields is remarkable noguchi and sugawara 1966 sometimes response to split application of potassium is related to an optimum nitrogenpotassium ratio a basal application of potassium should not be applied when nitrogen supply from the soil and from the basal application is low 404 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice cec of soil is low and drainage in soil is excessive plant spacing is wide low tillering type varieties are used conditions are not favorable for tillering when a low rate of potassium 30 kg k 2 oha is applied it is better to topdress once at the rapid tillering stage in southern japan it is customary to apply one half to twothirds of the total potassium before transplanting and the remainder as one or several topdressings field trials in orissa india showed a modest about 8 but significant benefit of split application compared to basal application of potassium five years of data on clayey soils with high cec in the philippines did not show any beneficial effects of split application of potassium over single basal application de datta and gomez 1975 zinc as long as 50 years ago zinc was recognized as an essential micronutrient sommer and lipman 1926 since then numerous studies have indicated that zinc deficiency is a serious nutritional problem for upland crops nene 1966 in india first reported zinc deficiency in lowland rice since then it has become recognized as a widespread and important nutritional problem throughout the ricegrowing world next to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency zinc deficiency now ranks first among the nutritional disorders that limit grain yield of rice it occurs on histosols sodic calcareous and sandy soils and on soils wet for prolonged periods ponnamperuma 1977 research on nutrition of zinc in rice was stimulated by early work of yoshida 1968 who reported that a disorder of rice plant locally known as hadda in pakistan was caused by zinc deficiency since then zinc deficiency has been reported in many areas in india japan united states brazil and the philippines in the philippines zinc deficiency is the second most serious nutritional disorder limiting the yield of lowland rice at least 13 provinces in the philippines have large areas of zinc deficient soils ponnamperuma 1977 the incidence of zinc deficiency has increased recently because of replacement of traditional varieties by modern varieties which have less tolerance for zinc deficiency or greater need for zinc because of higher production of rice the replacement of ammonium sulfate by urea thereby temporarily in creasing soil ph increased use of phosphorus fertilizer resulting in phosphorus induced zinc deficiency increased use of concentrated fertilizers that contain no zinc or less zinc zinc 405 a number of physiological diseases in rice such as khaira hadda akagare type ii mentek taya taya and alkali diseases have been identified as the result of a zinc deficiency table 106 management of zincdeficient soils it is apparent that zinc deficiency is likely to occur on high ph or calcareous soils and must be corrected if high yields are to be realized a possible solution to zinc deficiency is to drain the field and thereby increase zinc solubility but that is often not possible or desirable because of other benefits that are expected from continuous flooding in zinc deficient soils complete npk fertilizers alone will provide limited yield advantage unless zinc deficiency is corrected first experiments in pakistan showed that without zinc the grain yield was 43 tha but by dipping seedlings in

however for rice the earliest report on sulfur deficiency was reported in 1938 by sen in burma subsequently aiyar 1945 reported sulfur deficiency in rice from india recently chlorosis of rice seedlings in india was corrected by sulfur application in indonesia mentek disease which is associated with sulfur deficiency is common in many parts of the country such as in ngale on grumusols or vertisols east java and south sulawesi ismunadji and zulkarnaini 1977 in brazil sulfur deficiency is serious on soils high in organic matter 58 in newly reclaimed amazon swamps wang et al 1976a b recently sulfur deficiency has been observed in many ricegrowing areas in bangladesh and thailand from nigeria sulfur deficiency in rice was reported by osiname and kang 1975 several reasons have been cited for the recent recording of sulfur deficiency in rice wang 1976 they are replacement of single superphosphate 139 s with concentrated super reduction in atmospheric pollution thereby minimizing sulfur enrichment of less use of farmyard manure increased use of modern varieties which need higher rates of nitrogen phosphate and of ammonium sulfate 242 s with urea soil through rain phosphorus potassium and sulfur blair 1977 suggested that low initial sulfur status may be a primary cause of deficiency particularly in the tropics where some soils have low sulfur content because of low sulfur content in the parent material or extreme weathering and leaching losses or both organic matter losses leaching and erosion losses and fertilizer use and management also often cause sulfur deficiency in the tropics management of sulfurcontaining fertilizers to produce between 4 and 9 t of grains ha a rice crop must remove between 8 and 17 kg s ha wang 1976 410 mineral nutrition and fertilizer management of rice sources of sulfur sulfur additions are generally made as a component of ammonium sulfate 242 s single superphosphate 139 s potassium sulfate 16 18 s and agricultural gypsum 1518 s compound npk fertilizers containing sulfur are also an excellent source of sulfur sulfur coated urea scu developed by tva has also been suggested as an excellent sulfur containing fertilizer for rice single superphosphate is more difficult to store and use than ammonium sulfate the former tends to be more hygroscopic and cakes badly which makes ammonium sulfate a more convenient source of sulfur for rice production in humid tropical areas in sulfur deficient lowland soils in sulawesi indonesia elemental sulfur was as effective as ammonium sulfate and gypsum blair et al 1978 however because urea is the principal source of nitrogen in the asian tropics gypsum should be considered as an excellent source of sulfur for rice in that area time of sulfur application sulfur like nitrogen is required for protein synthesis and should be applied early it is important to apply sulfur before severe deficiency symptoms are observed otherwise yields will be reduced reports from brazil wang et al 1976a indicate that application of sulfur from 2 to 3 weeks before panicle emergence corrected sulfur deficiency on severely sulfur deficient soils silicon for reasons that are still obscure silicon is beneficial for normal rice growth the first evidence that silicon was beneficial for rice was given by sommer 1926 management of silicon fertilizers nearly one third of the area in japan 27 million hectares that grows rice is deficient in silicon the average dosage of silicate material calcium silicate a by product of iron works for these rice fields is 15 20 tha takahashi and miyake 1977 it is now generally believed that rice requires large amounts of silicon in a rice crop producing 10 tha of grains si may be taken up to as much as 1 tha from japan imaizumi and yoshida 1958 reported that the average uptake of si by one crop of rice is 443 kgha source of silicon the most common source of silicon fertilizer is slag containing calcium silicate such as that used in japan in korea the most common slags are derived from the references 411 figure 1018 average results of lime and wollastonite application in the republic of korea 8 provinces 21 soil series 4 replications 1968 office of rural development adapted from park 1979 refuse of iron ferro nickel and manganese ore smelters however part of the silicon source used in korea is from wollastonite calcium metasilicate figure 1018 shows response of rice to added silicon as wollastonite in korean trials the response recorded to silicon was in addition to the yield obtained with npk fertilizers in taiwan silicate slag is effective in a wide range of soils in general slags of basic constituents all have higher silicon solubility hence of higher nutritional value rate of application in most instances 1520 t ha of silicate slag is adequate for rice method of application results from taiwan indicate that a surface basal application of silicate slag is better than basal incorporation although topdressing during early stages of crop growth is as good as basal application results from japan show that both basal dressing and topdressing of silicon give high yield response references abilay w p jr and s k de

a warm humid environment in that environment insects are more prolific than in a cooler dryer environment in addition where year round continuous cropping is practiced there are overlapping insect generations throughout the year insect pests of rice and their control insects substantially reduce rice yields in the tropics for example in 24 separate experiments with lowland rice during six cropping seasons at irri plots protected from insects yielded an average of 53 tha whereas unprotected plots averaged 29 tha seventy insects are considered rice pests but only 20 species are of major importance those species infest all parts of the rice plant at all growth stages and some are vectors of virus diseases pathak 1968a 1970 the major insect pests of rice the major rice insect pests of the tropics are discussed briefly here other publications with details on major rice insect pests are hatai 1975 for south and southeast asia soto and siddiqi 1978 for africa gifford 1973 for the united states and bowling 1979 for various rice growing countries stem borers among the insect pests of rice the stem borers are considered serious pests in tropical rice production they occur at all growth stages and are found in all 420 insect pests of rice and their control 421 table 111 important species of rice stem borers by region adapted from pathak 1969a soto and siddiqi 1978 species

cause extensive damage and exhibit two kinds of symptoms dead heart during the vegetative growth stages the stem borer larvae bore into and feed in the leaf sheath causing broad longitudinal whitish discolored areas at feeding sites the central leaf whorl does not unfold turns brownish and dries the affected tillers dry without bearing panicles this condition is called dead heart white head during the reproductive growth stage particularly after panicle initiation the growing plant parts are severed resulting in drying of panicles empty whitish heads panicles become conspicuous in the field and are called white heads at this stage the grain yield reduction by stem borer is severe leafhoppers and planthoppers many species of leafhoppers and planthoppers cause severe damage to the rice crop when they occur in large numbers they cause a complete drying of the crop called hopper burn even a few hoppers per plant can cause reduction of grain yield leafhoppers and planthoppers are also vectors of virus diseases the brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens stl has become a serious threat to rice production throughout asia although an important rice crop pest in japan for many years the brown planthopper only recently became a major pest in tropical asian countries in the past 6 years the brown planthopper population has greatly increased and caused severe yield losses in several countries figure 111 422 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control figure 111 distribution of the brown planthopper in asia and the gene center for brown planthopper resistance from khush 1979 shows distribution of brown planthopper in asia and the pacific regions table 112 includes the common leafhopper and planthopper pests of rice in addition the leafhoppers and planthoppers recorded in africa include nephotettix modulatus malichar and nilaparvata maender fennah soto and siddiqi 1978 generally the leafhoppers feed on the leaves and upper parts whereas the planthoppers are found at the basal region of the rice plant both damage the plants by sucking the sap and by plugging xylem and phloem tissues infestation by small populations during the early stages of plant growth can reduce the number of tillers plant height and general vigor after panicle initiation a similar small population can cause a high percentage of unfilled spikelets irrigated areas buildup of certain pests such as the brown planthopper causes heavy damage to the rice crop the increase in severity of the insect appears to be associated with the technology used in modern rice culture figure 112 shows a farmers rice crop completely damaged hopper burn by brown planthopper the recent discovery of several biotypes of the brown planthopper underscores the seriousness of this pest the biotypes are not the basic cause of outbreaks but this development has caused the control of this pest to be more difficult heinrichs 1977 the biotypes vary not only in their ability to attack different varieties table 113 but in their susceptibility to control by pesticides if a few brown planthopperresistant rice varieties are planted intensively over wide biotypes of brown planthoppers with

pakistan bangladesh burma nepal sri lanka indonesia thailand laos kampuchea vietnam southern china and africa it is however not recorded in the philippines heinrichs and pathak 1980 the adult gall midge is about the size of a mosquito gall midge attack starts in the seedbed and continues until the booting stage but most damage is limited to the vegetative growth stages the gall midge damage changes rice tillers into tubular galls which dry without bearing panicles new tillers are initiated as the older ones are infested as a result early gall midge infestation causes profuse tillering however the new tillers are eventually attacked by the gall midge thereby reducing vigor and stunting the rice plants rice whorl maggot a dull grey fly called the whorl maggot hydrellia sp is widespread in the philippines the maggots feed on the unopened whorl of the leaf by remaining in the center of the whorl and nibbling the innermost margin of the leaf pathak 1969a the symptoms are manifested as small chewed discolored areas on the innermost margin of the central whorl severe whorl maggot infestation stunts the plant and reduces tillers in a given hill the infestation and damage is limited to vegetative stages of the crop rice leaf folder the rice leaf folder cnaphalocrocis medinalis guen occurs most commonly in the asian tropics although it is known to occur in all rice growing countries of asia the full grown larva is yellowish green with a dark brown head the damage is caused by the larvae which fold the leaf blades into a tubular shape and feed on green leaf tissue within the tubular structures rice bug several insects that suck the sap of the developing rice grains cause serious losses to the rice crop the rice bug is an important example of the grain sucking group the species of rice bugs of major economic significance are 426 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control leptocorisa acuta thunb very common in india sarawak malaysia and new guinea indonesia java and australia l oratorius fabricius common in the far east sri lanka china india l chinensis dallas common in asia the nymphs and adults of rice bugs are difficult to recognize in the rice field because of their color the freshly hatched nymphs are tiny and green but become brownish as they grow both nymphs and adults feed on rice plants armyworms and cutworms the armyworm spodoptera frugiperda b and the cutworm spodoptera litura f although occurring sporadically may cause economic loss of rice crops pathak 1969a the armyworm has been recorded in rice fields in the southern united states and in central american countries the adult moths are of ash color with forewings that are mottled with irregular white or light grey spots near the extreme tip adults migrate from the grassy areas or upland crops to rice fields and deposit their eggs the larvae may eat entire rice plants the common cutworm has been recorded on the indian subcontinent in southeast and east asia china australia and in several african countries the cutworm is a problem mostly in upland rice lowland rice suffers only from larvae migrating from adjacent grassy areas seedlings may be cut at ground level the larvae defoliate older plants rice water weevil the rice water weevil lissorhoptrus oryzophilus kuschel is the most destructive rice insect in the united states where it occurs in all rice growing regions gifford 1973 the adult weevil is greyish and semiaquatic it flies but can also swim just beneath the water surface the adults feed on leaves of young rice plants resulting in longitudinal stripes on the leaf surface in some fields of late rice in texas rice water weevils are so numerous and their feeding so heavy that occasionally some plants die as a result of shredding of the leaves bowling 1975 rice stink bug in the united states practically all rice fields in arkansas louisiana and texas are infested with the rice stink bug oebalus pugnax fabricius the adult stink bug is a straw colored shield shaped insect about 125 mm long gifford 1973 the adult and nymphal stages of the stink bug feed on individual grains of rice as the panicle develops when grain feeding is in the early milk stage the result is an empty glume or shriveled grain as a result of stink bug damage fungi may insect pests of rice and their control 427 develop and cause black spots on grains such grains are commonly called pecky rice such damage may cause reduction in head rice yield or quality bowling 1975 other insect pests there are a host of other insect pests that cause different degrees of damage both in the tropics and in the temperate regions some examples are rice leaf miner hydrellia griseola var scapulasis loew in california the planthopper sogatodes orizicola muir in latin america the chinch bug blissus leucopterus say in arkansas louisiana and texas and the green grasshopper conocephalus fasciatus de geer in texas control of insect pests of rice control of insect pests of rice ranges in practice from chemical control through varietal resistance biological control and cultural control emphasis on varietal resistance increased greatly with the development of the modern rice for the tropics a more recent development is attention to integrated pest control chemical control at present the control of rice insects in the tropics is largely dependent on insecticides even though many traditional and modern varieties of rice have some degrees of resistance to one or more insect pests two types of insecticides are used contact insecticides a contact insecticide is applied on foliage and kills only those insects that come in contact with it for the contact insecticide to be effective it must be applied when the insects are at their most vulnerable growth stage systemic insecticides systemic insecticides are chemicals that when mixed in the paddy water or sprayed on the plants are absorbed by the roots and other plant parts and distributed throughout the plant tissues the advantages of systemic insecticides are that they can kill insects feeding inside the plant and because they are not easily washed away by rains they have longer residual effects than contact insecticides in granular form they can be easily applied with a minimum of equipment and experience classification of insecticides insecticides are classified by their chemical structure organochlorines structures called chlorinated hydrocarbons examples ddt perthane 428 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control organophosphates examples malathion methyl parathion diazinon carbamates examples carbofuran mipc carbaryl formamidines synthetic pyrethroids insecticide formulations insecticides available commercially are sold as dust wettable powder emulsifiable concentrate or granules dust dusts which usually contain only 2 10 of the insecticide are used in areas where it is difficult to obtain a large volume of water for spraying chemical dusts are blended with carriers such as talc dusts are applied as premix using hand dusters ground driven dusting machines or aerial equipment the dusts are powderlike formulations which may consist of toxic agents only such as sulfur toxic agents plus an active diluent that serves as a carrier toxic agents plus an inert diluent in the form of talc or clay wettable powder wettable powder has an appearance similar to a dust but contains a wetting agent that disperses and suspends it when mixed with water and applied as a liquid spray spray solutions must be agitated to keep wettable powders in suspension emulsifiable concentrate an emulsifiable concentrate is an oil based liquid compound containing a high concentration of insecticide the compound is a mixture of insecticide solvents and emulsifiers to make it easily mixed in water and wetting and sticking agents to make the material cover and adhere to the plants granules granular formulations consist of free flowing grains of inert materials mixed or impregnated with an insecticide they are the easiest formulation to apply methods of insecticide application use of high yielding modern rice varieties which are resistant to many insects and diseases does not guarantee adequate protection against all insect pests of rice use of insecticides is often the only practical way to effect immediate reduction in insect populations methods of insecticide application include foliar spray application to paddy water the soil surface or incorporation with top soil treatment of seeds and seedlings as seed treatment seedbed treatment or concentrated placement of insecticides in the soil application of dusts directly on the foliage treatment of roots of rice seedlings prior to transplanting insect pests of rice and their control 429 details on various methods of insecticide applications are discussed in a paper by heinrichs 1979b foliar spray foliar spray is the conventional method of rice insect control in tropical asia contact insecticides are generally applied as foliar sprays from backpack type sprayers one obvious advantage of foliar spray is quick kill of insects when they are visibly damaging the crop the cost of an insecticide as one foliar spray is generally less than one application of a systemic granular insecticide however several foliar applications are often necessary to achieve the same degree of control as one application of a granular systemic insecticide foliar spray is often unsatisfactory because the sprays do not adequately penetrate the thick foliage of the crop rains easily wash off the insecticide and spraying cannot be timed to coincide with the insect pests most vulnerable stages especially when generations overlap in addition foliar sprays may not reach such internal feeders as stem borers the rice gall midge and the rice whorl maggot pathak et al 1974 a recent trend in foliar spray application is use of ultralow volume ulv ultralow volume concentrates are usually the insecticide in its original liquid form or its solid form dissolved in a minimum of solvent with ulv high concentrations of the insecticide are applied directly without adding water application to paddy water soil surface or soil incorporation the disadvantages of using foliar sprays can be largely overcome by applying granular insecticides to the paddy water or soil surface or by incorporating them with the top soil koshihara and okamoto 1957 rao and israel 1967 pathak 1968b table 114 shows that weekly foliar sprays with 004 endrin were required to achieve the same degree of stem borer control as two applications of lindane into paddy water by paddy water application the insecticides are usually effective for 20 30 days as compared to 7 10 days for most foliar sprays pathak and dyck 1973 there is evidence that application of an insecticide on the soil surface without any standing water would be similar in effectiveness to application made into standing water varying in depth from 5 to 15 cm table 115 this is explained by the vaporizing effects of insecticides such as lindane which produces a fumigating effect to kill insects experiments at irri demonstrated that lindane has a substantial fumigation effect on adult moths of the rice stem borer irri 1966 similar results were obtained in the united states by bowling 1970 with carbofuran which caused nearly 100 mortality of a leafhopper draecula cephala portola ball caged on rice plants 2 hours after insecticidal application treatment of seeds and seedlings treatment of rice seeds and seedlings with insecticides has been used to reduce the amount of insecticide applied to the main fields treating the seeds is feasible but insecticide treatments in the seedbed or of the seedlings after uprooting them for transplanting are probably more convenient than treating seeds table 114 comparison of two applications of lindane in paddy water with weekly 004 endrin sprays for rice stem

insecticide solution just before transplanting is another method to provide crop protection against common insect pests for as long as a week after transplanting seedbed treatment or dipping seedlings is convenient and economical but insecticides with low mammalian dermal toxicity must be used to avoid health hazards for transplanters the residual period of such treatments can be considerably increased if the insecticide is absorbed by the rice seedlings to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments the roots of rice seedlings were dipped for 24 hours in 6 ppm solution of various insecticides prior to transplanting in a field experiment the treatment was compared with that of applying the same compound at 2 kg ha to the paddy water of plots planted with untreated seedlings the seedling treatments were clearly inferior to application of insecticide in the paddy water as evidenced by a higher percentage of dead heart tillers from stem borer damage at an early stage fig 113 later studies in the laboratory and greenhouse suggested that seedling treatment was effective against green leafhopper and the brown planthopper irri 1971 mitra et al 1970 in field experiments the root soak treatment also provided some control of the rice whorl maggot and stem borers but the results were inconsistent these data demonstrate that seedling treatment may be effective for brief periods but it needs to be supplemented with other treatments in most of asia where the rice crop is subjected to infestation by many insect pest species the insecticide adhering to the roots appeared more important in determining its residual period than the insecticide absorbed by the plants adding a sticker to the insecticide solution improved the initial effect of this treatment and prolonged the residual effect to about 30 40 days which was 10 20 days longer than when no sticker was used irri 1973 root zone placement the success of the rootcoat insecticide solution plus a sticker treatment led to the practice of placing insecticides in the root zone of the 432 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control figure 113 effect on stem borer control of 6 ppm of various

tilizers stable which results in higher nitrogen efficiency in rice see chapter 10 pathak and his associates at irri were the first to demonstrate that rootzone placement of insecticides was highly efficient in providing sustained control of insect pests in rice pathak et al 1974 in one experiment at irri rootzone placement gave significantly higher yield than an untreated control and gave yield comparable to fourtime broadcast application to paddy water irri 1977 heinrichs et al 1978 the rootzone placement also reduced toxicity to fish table 116 when capsules containing insecticides are placed in the reduced soil layer of the root zone insecticides are more readily available to the plants for a systemic effect inserting the insecticide in capsules below the soil surface protects it from heat sunshine volatilization and loss with drainage water figure 114 data clearly demonstrate that rootzone application is more effective and lasts longer than paddy water application the concentration of both chlordimeform and carbofuran insecticides was highest where each rice hill received the rootzone application aquino and pathak 1976 because the roots are in direct contact with

insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control the bottleneck of using the root zone concept is development of a suitable machine to place the insecticides in the root zone resistance to insecticide at irri and in japan some rice insects which were intensively controlled by insecticides have developed insecticide resistance carbofuran after about 7 years of use at irri failed in 1977 to control the brown planthopper which suggested resistance to that insecticide the brown planthopper biotypes varied in their susceptibility to insecticide tests indicated that biotype 1 was least susceptible to carbofuran heinrichs and valencia 1978 in japan the brown planthopper and white backed planthopper were successfully controlled for many years with lindane ddt malathion and so on the first case of resistance to lindane occurred in 1966 when a severe outbreak of the brown planthopper and the white backed planthopper occurred nagata 1979 resurgence of the brown planthopper where certain insecticides are applied is common throughout tropical asia with the increase in number of insecticide applications the resurgence ratio increases field studies to determine the effect of various methods of carbofuran application on resurgence suggested that brown planthopper resurgence was most common following foliar sprays fig 115 figure 115 hopper burn at 92 days after transplanting in plots treated with carbofuran by four application methods foliar spray was applied four times at 05 kg active ingredientha at 20day intervals irri 1977 from aquino et al 1979 unpublished insect pests of rice and their control 435 varietal resistance at the present level of technology the use of insecticides is perhaps the only practical way to control most insect pests of rice insecticides however have limitations they are expensive require repeated applications and sometimes have undesirable side effects studies of the economics of rice production show that rice farmers generally use small amounts of insecticides and then only when insect damage is visible this however does not help if the insect transmits a virus disease to the rice crop and by the time a farmer observes insect damage it is often too late to prevent crop damage and yield loss the use of insectresistant varieties minimizes total farmer dependence on insecticides for controlling insect pests of rice the first systematic study in insect resistance in rice was initiated when 1000 promising varieties were identified by screening 10000 rices from the world germ plasm collection at irri pathak et al 1969 that screening led to the identification of tkm6 a variety from india that was resistant to stem borers and many other rice insects pathak 1969b this led to the development of ir20 the first modern variety resistant to several insects and diseases the success of ir20 showed that farmers would quickly adopt varieties with resistance to insect pests such as green leafhopper and stem borers for leafhopper resistance the traditional variety from bangladesh pankhari 203 and the first modern variety developed by irri ir8 were excellent cheng and pathak 1972 subsequently the variety mudgo from india was identified for resistance to the brown planthopper pathak et al 1969 because biotypes of planthoppers now pose a serious threat to rice production in the asian tropics systematic screening for resistance to existing biotypes has continued irri 1978b a detailed discussion of resistance to insects is presented in chapter 6 biological control biological control of rice insect pests depends on parasites predators and pathogens that kill the pests insect pests of rice have a well developed complex of natural enemies however systematic studies on importation conservation and augmentation of natural enemies for control of rice pests started only recently one reason for this lag was that insecticides provided easy and effective insect pest control in improved rice farming but even at the present level of insecticidal control conservation of existing natural enemies if not their manipulation is called for in rice insect pest management the natural enemies of some major pests of rice have been identified and their beneficial effects have been recorded in some cases heinrichs et al 1979 parasitic insects there are many records of parasitism of rice stem borers and other insect pests in south and southeast asia table 117 mass rearing and release of trichogramma species have been tested for control of rice stem table 117 examples of high

in japan were not encouraging enough to consider the practice as economical yasumatsu 1975 recently natural enemies of planthoppers and leafhoppers have been identified egg parasitism averaged about 30 parasites also attacked nymphs and adult hoppers but average parasitism was lower irri 1978b predators predators in this context are insects that attack a number of prey other insects devouring them or sucking their body fluids irri research has shown that spiders microvelia sp and cyrtorhinus lividipennis reuter are important natural predators of the green leafhopper and possibly the brown planthopper irri 1978b records from sticky traps around several experimental fields indicated that adults of c lividipennis flew primarily during the first half of the crop period peaking about 25 days after rice was transplanted because that is a peak time when brown planthopper adults fly biological control may be appropriate the use of parasites and predators will be effective however only if they are not killed by indiscriminate use of insecticides in addition rice should have resistance to those insect pests not controlled by parasites and predators ducks herded in rice fields will reduce population size of the brown planthoppers pathogens in a few cases bacillus thuringiensis berliner is sprayed on rice to kill leaf feeding larvae of the rice leaf folder cultural control many cultural practices such as management of fertility weeds water and crop residue and plant spacings and cropping pattern greatly affect insect pests in rice one common example is the interaction of fertilizer application and insect control if the variety is susceptible to a particular insect or a group of insects heavy application of nitrogen fertilizer may aggravate the problem without insect control it may be desirable to apply little or no fertilizer figure 116 shows that susceptible varieties ir8 and ir20 with heavy brown planthopper infestation produced hardly any grain without insect control with insect control ir20 fared better than ir8 the brown planthopper resistant ir1561 2283 produced more than 2 tha without fertilizer and insecticides with fertilizer and no insecticide ir1561 2283 produced at least 4tha this indicates the importance of growing varieties resistant to prevalent insects whenever possible cultural practices should be used to minimize insect pests to a manageable level so that varietal resistance and insecticide applications produce effective control of insects integrated insect pest control integrated pest control uses a variety of technologies

insecticides are used when they can be justified based on economics and ecology all precautions are taken to preserve natural enemies of insect pests it is further recognized that the ultimate objective of integrated pest control is to produce optimum crop yield at minimum cost taking into consideration ecological and socioeconomic constraints under a given agro ecosystem the principles of integrated pest control are the same for insects diseases weeds and other crop pests however in a restricted sense it can be applied to a single pest group such as insects smith and apple 1978 described the principles evolved over the years they are identifying pests proper identification of pests is critical to the develop ment of integrated control measures insect pests of rice and their control 439 defining the agroeconomic system knowledge of the interrelationships between pests and crop gives an understanding of the mobility of the key pest in the agro ecosystem developing the pest management strategy this includes coordinated use of multiple tactics in a single integrated system with an objective to hold pest numbers and damages to tolerable levels establishment of economic injury thresholds the important objective is to determine the crop loss from the anticipated level of pest intensity in terms of quantity and quality of the crop and its economic value developing reliable monitoring and predictive techniques monitoring of pest incidence and weather conditions can often reduce the cost of controlling insect pests evolution of a descriptive and predictive model

overcome social economic and political activities interfering with the development and establishment of integrated pest control overcoming the socioeconomic constraints to the establishment of the rice insect pest management programs research on management as a means of controlling rice insects is in early stages in the tropics however component technology is available for use in an integrated rice pest management system fig 117 assuming that sufficient technology now exists to implement rice insect pest management programs heinrichs et al 1979 suggested the following pro cedures in the formulation of pilot projects select a mechanism that assures group planning and action by all farmers implement training and extension programs in pest management at levels establish monitoring systems that provide reliable information on all fields create an input delivery system to provide inputs when needed for the timely set up an evaluation system to determine the degree of success of the pest within the pilot project area from the research scientists to the farmer throughout the project area and allow sound management decisions application of certain pest management practices

groupsfungus bacteria virus and nematodeaccording to their disease causing agents ou 1972 1973 1979 the distribution of rice diseases in the temperate and tropical regions is governed diseases of rice and their control 441 primarily by temperature and other weather factors it is also influenced strongly by host varietal response and cultural practices although many diseases of rice extend through both tropical and temperate regions some are specific to only one environmental regime symptoms of diseases appear on the leaves stems leaf sheaths inflorescence and grainsthe fungal diseases and one bacterial disease are usually exhibited by localized spots on the leaves leaf sheaths and stems a major bacterial disease is systemic causing either wilting of young plants or lesions on the margin of leaves viral diseases being systemic are generally characterized by abnormal growth stunting of plant depressed or excessive tillering swollen veins and so on and change of leaf color to white yellow or orange ling 1972 fungal diseases of rice the important fungal diseases are rice blast sheath blight leaf scald sheath rot bakanae brown leaf spot narrow brown leaf spot and stem rot rice blast rice blast caused by pyricularia oryzae cav occurs in all rice growing countries it occurs more severely in upland rice than in lowland rice its serious nature was recognized in japan italy the united states atkins 1973 and india early in the century parthasarathy and ou 1963 with greater use of fertilizers for modern varieties the threat of blast disease increased under regimes of low night temperatures 20 24 c and high humidity the severity of infection is high on susceptible varieties the fungus that causes blast disease has many pathogenic races which differ in their ability to infect rice varieties blast races may vary both within and among countries blast is particularly serious in latin america and west africa where upland rice is the major type of rice culture symptoms the lesions of blast are found on the leaves leaf sheaths rachis the joint of culms neck just below rice panicle and the glumes figure 118 shows leaf symptoms of blast and other common diseases of rice the most conspicuous symptoms of blast are on the leaves and neck the center of the lesion has a pale green or dull greyish green water soaked appearance with a dark brown outer rim the center gradually becomes grey or almost straw colored lesions on susceptible varieties tend to coalesce causing complete drying of infected leaves near the joints of the rachillae or rachis of maturing panicles brown to black spots or rings may be present on the glumes small brown to black spots are found on heavily infected panicles the most striking symptoms are the lesions on the neck or on the nodes of the panicles near the base of the panicle producing what is known as neck rot this is the most destructive form of the disease and complete crop failure can result 442 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control figure 118 sketches showing typical lesions of some of the common leaf spot diseases of rice from ou 1973 brown spot brown spot caused by helminthosporium oryzae breda de haan attacks rice plants at all growth stages it occurs primarily in rice suffering from potassium imbalance or grown on soils low in fertility particularly those deficient in nitrogen or on saline soils excessive shading of the rice plants also aggravates this disease although the leaf spotting phase reportedly can cause heavy losses it seldom occurs in fields that are adequately fertilized symptoms the disease appears as small circular oval or elongated brown spots on the coleoptile epicotyl and seedling roots of germinating rice grains it causes seedling and leaf blight and leaf spot of seedlings and mature plants it diseases of rice and their control 443 also causes culm sheath and glume infection at first the lesions are dark reddish brown often with a yellow or gold halo as the circular spots grow older the center becomes greyish with distinct brown borders sheath blight sheath blight is caused by the fungus rhizoctonia solani khn which has the perfect stage thanatephorus cucumeris frank donk it is an important disease in rice in all regionsthe fungus has many strains which differ in morphological characters rate of growth and pathogenicity the high temperature and humidity that prevail in the tropics favor the development of the disease modern rice varieties which use higher rates of fertilizer appear more susceptible to sheath blight than traditional varieties which are often grown without fertilizer the difference in susceptibility however is primarily due to intensive cultural practices followed with modern varieties symptoms plants are usually attacked at about the tillering stage leaf sheaths become discolored at or above water level the lesions are large oblong or irregularly elongated and appear on any part of the leaf sheath some extending on the leaf blades eventually the whole sheath parts and the leaf can easily be pulled off outer leaf sheaths are first affected and the fungus later extends to the inner sheaths in the tropics when sheath blight infection occurs it is not uncommon to find most leaves killed by the time the rice crop is mature in general the disease is more severe in a temperate climate where there are heavy and long dew periods due to the day night temperature differential leaf scald leaf scald caused by rhynchosporium oryzae hashioka yokogi was first described in japan it has recently been reported in most tropical asian countries in the united states and in many african and latin american countries the disease is becoming more serious as crop intensity increases or with increased rate of nitrogen application symptoms leaf scald usually occurs near the tips of leaves but sometimes starts at the leaf margin the lesions are oblong or diamond shaped water soaked blotches which develop into large ellipsoid or oblong olive areas encircled by characteristic zonations ou 1972 stem rot the stem rot fungus magnaporthe salvinii krause webster 1972 sclerotium oryzae catt occurs in almost all rice growing areas in the world it lives in the soil as sclerotium for as long as 6 years atkins 1973 in the united states it is 444 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control less important in texas than in arkansas and louisiana it is most serious in california symptoms the first symptom of stem rot is the appearance of black angular water soaked areas on the sheaths near the water line usually at the maximum tillering or jointing stage generally the lesions on outer sheaths become faded at maturity and are difficult to see in time the fungus infests the culms when the culms are split a cottony greyish mycelial growth is revealed inside the internodes later when the rice approaches maturity many black sclerotia can be found within the culms affected plants are damaged or killed stem rot makes plants susceptible to lodging atkins 1975 bakanae disease bakanae disease is caused by gibberella fujikuroi sawada ito fusarium moniliforme sheld it has been known in japan since 1928 the disease is widely distributed in all rice growing areas of asia symptoms the most conspicuous and common symptom is the bakanae symptom an abnormal elongation of infected plants in the seedbed or the field infected seedlings are several centimeters taller than normal plants and are thin and yellowish green the disease is seed borne and infected plants are seen randomly scattered throughout the seedbed in the field bakanae infected plants are tall with lanky tillers bearing pale green flag leaves above the general level of the crop ou 1973 most of the infected plants will die before producing a panicle or before maturity conidia formed on the lower portion of infected plants are blown to panicles of healthy plants infecting the flowers and causing further crop loss m c rush irri personal communication sheath rot the causal organism of sheath rot is acrocylindrium oryzae sawada it was first described in taiwan in 1922 and is found in japan the united states and all countries of tropical asia symptoms the rot occurs on the uppermost leaf sheaths enclosing young panicles the lesions start as oblong or somewhat irregular spots with brown margins and grey centers or they may be greyish brown throughout they enlarge often coalesce and may cover most of the leaf sheath ou 1972 severe sheath rot infection may prevent proper emergence of the panicles rice seedling diseases in water sown rice in california rice seedling diseases caused by achlya klebsiana pieters and pythium species cause some problems of uniform stand diseases of rice and their control 445 establishment the seedrot and seedling disease of waterseeded rice commonly called watermold disease was epidemic throughout the southern louisiana rice area in 1971 losses of 299 of waterseeded rice were observed in louisiana fields during that year rush et al 1972 these seedrot and seedling diseases are generally more severe when temperatures during the planting season are cool and unfavorable for the growth and establishment of rice seedlings webster et al 1973 symptoms seedrot and seedling disease of rice become evident within few days of seeding into water the most common symptoms are outgrowth of whitish hyphae from the surface of the seed or collar of the plumule the hyphae grow from cracks in the glumes and within a few days a radiating halo of mycelium from the infection point is visible on the seeds if the seedlings produce primary leaves and roots before infection by the fungi they are usually stunted the leaves and leaf sheaths become discolored and further development is retarded webster et al 1970 control of fungal diseases a successful disease control program for rice must be reflected in economic benefits through increased yield increased quality or both optimum manage ment of rice diseases requires knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease rice diseases irrespective of cause are usually controlled by appropriate measures taken before the disease develops not after an outbreak chemical control the use of chemicals to control fungal or any rice disease must be economical for blast chemical control is possible but for some areas it is not economical under severe blast conditions chemical control is highly profitable recently antibiotic preparations often used in combination with organomercuric corn pounds were found effective organomercuric compounds may cause phyto toxicity to some rices spraying with systemic fungicides such as benomyl can control blast but it is expensive for sheath blight control chemicals such as benomyl validamycin a neoasozin thiophanatemethyl and several coded compounds were found effective in reducing infection and increased grain yield over untreated control varietal resistance in the tropics breeding for resistant rice varieties is perhaps the only realistic solution to the fungus disease problem however a breeding program must take into consideration the variability of the causal organisms for example breeding rice varieties resistant to all known blast races would be extremely difficult however by accumulating genes with a broad spectrum of resistance into a variety more stable resistant varieties may be developed 446 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control figure 119 percentage of varieties susceptible to each isolate names of japanese and

been identified but several varieties have moderate resistance diseases of rice and their control 447 bacterial diseases of rice two bacterial diseases are of importance in rice bacterial leaf blight a systemic disease is widespread throughout asia and has recently been identified in africa and latin america ou 1979 it has been recognized as one of the most damaging diseases of rice in southern japan for the past 60 years ishiyama 1922 first reported the cultural and physiological characteristics of the bacterial leaf blight bacteria considerable progress has been made on understanding the disease organisms and developing resistant varieties bacterial leaf streak which causes localized lesions is also distributed widely in asia bacterial leaf blight bacterial leaf blight is caused by xanthomonas oryzae uyeda and ishiyama dowson the bacterial isolates differ considerably in virulence studies in japan show that many isolates collected from various countries of south and southeast asia showed high virulence as compared with those from japan wakimoto 1975 isolates from south asia are more virulent than those from southeast asia buddenhagen and reddy 1972 even within some countries such as india and the philippines the isolates of the bacterium vary in virulence symptoms in the tropics the bacterial leaf blight has three types of symptomsthe leaf blight the kresek and the pale yellow plant the relation ship among them based on inoculation test and observation is seen in fig 1110 although x oryzae is involved in all symptoms kresek and leaf blight seem distinct and independent of each other which means an individual rice plant may suffer from either bacterial leaf blight at the seedling stage is important in the tropics ou 1973 most strains are capable of causing kresek symptoms during seedling and early tillering stages of rice apparently the bacterium enters the leaf through the cut surface of leaves or through the roots during transplanting and systematically figure 1110 the relationship of the bacterial blight syndrome from irri 1978b 448 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control reaches the crown or growing point leaves of the infected plants become water soaked and begin to fold up and roll along the midrib finally wilting of the whole leaves or plant occurs the entire seedling ultimately dies bacterial leaf blight damage is often attributed to the stem borer the leaf stage of bacterial leaf blight is the most widespread and therefore causes the most damage early symptoms include yellow undulate lesions along the margins of the upper portion of the leaf blades the lesions develop rapidly parallel to the veins and extend laterally to the healthy regions in extreme cases a large portion of the entire leaf blade becomes infected turns yellow or dirty white and finally dies bacterial leaf streak bacterial leaf streak a disease limited to the tropics is caused by xanthomonas translucens jones johnson and reddy dowson f sp oryzicola fang et al bradbury the organism attacks chiefly the parenchymatous tissue between veins of the leaves and in the early stages remains confined to the interveinal spaces it may enter the leaf through the stomata or through wounds which are mainly caused during storms symptoms symptoms manifested are the appearance of fine interveinal long or short lines which are water soaked and greyish the lesions extend and coalesce to form larger patches and become yellow from the death of cells eventually a large portion of the entire leaf blade becomes yellow to dirty white at this stage the symptoms are difficult to distinguish from the bacterial leaf blight control of bacterial diseases because rainfall has a close causal relationship with bacterial diseases occur rence of these diseases is considered unavoidable in south and southeast asia where there is a heavy monsoonal season this limits any successful chemical control of bacterial diseases varietal resistance is the most important single method for avoiding occurrence of bacterial diseases in the tropics chemical control chemicals such as copper or mercury compounds and antibiotics have been used to control bacterial diseases acetylene dicarboxamide has been used as have sprays with streptomycin 3000 ppm and cupric hydroxide varietal resistance sources of genetic resistance to bacterial diseases are available and have been used in developing modern rice varieties these varieties are now grown in most ricegrowing countries diseases of rice and their control 449 a simple inoculation method allows

nigropictus stl n parvus n virescens distant and recilia dorsalis motschulsky ling 1976 symptoms stunting yellowing of leaves and slight reduction in tiller numbers are observed in tungro susceptible varieties stunting is caused by shortening of the leaf sheath leaf blade and internode yellowing usually starts from the tips of the leaves the color may vary from light yellow to orange yellow or brownish yellow on the yellow leaf and occasionally on the green leaf irregularly spaced dark brown blotches frequently develop young leaves of infected plants are usually mottled with pale green to whitish spots the pattern varying from mosaic to stripes of various lengths parallel to the veins the grains are usually covered with dark brown blotches grassy stunt grassy stunt virus is transmitted

the disease was later reported in most tropical asian countries recently grassy stunt became severe in indonesia but has caused little damage in other countries symptoms grassy stunt symptoms on diseased plants are severe stunting excessive tillering and an erect growth habit the leaves are short narrow pale green or pale yellow and often have numerous small dark brown dots or spots of various shapes which may form blotches young leaves of some varieties may be mottled or striped the leaves may remain green when supplied with adequate fertilizer ragged stunt ragged stunt was first reported in north cotabato in the philippines in 1977 bergonia 1977 because of the ragged leaf symptoms and stunting exhibited by infected plants the name ragged stunt was adopted the disease was character ized and identified as caused by a virus transmitted by a brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens stl ling et al 1978a b after 1977 disease symptoms were observed in rice plants in india sri lanka heinrichs and khush 1978 in indonesia hibino et al 1977 in thailand weerapat and pongprasert 1978 and more recently in china symptoms the symptoms of rice ragged stunt vary at different growth stages they include stunting of plants appearance of ragged leaves twisted leaves vein swelling delay in flowering production of nodal branches incomplete emer gence of panicles and panicles bearing mostly unfilled spikelets other symptoms are not easily seen for example the color of the diseased plants and number of tillers often do not vary a great deal from those of healthy plants however stunting of plants often causes marked reduction in crop height yellow dwarf yellow dwarf virus is widespread in japan and tropical asian countries ou 1972 ling 1972 but in tropical asia the virus does not cause economic yield losses because of the long incubation period in the insect and the host plant nephotettix cincticeps uhler is the vector that transmits yellow dwarf virus in japan nephotettix virescens distant and n nigropictus stl are vectors in other countries symptoms general chlorosis especially on the newly emerged and young leaves is the first symptom of yellow dwarf the color varies from yellowish to green as the disease progresses the infected plants become severely stunted tillering increases markedly and leaves become soft and droopy the infected plants produce either no panicles or a few small panicles which bear mostly unfilled spikelets 452 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control orange leaf orange leaf disease was first found in thailand in 1960 then in the philippines in 1962 ou 1972 ling 1972 the virus is transmitted by recilia dorsalis the disease does not cause serious reductions of rice yield symptoms in the field orange leafinfected plants have golden yellow to deep bright orange leaves when the plants are about one month old or older the infected plants die before flowering hoja blanca hoja blanca white leaf was recognized as a new viral disease of rice in latin america in 1957 adair and ingram 1957 hoja blanca is limited to the western hemisphere it is transmitted by sogatodes cubanus crawford and s orizicola muir symptoms plants with hoja blanca show stunting and reduced tillering with new leaves unfolding normally ling 1972 the major field symptoms are the appearance of white or chlorotic stripes on the leaves or the occurrence of completely white leaves stunting of the white plant and poor or partial filling of spikelets at maturity ou 1973 control of virus diseases control measures for viral diseases include practice of clean crop culture such as removal of weeds and volunteer rice rouging of diseased plants use of insecticides to control the insect vectors and planting resistant rice varieties chemical control of vectors although there is no meaningful chemical control of viral diseases controlling vectors with pesticides can be effective for some viruses pathak et al 1967 however once disease symptoms appear chemical control of vectors does not effectively reduce incidence of viral diseases varietal resistance excellent sources of resistance are available for all tropical viral diseases of rice except the ragged stunt virus resistant genes for tungro grassy stunt yellow dwarf and hoja blanca have been incorporated in many modern rice varieties there are three major steps in producing the resistant varieties ling 1972 develop a method of testing and screening and of standardizing scales for identify a source of genes conferring resistance measuring resistance diseases of rice and their control 453 incorporate those genes with other desirable qualities of the crop the resistance of a rice plant to a viral disease can only be determined after the plant is exposed to the virus the varietal reaction to a viral disease by a natural infection can be tested in the field but because disease pressure in the field is not constant the field reaction of a rice to viral diseases fluctuates from time to time and from place to place regardless of variety however a rice that has a consistently low field reaction should be more resistant than a rice that does not show such a reaction nematodes of rice several rice diseases are caused by nematodes also known as eelworms or roundworms nematodecaused diseases have been reported to occur in rice fields in the indian subcontinent the two major nematode caused diseases are white tip disease and ufra white tip disease white tip disease is caused by the nematode aphelenchoides besseyi christie it is present in many tropical countries particularly in india and bangladesh in 19351945 the disease caused severe losses of rice in the united states in arkansas louisiana and texas symptoms the most distinguishing symptom of white tip is the presence of leaves with white tips of 255 cm long the tips of the developing leaves may be twisted and wrinkled and the flag leaf may be twisted near the panicle the infected plants are generally stunted davide 1970 ufra disease ufra disease is caused by the nematode ditylenchus angustus butler filipjev and has been reported from india bangladesh burma thailand malaysia and egypt the disease is also known as dak pora in bangladesh akhet pet in burma and yadngo twisted pathogen in thailand in india it is considered one of the important diseases of rice symptoms infected plants are severely stunted often with withered leaves which sometimes show brown areas near the node at times the heads develop partially but are twisted and deformed developing heads may contain many nematodes in all stages from eggs to adults davide 1970 control of nematodes white tip disease is controlled by dipping seeds in hot water 55 61c for 15 minutes chemicals such as parathion can also be used to treat the seeds 454 insects diseases and other pests of rice and their control ufra disease can be controlled by field sanitation practices such as use of clean seeds avoiding use of irrigation water from an infected field and burning of stubble multiple resistance to various insects and diseases building resistance to disease and insect attacks into the modern rice varieties remains a key element in rice breeding such resistant varieties mean higher rice yields and lower production costsfactors important to the rice farmer and in the long run to the rice consumer details on multiple resistance to insects and diseases are given in chapter 6 other pests of rice and their control besides insects and diseases a variety of other pests affect tropical rice production they are rodents birds snails crabs and some large animals however rodents and birds are the most serious pests among those mentioned rodents in rice fields rodents particularly rats cause serious damage to the rice crop at all growth stages they eat seeds in direct seeded rice and seedlings they gnaw off tillers damage plants and feed on rice grains at various stages they also destroy stacked rice stored threshed rice and hulled rice in retailers bins there are many species of rats that destroy rice but rattus rattus l as a group is most prevalent in rice fields alfonso and sumangil 1970 rats move and feed at night they burrow holes in levees thereby causing water leakage and decreasing water use efficiency in rice control of field rats among rat control practices keeping the levees bunds free from weeds making fields farm house and storage areas ratproof and baiting with poisons are common however none of these practices is foolproof to protect experi mental fields electric rat fences are sometimes used at irri and at other experiment stations in southeast asia there are two kinds of poisons to kill rats acute poisons cause death shortly after ingestion sodium fluoroacetate slow acting poisons are anticoagulants that induce death after a rat ingests compound 1080 and zinc phosphide are most common poisons for several days examples are warfarin and coumarin references 455 baiting results from taiwan suggest that the levels of bait acceptability for field rodents are variable and are influenced by the surrounding environment such as the type and growth stages of the crops for example when bait is offered at the ripening stage of rice acceptability by rodents is relatively low after harvest however acceptability increases steeply as good food sources for the rodents are reduced to low levels therefore a rodent control program should begin before crops are abundant and close to harvest and provide a regular food source the optimum control of rodents in rice paddies will occur when poison baits are offered before the rice flowering stage and then continued after harvest ku 1979 birds in rice fields birds cause considerable damage shortly after seeding directseeded rice and from flowering time onward in any rice culture birds cause more damage to a shattering rice variety than to a nonshattering type in tropical asia the weaver birds of the genus ploeus parakeets munia and sparrows are most serious birds such as the migratory african species quelea quelea linn cause serious damage to the rice crop in africa wild ducks and geese damage the rice crop in many countries including australia united states and in some countries of latin america for control of birds various soundmaking devices are often used in some areas various improved devicesgas operated cannonsare used snails in rice fields snails such as lanistes ovum trosch ampullaria lineata and a glauca destroy

weeds are often called plants out of place they are unwanted useless prolific competitive often harmful to the total environment even poisonous and they occur in every rice field in the world as they interfere with agricultural operations they reduce the potential production of rice weeds cause many direct damages to a crop weeds in cultivated fields reduce rice yield and quality by competing for weeds intensify the problem of diseases insects and other pests by serving as weeds reduce the efficiency of harvesting aquatic weeds reduce the efficiency in irrigation systems it is estimated that annual crop losses due to weeds in asia are 118 of potential production value the corresponding figure for the world is 95 one estimate at irri suggests weed growth in unweeded plots reduces yield by as much as 34 in transplanted rice 45 in direct seeded rainfed lowland rice and 67 in upland rice effective weed control requires knowledge of the names distribution ecology and biology of weeds in the rice growing regions weeds are classified as grasses broadleaf weeds or sedges table 121 gives some examples of the common weeds in tropical rice fields in most tropical asian countries moderate year round warm temperature and high humidity encourage year round growth of weeds the number and diversity of weed species in the rice fields in subtropical and temperate areas are shown in table 122

competition 467 cropweed competition crops and weeds compete for the same resourcesnutrients water space light competition begins when crops and weeds grow in close proximity and the supply of any necessary growth factor falls below the demands of both the overall effect of cropweed competition is a reduction in the biomass of rice and a reduction in grain yield crop competition from weeds is dependent on such factors as the environ ment the crop grown and its density the stage of the crop the weeds and their density the stage of the growth of weeds and measures taken by the farmer to control weeds likewise the environment associated with the crop determines the weed community growing in association with the crop competition is greatest between plants that are similar in growth habits such as root growth and foliage characteristics because they make nearly the same demands upon the environment those species that best utilize environmental growth factors will dominate when population levels are similar crops and weeds may also influence each other by metabolic products which are secreted or remain in the soil as residues of decaying plant material components of competition competition for light occurs whenever plants are grown close together and one plant shades another to the point that the intensity and quality of the light received by the shaded plant are less than necessary for optimum growth for example a rice crop suffers little competition for light from monochoria vaginalis burm f presl because of the latters short stature plants vary greatly in their requirement for water competition for water and nutrients is usually more important because it begins before competition for light competition for water is greater when roots of crop and weeds are closely intermingled and obtaining their water from the same volume of soil this means weed competition for water is more serious for upland and rainfed rice than for irrigated rice because moisture is often limiting in competing for nutrients weeds will absorb as much or more than the crop plant generally the factors that give a plant a competitive advantage in water uptake also give it a competitive advantage in nutrient uptake competition between weeds and crop for space and carbon dioxide is generally not critical allelopathy reduction in growth and yield of crops caused by weeds may be due to a factor other than competition an allelopathic effect may also occur allelopathy is the deleterious effect of one plant on another through the production of toxic chemical compounds that enter the environment allelopathic effects of weeds on crop plants and vice versa are known to occur 468 weeds and weed control in rice management practices and weed competition in tropical agriculture weeds grow vigorously and cause major crop production problems in rice the crop weed competition varies with the type of culture upland lowland or deepwater methods of planting transplanting or direct seeding variety tall or semidwarf low or high tillering and cultural practices land preparation spacing fertilization seed purity and so on such variation in competition presents an opportunity to develop combinations of practices to minimize weed problems in rice the widespread replacement of traditional tall tropical varieties with modern varieties may have increased weed problems throughout tropical asia the traditional varieties have droopy leaves the semidwarfs are shorter in stature and have erect leaves therefore more light penetrates the crop canopy and more weeds emerge and survive furthermore the high fertilizer rates used on modern rice varieties aggravate weed problems competition in flooded rice flooded or moist soils favor an abundant supply of viable weed seed in rice fields vega and sierra 1968 reported more than 800 million viable seeds per hectare within a soil depth of about 15 cm such weed seeds germinate and severely compete with the rice crop rice yield losses caused by weeds in flooded rice fields vary with the time of weed infestation soil fertility rice varietal type and planting method de datta et al 1969 the most serious competition is from grass alone or from a mixed weed population grasses broadleaf weeds and sedges table 124 competition from weeds during early growth stages of the rice crop is more serious than no competition during early growth stages followed by competition during later growth stages table 125 therefore early weed control is more important to the achievement of high rice yields de datta et al 1969 the duration of weed control however affects rice varieties in different ways for example 20 days of weed free growth appears best in short statured plant types such as ir8 table 126 for c4 63 an intermediate statured variety the weed free period should be extended to the first 30 days after transplanting vega et al 1967 in a rice crop weeds have a significant effect on

environment can be accomplished physically tillage fire flooding smothering culturally crop rotation biologi cally or chemically an example of the principle involved in physical weed control would be that young weed leaves depend on roots for carbohydrate supply therefore cultivation should be delayed until the carbohydrate flow from the roots ceases and the leaves begin to manufacture enough food to start replenishing the root reserve thus with most perennial weeds tillage 1014 days after emergence is more effective for carbohydrate starvation than tillage immediately after germination appleby 1967 herbicidal manipulation of the weeds environment is the result of a chemical that disrupts a vital function of one plant and not of another such selectivity may depend on many mechanical physical chemical or metabolic aspects for example in directed placement of a spray the weed plants are sprayed contacted but the crop plants are not many weeds are controlled by the herbicide propanil 3 4dichloro propionanilide because the rice detoxifies propanil whereas the weeds have limited capacity to break down propanil selectivity exists between crops and weeds and between various weed species themselves this can cause important ecological shifts of weed species in a mixed population of weeds many important principles involving the use of herbicides are concerned with interaction between the herbicide and soil adsorption of herbicides by soil is a methods of weed control 475 process that needs to be understood for more efficient use of herbicides among the factors that influence soil adsorption of herbicides the amount of organic matter soil texture and type of clay are important other principles involved in successful weed control are primarily agronomic in nature the choice of method will depend on the technology available types of rice culture and farmers resources and preferences the cost of the weedcontrol measures must be compared with the resulting value of the increase in yield but the weed control method that the farmer selects should be one that subjects the weed population to a variety of pressures so that no particular weed or weed community will become established and cause continuous damage moody and de datta 1977 among the weedcontrol practices that are critical for success timeliness of weeding is dominant because weeds provide the greatest competition and cause the most damage at early crop growth early control is important methods of weed control it is entirely possible that weeds were a problem and that some primitive form of weed control was practiced when man first began to cultivate crops about 8000 bc since then man has been engaged in a continuous struggle against weeds several new weed control measures have been developed and adopted and old ones reexamined and modified but none of the original practices has been completely abandoned there are no weed control measures that will give continuous and effective weed control when used in isolation in fact there is no weed control method that is best for use in all situations because weeds vary in their growth habits and life cycles the final choice of any weed control measure by the farmer will depend largely on effectiveness and economics the cost of the weed control must be compared with the resulting increased value of the crop although no single weed control measure will give continuous and effective weed control when used in isolation each control measure is covered separately in this discussion the discussion of individual factors is followed by examples of multiple factors integrated management practices that affect weed control and management for tropical rice factors for control and management of weeds are grouped as substitutive preventive complementary and direct methods accord ing to type of rice culture substitutive and preventive factors in weed control land preparation and water management are field operations that can substitute for another operation for a certain degree of weed control land preparation varies depending on the type of rice culture lowland or upland and the method of planting transplanting or direct seeding 476 weeds and weed control in rice minimized weed growth is an obvious benefit of land preparation particu larly puddling see chapter 8 good water management is an important factor in weed control in rice emergence of weeds and types of weeds are closely related to the moisture content of the soil and the depth of irrigation many weeds will not germinate under flooding but roughly 80 of the rice grown in south and southeast asia is subjected to uncontrolled water supply which exposes the rice crop to various degrees of weed pressure see chapter 9 preventive measures to check the introduction and spread of weed seed are perhaps no less important than any other weed control measure it is probably easiest and most economical to practice preventive measures to substantially minimize weed seed introduction planting weed infested seed is a common way of introducing weeds into a clean field the problem in direct seeded rice is more serious than in transplanted rice because it is difficult to separate rice and weed seeds red rice a serious weed in direct seeded rice fields in the united states is largely introduced through seeding smith et al 1977 other preventive measures to minimize the introduction of weed seed include weed free seedbeds clean levees and irrigation canals clean tools and machinery livestock kept out of fallow fields and prevention of weed seed formation or vegetative propagation of weed tubers complementary practices in weed control perhaps the most useful factors of weed control are those that provide favorable stand establishment and growth for the crop and that are simultaneously unfavorable to the weeds particularly if such practices are economically attractive to farmers manipulation of time and method of planting variety planting density fertilizer management and crop rotation should aim for maximum benefit to the crop and minimum benefit to the weeds planting method a farmer chooses a particular method of planting rice for various reasons but crop competition with weeds and use of weeding methods are important considerations for a specific choice straight row planting either by transplant ing or by direct seeding makes weeding by hand pulling or by mechanical tools easier thorough puddling before transplanting incorporates weeds thus giving the rice seedlings a head start over weeds that germinate later if land preparation and water management are adequate this competitive advantage is retained throughout most of the transplanted crops growth furthermore transplanting methods of weed control 477 encourages effective use of preemergence herbicides and fewer herbicide applications than needed to control weeds in directseeded rice the transplant ing operation as the transplanters move backward during planting helps incorporate weeds and weed seeds into the soil seedling age is easily manipulated in transplanted rice in tropical asia many farmers use tall old seedlings of traditional tall varieties in the wet season because they give better weed competition than young seedlings with the modern semidwarf varieties manipulation of seedling age for weed control is not important if preemergence herbicides are used but if weeds are not controlled young seedlings are less desirable than somewhat older 2130 days seedlings in japan for example the introduction of shorter 14 cm tall seedlings for mechanical transplanting caused as much as 89 yield losses by weeds versus 59 in rice of normal seedlings 234 cm tall matsunaka 1976 these results are no longer relevant in japan because intensive weed control is practiced however the results explain why many farmers in tropical asia where land preparation and water management in lowland rice are generally poor still prefer to use older 3040 days and taller seedlings than the 21dayold seedlings normally recommended by rice researchers more weeds grow in directseeded than in transplanted rice with direct seeding into water or onto mud resulting in less weed competition than direct seeding into dry soil variety because rice farmers in tropical asia had depended on tall vigorously tillering plants to provide weed competition the introduction of modern semidwarf rice varieties increased weed problems and the need for weed control became more obvious the modern rices allow more light to penetrate the crop canopy thus allowing more weed seed to germinate and weeds to grow better furthermore the high fertilizer rates used with modern rice varieties aggravate weed problems nevertheless the ir8 plant type with its high tillering capacity is fairly competitive with weeds despite its short stature lowtillering varieties with the same yield potential as ir8 when grown under ideal conditions have not fared well under farm conditions the advantage of relatively taller plants 120130 cm is less in irrigated rice than in rainfed rice because even though weed control is easier taller plants lodge earlier and yield less than semidwarfs on rainfed rice farms however heavy tillering varieties of medium stature may be better suited than semidwarfs if management practices such as land preparation water and fertilizer applica tions are less than optimal even at experiment stations a recent study indicated that an intermediatestatured rice ir442258 competed better than a semi dwarf variety ir20 with both annual and perennial weeds detailed results on irri studies on varietal difference in weed competition are given elsewhere de datta 1977b bangladeshi farmers generally do more intensive hand weeding with modern than with traditional varieties whether transplanted or directseeded hoque et 478 weeds and weed control in rice al 1976ab this can be interpreted as meaning that weed problems or expectations on returns from weeding are less with traditional than with modern varieties it is also believed that it is critical to weed earlymaturing rices earlier than late maturing rices that is because barnyard grasstype weeds grow fast and damage earlymaturing rice more than latematuring rice if preemergence herbicide is used however the growth duration of rices may not be critical in irrigated rice but may still pose problems in rainfed rice plant spacing and plant density close spacing is essential to minimize weed infestation and to obtain high yields that is because the closer the rice plants are sown the greater the competition against weeds that grow in association with rice in a study by estorninos and moody 1976 more weeds grew at the 25 25 cm than at 15 15 cm spacing table 1211 the grain yield decrease due to weeds averaged 18 at 15 15 cm 30 at 20 20 cm and 52 at 25 25 cm compared with weedfree plots however the increased cost of close spacing should be compared with that of somewhat wider spacing combined with other weedcontrol practices in wetseeded rice moody 1977a reported less weed competition as seeding rates increased in the range of 80200 kg ha however a grain yield advantage was not recorded for different seed rates again the increased cost of increased seeding rates should be compared with that of lower rates combined with other weedcontrol practices particularly if the increased seeding rate does not increase grain yields table 1211 effect of plant spacing on weight of weeds growing in association with transplanted

grass population more than the broadleaf weeds and sedges the application of nitrogen as a basal treatment in dry seeded rice is unwise unless preemergence herbicides are used topdressing the dry seeded crop with nitrogen after weeding is desirable to maximize nitrogen fertilizer efficiency and to minimize weed growth cropping systems the possibility of a buildup of a certain weed species or group of species is greater if the same crop is grown year after year crop rotation therefore minimizes the undisturbed development of weeds de datta and jereza 1976 in many instances crop rotation can eliminate or at least reduce difficult weed problems recent results show that various crop and soil management practices cause the weed community to shift from weed species that are difficult to

of rice is also essential this puts pressure on various weed species so that no single species or group of species develops undisturbed in the future more effective treatments need to be developed for different weed compositions and relevant cropping system with a view to developing several equally effective alternatives that make most efficient use of the farmers available resources the weed control technique finally chosen will then be determined by the individual crop situation and the farmers most limiting resources because it is unlikely that any one technique could be expected to suit the resource base of all farmers direct methods of weed control the substitutive preventive and complementary weed control practices gen erally minimize weed populations to a manageable level but do not eliminate them farmers must still resort to the most direct methods of weed control including hand weeding mechanical weeding and herbicides often the most important factor is when not how weeds are controlled the direct methods of weed control used in asia vary greatly and depend on the type of rice culture farmers resources such as land labor and capital are important considerations in making the final choice of weeding method de datta and barker 1977 hand weeding hand weeding is common in almost all tropical rice growing areas but the degree of hand weeding and the problems associated with it largely depend on the type of rice culture several hand toolsthe hoe narrow spade swiss hoe knife machete and even pointed sticksare used with various degrees of success to control weeds in dryseeded rice in many countries in west malaysia repeated cutting with a tajak a kind of scythe followed by flooding and soil puddling is used to control weeds in transplanted rice in bangladesh weeds in rice fields are controlled by a hand tool locally known as niranee several other tools are also used to control weeds in burma implements called dawset and gwinset are drawn by animals to chop down weeds and incorporate them with the soil transplanted rice hand weeding is the most common weed control method in transplanted rice one hand weeding or two at the most should be sufficient to control weeds adequately in transplanted rice studies in 1967 showed that delay of a single hand weeding beyond 42 days after transplanting significantly reduced the yield of ir8 and increased the labor needed for weeding table 1214 the differences in grain yields between one hand weeding 2142 days after transplanting and two hand weedings were not significant this sugggests that one properly timed hand weeding may be adequate to reduce the weed populations enough to obtain high yields with modern varieties however early 482 weeds and weed control in rice table 1214 effects of

less and weed control can be more timely if rice is drilled rather than broadcast when hand weeding broadcast rice the weeders destroy some rice plants de datta and bernasor 1973 dryseeded rice dry seeding is done in either bunded fields or innonbunded fields upland rice for both rain provides all of the moisture for crop growth weeds grow profusely in dryseeded rice and without weed control there is a total yield loss de datta 1978 in a study with a traditional upland variety palawan the maximum yield for a single hand weeding was when weeding was 25 days after seeding the yield 26 t ha was however more than a ton below that of rice weeded three times 37 t ha a delay in hand weeding beyond 1525 days sharply reduced yields based on the differences between weeding at 25 and 45 days

labor consuming mechanical weeding weeding by machine is feasible only where rice is planted in straight rows rotary weeders are pushed by hand or powered by a small gasoline engine 484 weeds and weed

smother and incorporate weeds in the philippines upland rice farmers use an animal drawn implement called a kalmot it also smothers some rice plants but the local rice varieties recover because of their deep root system the kalmot is not an ideal method of weed control but considering the farmers resources it effectively minimizes weeds chemical weed control attention to study of weeds and their control increased following the discovery of the herbicidal property of 24 d 24 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid in the united states in the early 1940s in some instances herbicides offer the most practical effective and economical means of reducing weed competition crop losses and production losses herbicides are chemicals used for killing or inhibiting the growth of certain plants there are nearly 200 herbicidesoften chemically and functionally diverse and highly selectiveavailable for use on various crops throughout the world for most weed problems there are herbicides available the choice or use of any particular herbicide depends primarily on economics in some situations returns from a herbicide do not justify its use in others socioeconomic conditions do not allow it to be used extensively types of herbicides herbicides differ in how they kill plants in the types of plants that they kill and the amounts needed to kill plants herbicides may be grouped on the basis of one or more common characteristics such as their chemistry molecular composition and configuration biological effect mode of action selectivity fate in plants time of application preplant preemergence postemergence or use control of annuals or perennials grasses broadleaf weeds or sedges herbaceous or woody plants herbicides are applied by hand or sprayed by hand sprayers in the asian tropics

in rice 1 time of application the terms pre and postemergence are used to denote time of application of herbicides to both the crop and the weeds many people prefer to use such terms solely with respect to the crop but to avoid confusion the stage of development of both the crop and the weeds should be stated preplant a preplant treatment is any treatment made before the crop is planted examples of herbicides that can be applied preplant are dalapon 22dichloropropionic acid glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine and paraquat 11dimethy1 44bipyridylium ion a preplant incorporated treatment is one in which the herbicide is incorporated into the soilto prevent volatilization or to place the chemical in the zone in which it is neededprior to the planting of the crop examples of preplant incorpo rated herbicides are dinitramine nn diethyl 2 6 dinitro 4 trifluoromethyl m phenylenediamine eptc s ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate and triflur alin 2 6 dinitro nn dipropyl 4 trifluoromethylaniline preemergence a preemergence treatment is made after the crop has been planted but prior to the emergence of the crop or weeds or both the herbicide is usually applied to the soil surface examples of preemergence herbicides are atrazine 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 26 isopropylamino 135 triazine butachlor n butoxymethyl a chloro 26 diethylacetanilide and propachlor chloro n isopropylacetanilide postemergence a postemergence herbicide is applied after the crop or weeds or both have emerged from the soil examples of postemergence herbicides are 24 d and dinoseb 2 sec butyl 46 dinitrophenol 2 mode of action mode of action includes the entire series of events that occur within the plant from its first contact with the herbicide to its ultimate effect which could be death of the plant contact herbicides the contact herbicides are applied to the foliage and kill plant tissues at or close to the site of application contact herbicides are ineffective against perennial weeds except when they are in the seedling stage young grasses which have their growing points below the soil surface will frequently be more tolerant than broadleaf plants which have their growing points exposed examples of this type of herbicide are paraquat and dinoseb systemic herbicides the systemic or translocated herbicides can be applied to the foliage or to the soil and are capable of movement within the plant to exert effects away from the site of application examples are 24 d and atrazine 3 selectivity a herbicide may be selective to a particular crop at recom mended rates but if higher rates are used the herbicide may damage or even kill the crop selective herbicides a herbicide that kills or stunts some plant species with little or no injury to others is selective examples of selective herbicides are atrazine for maize propazine 2 chloro 4 6 di isopropylamine 1 3 5 a methods of weed control 487 triazine for sorghum alachlor a 26diethyl n methoxymethylacetanilide for peanut and butachlor for rice nonselective herbicides a herbicide that kills all plant species is non selective examples are paraquat and glyphosate herbicide formulations herbicides are frequently insoluble in water and are usually applied at such low rates that they must be combined with a liquid or solid carrier to make their applications easier to increase their effectiveness and to be distributed evenly during application in addition the formulation can have an effect on herbicide solubility volatility biological activity and other characteristics water and oilsoluble herbicides inorganic herbicides and the salts of some organic herbicides are soluble in water the solution thus formed is a stable physically homogeneous mixture these herbicides are sold either as solids or aqueous concentrates depending upon their solubility rate or on the physical properties of the present compound examples are the sodium and amine salts of 24 d and sodium salt of dalapon some herbicides dinoseb and pentachlorophenol for example are soluble in oil they are often dissolved in oil and used to increase the toxicity of oil sprays referred to as fortified oils ester formulations of 24 d and related products are also soluble in oil emulsions an emulsion is formed when one liquid is dispersed in another liquid each maintaining its original identity some herbicides that are insoluble in water may be dissolved in oil or another organic solvent together with a suitable emulsifying agent to form an emulsifiable concentrate when added to water they form emulsions usually of the oil inwater type but occasionally of the water inoil type invert emulsions oil inwater emul sions have the same viscosity as water and can be applied with conventional spraying equipment but special equipment may be needed to apply invert emulsions which may be too viscous to be sprayed by conventional equipment these formulations require continuous agitation to keep them mixed uniformly examples are trifluralin chlorpropham isopropyl 3 chlorophenylcarbamate ester formulations of 24d and related com pounds wettable powders some herbicides are nearly insoluble in water oil or organic solvents therefore concentrated solutions or emulsions cannot be prepared these are made into wettable powders which consist of a finely divided solid herbicide an inert diluent such as clay and dispersing agents deflocculating agents and wetting agents that form suspensions when mixed with water to prevent settling of the solid particles the suspension should be agitated wettable powders are highly effective as soil applied herbicides but are of much lower efficiency when applied to the foliage granules granular formulations vary in shape and size and are usually prepared by spraying a solution of the herbicide onto a preformed granular 488 weeds and weed control in rice carrier or by agglomeration of a powdered mixture of herbicide and carrier some granules dissolve slowly in water and others are insoluble the herbicide in insoluble granules is released slowly to the soil or soil solution granular herbicides even though they are about twice as costly as nongranular ones can be applied by hand in association with fertilizer and may be more acceptable to the farmer nongranular herbicides require water and a sprayer for application furthermore the proportion of the active ingredient in granules is constant whereas other herbicides have to be mixed and applied carefully to obtain the same precision imperfections in application of granules are overcome by diffusion and redistribution of the herbicide in the water numerous herbicides which are formulated as liquid or solids are also formulated in granules examples are thiobencarb s 4 chlorobenzyl diethylthiocarbamate butachlor and 24d waterdispersible slurry the waterdispersible slurry usually consists of a finely divided powder suspended in an oil base which is capable of suspension in water it requires less water only 1020 liters ha for application than conventional herbicides examples are atrazine and fluorodifen 4nitrophenyl 2nitro4trifluoromethylphenyl ether slowrelease compounds methods have been developed to achieve slow or controlled release of pesticides by trapping small amounts of the pesticide in tiny capsules which are then suspended in a liquid the liquid can then be mixed with water and applied through a regular sprayer herbicides are also being formulated as polyvinyl impregnated pellets and clay or casting plaster pellets advantages of controlled slowrelease herbicides are reduced residue levels increased herbicidal activity reduced loss by evaporation or leaching and reduced cost of weed control these formulations have been used primarily for control of aquatic weeds and for weeds in ornamentals herbicides for rice several herbicides are now available to asian rice growers at reasonable cost and many more are being developed to provide effective and economical weed control under the different conditions of various cultural practices by which rice is grown in asia some examples of herbicides for rice are phenoxy acid herbicides herbicides belonging to this group are classified as translocated herbicides examples are 24d and mcpa 4chloro2 methylphenoxy acetic acid propanil propanil is a contact herbicide that controls annual grass weeds and a few broadleaf weeds and sedges fields must be drained to expose the leaves to the herbicide complete coverage by the spray is essential to obtain good contact and effective weed control molinate with early postemergence molinate s ethyl nn hexamethyl enethiocarbamate controls primarily annual grasses but does not control broadleaf weeds and sedges methods of weed control 489 nitrofen nitrofen 24 dichloro4 nitrodiphenyl ether is a selective pre emergence herbicide butachlor butachlor controls most annual grasses broadleaf weeds and sedges and can be applied pre as well as postemergence in tropical asian countries it is available in granular and in liquid formulation in the united states tank or formulated mixtures of butachlorand propanilcontrol many grass weeds and aquatic broadleaf and sedge weeds because of its residual activity it is highly effective on problem soils thiobencarb similar to butachlor thiobencarb is highly effective against most annual grasses broadleaf weeds and sedges remarkable selectivity against echinochloa spp and other weeds and good residual effects make thiobencarb an excellent herbicide for flooded rice bentazon applied postemergence to weeds bentazon 3 isopropyl1 h benzo 2 1 3 thiadiazin4one 22 dioxide spray controls many succulent perennial sedges in flooded rice it is a very safe chemical to use in rice herbicide use is limited to those areas where labor is not plentiful and the wage rates are somewhat high herbicides are extensively used in the united states baker 1978a huey 1977 smith and seaman 1973 australia and europe they are also commonly used in taiwan republic of korea and japan de datta and barker 1977 the choice of herbicide and the timing of its application vary with the type of rice culture chemical control of annual weeds transplanted rice the effectiveness of phenoxy acid herbicides such as 24 d has been demonstrated repeatedly 24 d and mcpa have been used on transplanted rice to control broadleaf weeds and sedges 2 3 weeks after those weeds have emerged vega 1954 vacchani et al 1963 moomaw et al 1966 mukhopadhyay 1978 the time of application to avoid toxicity losses has been found to vary from 15 days to 50 days after transplanting or sowing it has been observed frequently however that early applications of phenoxy acetic acids cause no damage smith et al 1977 and that with suitable cultural practices especially tillage and water management 24d or mcpa may provide as good weed control as the best combination of selective herbicides and hand weeding in fact it was observed in the asian tropics that all commonly marketed formulations and derivatives of 24d and mcpa can control grasses as well as broadleaf weeds and sedges when applied 4 5 days after transplanting de datta et al 1968 de datta et al 1971 some weed species that are susceptible at preemergence of weeds 4 days after transplanting and postemergence of weeds 2530 days after transplanting are listed in table 1216 24d is

butachlor and thiobencarb can be applied as preemergence treatments 45 days after transplanting as well as post emergence treatments 68 days after transplanting propanil is also used in transplanted rice but strictly after weeds have emerged particularly in combination with other weed control practices mukhopadhyay 1978 in the asian tropics propanil application alone however gives incon methods of weed control 491 sistent weed control in rice where irregular rainfall often washes away the chemical or induces a burn of the rice crop de datta 1977c directseeded flooded rice directseeded flooded rice culture will become an acceptable alternative to transplanted rice as the cost of labor rises as less expensive selective herbicides become available and as water control becomes better

at 3355 kgha controls e crusgalli 2575 cm tall 14 leaf stage with little or no injury to rice propanil is ineffective as a preemergence application or when applied to e crus galli at its tillering stage or later smith et al 1977 when e crusgalli has reached the 14 leaf stage rice usually has one or two leaves examples of weeds that are controlled by various herbicides in the united states are shown in table 1217 in a recent test in drillseeded rice in louisiana baker 1978a applied herbicides as preplant preplant incorporated preemergence postemergence or postflood treatments although all herbicide treatments gave a significant degree of weed control only oxadiazon 5 tert butyl 3 24 dichloro 5 isopro poxyphenyl 134 oxadiazo1 2 one applied at emergence gave a significantly higher degree of e crusgalli control than the propanil check table 1218 based on experience in arkansas huey 1977 reported that propanil at 3355 kg ha controls e crusgalli and many broadleaf weeds effectively when applied to rapidly growing grass in the 13 leaf stages 575 cm tall somewhat larger weeds may be killed with higher rates rice may show yellowing and tip burn soon after treatment but plants recover quickly under good growing conditions healthy rice plants are tolerant of propanil at rates as high as 88 kg ha timing of application of propanil should be based on the size of weeds and not on the size of rice weed sizes for effective control with propanil are given in table 1219 temperatures affect weed control with propanil for example an extremely high temperature 35 c enhances the activity of propanil on rice and may cause excessive leaf burn and injury because rapidly growing weeds are most susceptible to propanil sufficient moisture is essential for effective weed control also propanil is a contact herbicide and good coverage of the weeds is necessary flooding should be applied within 45 days to prevent reinfestation by weeds because propanil has no residual activity shallow flooding should be started 24 hours after treatment mixtures of propanil and several new herbicides with residual activity have been table 1217 common rice field weeds and their susceptibility

rice is the major growing system and in asia it is also an important system recent experiments in many parts of the world strongly suggest that chemical weed control in upland rice is not only possible but also effective and economical de datta 1977b much of the further expansion in ricegrowing areas may be as upland culture because most of the potential lowland areas are already cultivated in such new areas suitable weedcontrol practices including use of herbicides will play an important role in increasing rice production for example indonesia has 128 million hectares of upland rice and the area is gradually expanding in southern sumatra and kalimantan if weeds such as imperata cylindrica l beauv and cyperus rotundus can be controlled further increases in area are possible in most latin american countries a combination of mechanical and chemical methods has brought large areas especially in brazil into rice production in many experiments around the world no chemical alone gives as good results as hand weeding but in combination with other weedcontrol measures several chemicals give acceptable weed control many researchers have suggested propanil for weed control in upland rice mukhopadhyay et al 1971 bhan 1978 in ghana propanil plus butachlor appeared promising aryeetey 1973 recent results at irri suggest that butachlor oxadiazon and pendimethalin n 1 ethylpropyl 3 4 dimethyl 2 6 dinitrobenzene amine can be used in upland rice with limited success methods of weed control 495 dryseeded rainfed bunded rice most of the herbicides that have given good weed control in wetseeded or upland rice do not provide sustained weed control many are also phytotoxic particularly when rainfall causes sudden submergence of a field some chemicals such as butachlor thiobencarb butralin and piperophos dimethametryn appeared promising in recent trials despite some phytotoxicity that caused stand reduction table 1220 one followup hand weeding 56 weeks after the herbicide application sometimes helps in minimizing grain yield reduction stand reduction of rice due to herbicide phytotoxicity can be minimized by increasing seeding rates from80 to 100 kg ha with that even if there is as much as 30 stand reduction it has little effect on the final yield herbicide phytotoxicity can be reduced by applying them after a germinating rain rather than applying them immediately after seeding no loss in weed control and in some instances better weed control has been observed when herbicides are applied at that time moody 1977b when the herbicide is applied within 34 days after seeding several weeks may pass before there is sufficient rainfall to provide quick germination during that dry spell herbicides may break down and weed control will be less than desirable than if rain had fallen immediately after seeding despite some problems in improving herbicide effectiveness it seems that herbicides will play a major role in dryseeded rice culture chemical control of perennial weeds perennial weeds pose a serious threat to both lowland and upland rice culture lowland rice in tropical asia perennial weeds such as scirpus maritimus pose serious weed problems in

sime tryn ryang et al 1976 in japan paraquat applied before planting is reported to control e acicularis in rice fields denize 1968 in tropical asia several herbicides have been identified that look outstanding for controlling s maritimus in lowland rice fields for example the selective herbicides bentazon and fenoprop 2 2 4 5 trichlorophenoxy propionic acid gave excellent control of s maritimus in both direct seeded and trans planted rice but with a mixed population of annual weeds and s maritimus no single chemical can control both groups of weeds de datta 1979 upland rice in upland rice c

it is effective against both purple and yellow c esculentus nutsedge takematsu et al 1976 for chemical control of the perennial grass i cylindrica eussen and soerjani 1976 made a detailed review biological control of weeds biological control is the intentional use of living organism to control a pest in the southern united states aeschynomene virginica l bsp weed in rice has factors in integrated weed management 497 been successfully controlled by an endemic fungus colletotrichum gloeospori oides penz sacc f sp aeschynomene the weed is killed about 5 weeks after it is inoculated with conidia of the fungus biological control however has the disadvantage of controlling one specific weed by a particular insect or disease nevertheless biological control offers an important approach for the future with advantages such as lack of harmful residues in crops and in the environment factors in integrated weed management each weed control method has its advantages and disadvantages none is applicable in all cases because weeds vary so much in their growth habits and life cycle there is a growing concern that continuous usage of the same method of weed control such as land preparation interrow cultivation or herbicides will lead to a buildup of weed species that are tolerant of the control method used it is therefore essential to combine or change various methods of weed control if one wishes to avoid possible increased weed problems the concept of pest management or integrated weed control is not new for many years farmers have been using it although perhaps not exactly as it is practiced today the best integrated weed management practices are those that take into account the crop grown weeds infested and the farmers socio economic environment smith and reynolds 1966 defined integrated weed control as a weed population management system that uses all suitable techniques in a compatible manner to reduce weed populations and maintain them at levels below those causing economic injury noda 1977 listed the following weed control methods as components of integrated weed control management preventive land preparation preventive manual weeding mechanical weeding water management crop rotation chemical and biological weed control and other practices such as fertilizer management the combinations of these measures used depend on the rice production practices of each country smith et al 1977 suggested that weed management systems combine cultural mechanical chemical and biological control programs management of cultural and mechanical weed control practices may be used effectively to control specific weeds preventive methods such as use of weed free crop seed use of irrigation water free of weed seed and use of clean equipment are required to avoid weed problems before they begin in rice fields velasco et al 1961 reported that the most feasible and economical schedule for weed control in upland rice was one that involved chemical and mechanical methods as well as cultural practices herbicide selectivity for a given species may lead to infestation of more noxious weeds that were formerly of secondary importance therefore com binations of several weeding methods are likely to prove more effective than a single factor to alleviate buildup of a difficult tocontrol weed or group of weeds 498 weeds and weed control in rice in the past many new control measures were developed and it is likely that many new measures will be developed thus numerous combinations of practices are possible to develop an integrated weed management system in most cropweed situations good water management is effective in controlling or suppressing grassy weeds in flooded rice and a combination of water management with other methods such as a chemical application and soil preparation would provide higher efficiency in weed control in flooded rice the depth and time of flooding govern the infestation level of e crusgalli and leptochloa sp as well as the water management practices that should be used in combination with herbicide applications effective control of those weeds can be achieved by use of clean rice seeds water management fertilizer management and proper application of herbicides such as molinate and propanil smith 1977 in sri lanka rice is often seeded densely to prevent weed emergence during the early stages of rice growth once rice is ahead of weeds harrowing is done to reduce seedling density considerable work is clearly required to develop suitable integrated weedcontrol technology for transplanted directseeded flooded and dryseeded rainfed upland and lowland rice most weedcontrol trials have dealt with a single control practice without considering other control methods the following are examples ofadvantages of multiplefactor methods for integrated weed management in rice transplanted rice in japan by using combinations of chemical mechanical and hand weeding methods of weed control the chances of a complete weed control are vastly improved some practices used by japanese farmers are given in table 1221 the farmers do not necessarily use all of the methods but various combinations of the methods can be used depending on weed species present the degree of infestation and stage of the crop noda 1977 often herbicides have to be followed by one hand weeding or a mechanical weeding for example in a study in india weed control was superior and grain yield was significantly higher when herbicides such as butachlor or propanil were followed by one hand weeding rangiah et al 1974 two hand weedings produced grain yield similar to treatment with chemical followed by one hand weeding studies in the philippines and thailand suggest marked complementarity between fertilizer application and need for a higher weed control measure it is apparent that the benefits from added fertilizer increase markedly with higher level of weed control de datta and barker 1977 in a similar study in bangladesh when fertilizer and weed control were applied together significantly higher yields were obtained than when they were applied singly table 1221

requires irrigation water and the tillage operation requires mainly power and labor all require time when preplant herbicide application was followed by a tillage operation control trends in weed control in rice 501 of weeds was satisfactory and the rice yields were the same as those with conventional tillage fig 125 results confirm that preplant herbicide tillage and the period of flooding may be complementary and possibly compensatory de datta et al 1979 directseeded flooded rice in a recent experiment at irri herbicides were more effective under continuous flooding than when directseeded flooded plots were dry for 28 days then saturated for example the grain yields were significantly higher with thio bencarb followed by 24d than for the untreated control when continuous submergence was not maintained with continuous submergence the grain yields were similar between the untreated control and the herbicide combination of thiobencarb followed by 24d navarez et al 1978 a number of cultural practices help minimize infestation by a specific weed species in directseeded flooded rice some examples of practices that minimize competition from a specific weed species are shown in table 1222 upland rice the effect of variety and tillage on weed control in upland rice was studied with three different varietal types short intermediate and tallstatured and three degrees of tillage one plowing followed by one two or three rototillages one plowing followed by two rototillages had significantly lower dry weed weight than one plowing followed by one rototillage further increase beyond two rototillages did not significantly affect the dry weed weight fig 126 dryseeded bunded rainfed rice in dryseeded bunded rainfed rice the crop begins its life cycle as an upland

herbicides in japan and the republic of korea weeding of almost the entire ricegrowing area is by herbicides because of high labor cost the use of herbicides started with the use of phenoxy acids particularly when granular formulations were developed then pcp pentachlorophenol with a mixture of phenoxy acids became most popular but it was abandoned because of pcp toxicity to fish subsequently several herbicides that were less toxic to fish were used they are chlornitrofen 4nitrophenyl 246trichlorophenyl ether nitrofen prometryn 24diisopropylamino6methylthio135triazine and thiobencarb with a growing infestation of perennial weeds such as cyperus serotinus scirpus juncoides roxb var hotarui ohwi and sagittaria pygmaea miq the control and management of weeds in japan became extremely difficult and the use of herbicides continued to rise because of high labor cost of hand weeding for example in 1975 the saving in labor for weeding was 592 ha noda 1977 some modifications in herbicide use had to be made as more areas were transplanted by machine usually seedlings are transplanted with machine 710 days earlier than hand transplanted fields as a result there is more time for weeds to germinate therefore sequential weeding operations are followed with repeated applications of herbicides table 1221 to sustain mechanical transplanters the soil has to be made firm by repeated puddling during puddling and transplanting more weeds grow as the time between the operations increases in addition rice seedlings for machine transplanting are shorter and are more subject to herbicide injury particularly if 504 weeds and weed control in rice the weather condition is unfavorable herbicides such as chlornitrofen which are least toxic to ordinary seedlings are somewhat toxic to seedlings for machine transplanting and because seedlings are irregularly planted by machine rotary and hand weeding are more difficult in taiwan the cost of hand weeding increased steadily while the cost of herbicides was relatively stable until 1972 weed control systems in taiwan included soil preparation water management two to three weedings by hand and chemicals farmers started to use herbicides in 1966 and use increased steadily 14 of the total rice growing area in 1969 64 in 1971 and 328 in 1973 a recent estimate suggests almost 100 of taiwans rice farmers now use herbicides despite their high cost more selective herbicides such as butachlor are replacing poorer ones for rice in taiwan and the republic of korea koreas rice fields suffer from perennial weed problems similar to those in japan and taiwan as in both of those countries labor cost in korea has increased and chemical weed control has become the most important single method all of these east asian countries must consider integrated methods of weed control if perennial weeds need to be contained beyond the present level of infestation among the tropical asian countries butachlor and thiobencarb are most extensively used the philippines and malaysia use herbicides on 1030 of the ricegrowing area in punjab india butachlor is extensively used in rice fields because of the high labor cost for hand weeding this raises the question of what factors mainly influence the adequacy of weed control it appears to be scarcity of rice land in java indonesia and in taiwan and japan farms are extremely small less than 1 ha and population pressure demands every effort to maximize the return to land by producing yields as high as possible on the scarce land weeds are simply not tolerated by contrast in the philippines and thailand farms are generally larger 23 ha but are generally not so well irrigated thus weeds are frequently a greater problem and less manpower is available to cope with them in those countries it is not uncommon to find farmers who essentially do not weed weedcontrol recommendations of the future will be based on more scientific data than those of today basic knowledge of the biochemistry and physiology of the weeds to be controlled needs to be known and the best method and the time to apply herbicides should be established more precisely for the most effective results flinchum 1975 problems of wild rice and red rice wild rice and red rice as weeds are a serious threat to rice production in many countries in africa and latin america for example in mali 10000 ha out of 30000 ha in the mopti area is infested with wild rice species the problem is equally serious in swaziland red rice has been a serious weed problem in rice problems of wild rice and red rice 505 fields in latin america cheaney et al 1976 and the united states smith et al 1977 sonnier 1978 it reduces yields and lowers the market value of rough and milled rice because seeds are difficult to remove when they are mixed with ordinary rice wild rice species there are a number of wild rice species that invade rice fields some examples are oryza longistaminata chev and roehrich o breviligulata chev and roehrich and o glabberima steud o longistaminata is a rhizomatous rice that thrives in medium to deepwater areas it propagates primarily through rhizomes although reproduction through seeds is possible o breviligulata is easily recognizable at the flowering stage because of its long red awn it grows in deep water and propagates by seeds o glaberrima is a cultivated species of rice however it becomes a difficult weed in areas where o sativa rices are grown all three species are prevalent in mali but o longistaminata is most difficult to control martin and guegan 1973 in swaziland o punctata kotschy ex steud has become a serious threat in many rice fields red rice species red rice oryza sativa l belongs to the same species as the cultivated rice o sativa another red rice species is o rufipogon griff other names for red rice are vermillion red rice italian rice and common red rice there are many types of red ricethose with short medium or long grains those with strawcolored red or black hulls and those with short or long awns on the spikelet smith et al 1977 red rice is an annual that propagates by seed red rice tillers profusely and it is difficult to distinguish it from cultivated rice red rice shatters easily and therefore poses a continuous problem because the seeds remain dormant in the soil control of wild and red rice it is difficult to control wild and red rice in cultivated rice fields because both are rice plants belonging to the same genus or species although there are many cultural practices that can be used to minimize red rice problem there is a need for chemical weed control program which would include chemical control of red rice as well as other weeds 506 weeds and weed control in rice nonselective chemical control chemical control is slightly more expensive than cutting the weeds but because control is better with herbicides they compare favorably with manual cutting or with deep plowing martin and guegan 1973 dalapon and diuron 3 34dichlorophenyl 11dimethylurea have been suggested for controlling o longistaminata at 1015 kgha dalapon can destroy up to 95 of all the rhizomes of o longistaminata when it is 2535 cm tall at 1535 cm height it can be controlled with diuron at 56 kg ha both dalapon and diuron are persistent chemicals therefore fields treated with either herbicide cannot be used for one year for growing any crop recently glyphosate has been evaluated against wild rice species in mali because of its nonpersistent nature glyphosate offers a good opportunity for controlling wild rices for red rice control in cali colombia atrazine at 2 kgha gave excellent control and left no residue after the 30 day flooding period in the experiment the combination ofparaquat and linuron 334dichlorophenyllmethoxy1 methylurea also gave excellent red rice control and left no residue problem after 30 days cheaney et al 1976 herbicide protectants and antidotes herbicide protectants are used to allow increased herbicide doses without injury to the crop or the use of more potent herbicide to obtain a wider spectrum of weed control longer period of weed control or greater reliability for example rice has been successfully protected by pelleting pregerminated seed with activated charcoal which decreased injury from butachlor and oxadiazon but only if the pregerminated rice seed was sown on nonflooded puddled soil nangju 1973 perhaps the success with pregerminated rice is due to the emerged radicle being coated with activated charcoal as there is evidence that charcoal may migrate along the roots selectivity may be governed by one or more factors including herbicide penetration uptake translocation and metabolism one approach to increasing selectivity and the period over which weeds are controlled and to providing greater reliability under varying environmental conditions is the use of an antidote a protectant that works inside the plant to counteract the herbicide rather than merely preventing the entry of herbicide into the plant blair et al 1976 it is also referred to as a chemical safening agent one example of an antidote is na 18 naphthalic anhydride which can be used as a seed dressing to protect a wide range of crops such as sorghum rice and oats as a seed dressing na is used to protect rice and helps control wild rice o punctata rice sometimes is damaged slightly when treated with na at 052 on soils with high nutrient contents parker and dean 1976 smith showed in 1971 that coating with na could be used to protect rice seeds against molinate and thereby make possible the selective control of red rice o economics of alternative weed control practices 507 rufipogon which is very closely related to o sativa this treatment has not been extensively used because of the need for incorporation of molinate into the soil before planting parker and dean 1976 however confirmed the effectiveness of na against molinate and perfluidone injury to rice na can also be used against thiobencarb a herbicide widely used in rice this was shown in a recent experiment with drillseeded rice in louisiana by baker 1978b with seeds of four varieties treated with na at the rate of 1 kg 100 kg seed molinate and thiobencarb which have shown good selectivity in waterseeded rice in previous experiments also showed good selectivity in the drillseeded rice the tolerance of the commercial varieties is marginal to poor when drillseeded of the new herbicides tested only butam 2 2 dimethyl n 1 methylethyl n phenylmethyl propanamide was promising baker 1978b nonchemical red rice control although herbicides provide an excellent opportunity for control of red rice greater attention should be paid to suitable soil management and cultivation techniques such as plowing at the beginning of the dry season for example adequate red rice control can be achieved by good seedbed preparation and crop rotation wherever feasible red rice should be hand pulled continuous flooding also controls red rice as shown by sonnier 1978 who compared three water managements and two rice seedingdate managements on the red rice control in louisiana and found that the behavior of red rice differed greatly at the different seeding dates continuous flooding resulted in the lowest number of red rice plants in both dates of seeding march and april an extremely dense population of red rice occurred under the prolonged drying treatments economics of alternative weed control practices there is a wide variety of direct and indirect methods of weed control for rice it is clear that the optimum combination of weedcontrol practices may differ greatly depending on the type of rice culture and the resources available to the farmer one of the best guides to the choice of alternative weed control methods is the relative cost of labor and chemicals knowing the daily wage rate and the approximate time required for one hand weeding in a given area the cost per hectare of hand weeding can be determined table 1223 and compared with the cost of herbicides it is apparent that at existing wage rates in south and southeast asia chemicals such as 24d which control weeds at about 10ha will be adopted in many areas but the more expensive herbicides are likely to have very limited acceptance unless the wage rate relative to the chemical cost rises fairly substantially such as in japan republic of korea and taiwan de datta and barker 1977 herbicides are frequently looked upon as a threat to employment but an analysis in the philippines suggested that in areas where weed control was 508 weeds and weed control in rice table 1223 cost per hectare for hand weeding at different weeding intensities and farm wage rates from de datta and barker 1977 daily farm cost for hand weeding ha wage rate ha 75 hr 125 hr 175 hr 225 hr 050 075 100 125 470 780 1090 1410 730 1170 1640 2110 940 1560 2190 2810 1170 1950 2730 3520 traditionally poor use of herbicides complemented increased use of labor to raise farm production de datta and barker 1977 in much of tropical asia developing integrated methods of weed control using limited quantities of low cost chemicals in combination with direct and indirect weed control techniques may be the most attractive alternative from agronomic economic and ecological points of view before using any chemicals

rice has increased because of the increased yields possible from the modern rice varieties losses that had been small in absolute terms expanded proportionately with increased farm level yields and the emphasis on increasing rice production by increasing cropping intensity resulted in a crop to harvest at the height of the wet season dictating substantial changes in postproduction operations the problem of determining the magnitude and source of losses in the post production sequence of operations is important and complex all postharvest operations such as handling threshing drying and storage are interdependent the technique employed the timing of each operation and the environment in which they are carried out all contribute to the quality and quantity of rice that farmers ultimately sell or retain for home consumption in tropical asia the magnitude of postproduction losses of the rice crop makes consideration of their causes pattern and eventual control a matter of primary concern duff and toquero 1975 emphasized the close relationship between per formance at the processing level and operations at the farm level when rice is improperly threshed dried and cleaned at the farm level it is impossible to achieve high milling efficiency at the processing plant in most of tropical asia a proper range of rice processing technology particularly for smaller farmers and millers is not yet available at an acceptable cost in addition because markets are fragmented between rural household demand and urban areas investment capital is limited and incentives for new technology are often lacking or distorted the attempts that have been made in most countries to improve rice processing have not focused on the total system but have taken a piecemeal approach that has upgraded some processing components but left others unchanged and has resulted in little or no significant impact on the quality or quantity of rice processed it is important to consider the entire postproduction operation as a system an approach taken in most temperate climate rice growing countries low rice yields in farmers fields may be further aggravated by later losses from antiquated wasteful techniques in postproduction grain handling in the 513 514 postproduction technology of rice tropics these losses both quantitative and qualitative take place at various stages in the harvest and postharvest sequence of operations it is estimated that losses from harvesting through milling amount to about 25 of all rice grain harvested samson and duff 1973 harvesting and postharvest operations in the market place the price of rice is often determined by the appearance of the rice grain rice breeders have included grain appearance and good grain milling quality in their objectives for developing improved varieties but the milling and market quality of rice are greatly affected by harvesting and all other postharvest operations harvesting in the asian tropics rice harvesting is usually done by hand the rice straw is usually cut with a sickle 1525 cm above the ground and either carried away from the main field or dried in place in some areas particularly indonesia and some upland rice growing areas in the philippines only the panicles are removed in china where intensive cropping is practiced rice is completely removed from the main field shortly after harvesting fig 131 in malaysia an estimated 200 combine harvesters 487 m width cut are used in the muda irrigation scheme these harvesting machines are privately owned and appear to be highly profitable the use of such machines is expanding to the other areas of malaysia outside the muda scheme ayob 1979 rayarappan 1979 in japan small self propelled combine harvesters are used 50150 cm cutting width those can harvest 005 hahour in the united states europe and australia rice is harvested with self propelled combine harvesters time of harvest in the tropics it is essential to harvest the crop on time otherwise grain losses may result from feeding by rats birds and insects and from shattering and lodging there is conclusive evidence that both early and late harvests are detrimental to the grain yield and to milling returns of rice faulkner and wratten 1962 langfield 1957 morse et al 1968 timely harvesting ensures good grain quality a high market value and improved consumer acceptance bushel weight bulk density and germination percentage also have been found to be low at early harvest malabuyoc et al 1966 oelke et al 1968 farmers judge their harvest timing by examining the percentage of ripened grains in the panicles the crop should be ready to harvest when 80 of the panicles are straw colored and the grains in the lower portions of the panicle are in the hard dough stage farmers in some south and southeast asian countries harvesting and postharvest operations 515 figure 131 in beijing area in peoples republic of china rice is removed to leave a clean soil surface shortly after harvesting so that rice or other crops can be planted after the first rice crop usually harvest at maturity to minimize field losses resulting from shattering of overripe grains unfavorable weather and pilferage delays in harvest are caused primarily by lack of labor especially during the peak months of harvest in terms of optimum time of harvest for lowland rice nangju and de datta 1970 reported it to be between 28 and 34 days after heading during the dry season and 34 and 38 days after heading during the wet season fig 132 the earlier dry season harvest is due to higher temperature and solar radiation during the ripening period an upland rice crop matures sooner after heading than either a transplanted or direct seeded lowland crop nangju and de datta 1970 showed that applying nitrogen fertilizers to varieties with chalky grains particularly in the dry season improved head rice unbroken polished grains recovery in another study seetanun and de datta 1973 found that a topdressing of nitrogen at heading increased the percentage of head rice which was associated with the higher protein content resulting from the nitrogen treatment based on maximum grain yield with highest milling recovery and seed viability the best time for harvesting transplanted rice was between 30 and 42 days after heading in the wet season and between 28 and 34 days after heading in the dry season 516 postproduction technology of rice figure 132 optimum time of harvest on the basis of maximum grain yield and high percentages of head rice and germination as indicated by percent moisture of the grain at harvest and percent green kernels irri 1968 dry season and wet season adapted from nangju and de datta 1970 from india govindaswami and ghosh 1968 reported that harvesting between 27 and 39 days after flowering at high moisture content 1823 gave maximum head rice recovery harvesting before or after that period resulted in an increase of broken grains horiuchi et al 1971 found that filled spikelet recovery in malaysia was the highest 34 days after heading during both seasons the highest seed and volume weights were obtained from harvest 35 days after heading in japan eikichi 1954 found that the best time to harvest was 2035 days after heading in california some growers reported high head rice yields by harvesting at 2226 moisture in arkansas rice is harvested at 1822 moisture content huey 1977 at that stage the heads have turned downward and the grains in the lower parts of the head are in the harddough stage rice harvested before that stage may have a high percentage of light chalky kernels which reduce yields of head rice and total milled rice if harvested later there may be considerable loss from shattering also there will be a reduction of head rice because of checking stress cracking of the kernels harvesting and postharvest operations 517 cutting height an important consideration affecting the technique of harvesting is the method of threshing and the subsequent use for which the stalks will be used in a philippine study toquero and duff 1974 reported that more than 50 of farmers used a sickle and harvested stalks 6191 cm from the base of the panicle about 30 used a handheld knife aniani that cut the stalks 46 cm or less from the base of the panicle the shorter stalk length facilitates the handling and stacking process in many instances rice straw is used as feed for animals in combine harvesting standing rice is cut just below the heads to reduce the vol ume of stems passing through the threshing and separation units combine cutting height is set primarily to avoid excessive shattering and unharvested grain losses in harvesting wimberley 1972 reported that during the field drying process overmature rice begins to shatter and fall and is lost in the puddled soil germination in the panicles prior to harvesting contributes to loss and birds and rodents add to losses during harvesting and transporting in the philippines an estimated 10 of the rice crop is lost when grains are left in the field to dry to 1416 moisture before harvest de padua 1970 under normal harvesting conditions in thailand total losses run from 60 to 120 kgha fao 1968 recently djojomartono et al 1979 measured harvesting losses from aniani and sickle harvesting of ir36 rice at different maturity levels one level 5 days before and three levels with 3day intervals beyond optimum maturity level based on farmers judgment results showed losses are stable when the aniani is used irrespective of the harvesting date fig 133 a delay in harvesting beyond the stage of grain maturity affects the harvesting field losses as well as the quality of husked rice exogenous factors such as rainy days increase the percentage of broken grains at milling in thailand and the philippines ducks are often used to glean the field for scattered grains after harvesting the rice crop this reduces harvesting losses but unless they own the ducks farmers may not derive any benefit from this practice the effect of combine adjustment and harvest losses of rice was studied by mcneal 1950 his study suggests four types of combine lossesby cutter bar cylinder rack and shoe curley and goss 1964 suggest that several loss checks should be made on a machine in a given area to determine the effect of adjustment or change in ground speed electronic harvester attachments are now available to monitor grain losses in the threshed straw threshing threshing methods for rice vary greatly from country to country the methods are generally classified as manual animal or mechanical 518 postproduction technology of rice figure 133 harvesting losses at different harvesting dates of ir36 rice dry season adapted from djojomartono et al 1979 principle of threshing panicle retention forces vary with the size form and structure of the plant tissue holding the kernels other critical threshing variables are grain weight degree of ripeness and kernel moisture content esmay et al 1979 studies at irri determined the separation of rice grains from the panicle by centrifugal force the separation force was determined to be where f threshing force in kg w g grain weight in kg r average radius of panicle in m n c revolutions per second casem and khan 1968 the common method of separating grain from the panicle is by impact which may be applied by hand beating treading or mechanically by a rotating drum with spikes or rasp bars hand threshing is often done by beating the panicles on a slotted bamboo platform figure 134 shows hand threshing in a farmers field in the philippines occasionally grain is threshed by having animals or humans tread on the harvested crop mechanical threshers are still uncommon in most of tropical asia in some parts of the philippines mainly central luzon some farmers use a mccormicktype thresher these threshers are owned by individuals who provide custom threshing services to farmers the large harvesting and postharvest operations 519 figure 134 hand threshing is done in the philippines primarily by beating the rice heads on a perforated platform made of bamboo machine which cannot be efficiently run by an individual small farmer has a threshing capacity of more than 15 thour duff and toquero 1975 small threshers however either individually owned or custom operated are fast replacing the big threshers types of mechanical threshers there are various throw intype threshers in use in the philippines the bicol type a popular small thresher with a single drum has low efficiency because it has no separation system output per horsepower however is highest of the types tested policarpio and mcmennamy 1978 that machine is rapidly being replaced by irridesigned portable threshers or some modified versions of them several portable power threshers have been designed at irri and are being evaluated in different rice growing tropical countries the large mccormick type thresher that is popular in central luzon philippines has high capacity but is a high horsepower type it requires eight men and a 6580 hp tractor to operate it labor output at 306 kghour is high and total grain loss is a low 412 purity of output is also high compared to that of other types of threshers an irri designed portable axial flow thresher fig 135 has a high labor output of 300400 kghour and a total grain loss of 2 in japan in most of temperate asia and in other temperate rice growing countries in the world harvesting and threshing operations are combined by various sizes of rice combines in general the japonica varieties grown in 520 postproduction technology of rice figure 135 irri designed portable axial flow threshers are now being used by farmers in india sri lanka thailand and the philippines temperate asia are harder to thresh than the indica varieties grown in most tropical asian countries the japanese use a kyowatype double drum thresher that has a blower but no separator an 8hp engine and six men are required to operate the machine and it has a low output per manhour losses in threshing threshing losses vary with the thresher used a study in indonesia suggested that short straw posed problems in feeding the pedal and mechanical threshers and left unthreshed grains at the base of the panicles djojomartono et al 1979 a philippine study by toquero et al 1977 compared threshing losses of four types of machines grain losses were large stationary thresher 814 manual thresher 682 irri designed axial flow thresher 207 irri designed portable thresher 197 drying the moisture content of rough rice must be below 14 before it can be safely stored rice is normally harvested at a moisture content of 20 or more if the moisture content is not reduced to below 14 shortly after threshing grain quality deteriorates because of microbial activities and insect damage according harvesting and postharvest operations 521 to huey 1977 drying should begin within 12 hours but not later than 24 hours after harvesting principles of drying rice like other cereals is a hygroscopic material and will change in moisture content in relation to the temperature and the relative humidity of the surrounding air details on the principles of drying are given by esmay et al 1979 the drying process is basically the transfer of heat by converting the water in grain to a vapor and transferring it to the atmosphere heat is transferred to the kernel for the evaporation process by convection radiation or conduction convection is most commonly used convection drying requires the heating of the air to lower its relative humidity sufficiently to absorb moisture from the grain in most of asia rice grain is commonly dried in the sun although this is difficult during the wet season in general 45 days of sundrying are required to reduce the grain moisture content to an acceptable level at irri however if weather conditions are good one full day in the sun is enough to bring the moisture content from 24 to 14 duff et al 1974 sundrying operations vary greatly from country to country in the philip pines two methods of sun drying are used in the first the harvested rice is placed in loose bundles and left to dry in the field for several days the length of drying time depends on weather practices in the area and the availability of a thresher in the second method immediately after threshing the wet grains are spread on drying surfaces such as concrete pavement mats plastic sheets canvas and so on fig 136 repeated stirring is necessary to obtain uniform drying sundrying can produce grain fissures sun checks which results in low head rice yields and high bran production in milling angladette 1963 good sun figure 136 methods of drying rough rice in three regions of the philippines 1974 from irri 1976 522 postproduction technology of rice drying with frequent stirring can however produce good quality milled rice sundrying requires a large surface area and labor for spreading stirring and collecting the grain and uncertain weather can result in poor control of the drying operations the problem is that most operators do not stir often enough to minimize the differential heating that occurs and results in thermal stress in the grain another problem of sun drying is that if it is not completed quickly it causes fissuring of the grain this often results from the repeated wetting and drying of the grain that can occur as moisture condenses from the air at night kunze and prasad 1978 with increased crop intensification with photoperiod insensitive early maturing rices rice may often be harvested at the peak of the wet season therefore an alternative to sun drying must be developed if substantial losses in quality are to be avoided in japan a simple batch dryer has been used for many years recently circulating batch dryers have gained rapid popularity for on farm rice drying in japan these dryers mechanically load unload or circulate the grain to minimize labor both the simple flat bed and the circulating batch dryer can dry 1015 t in 810 hours khan 1973 such dryers have good potential for adoption in tropical asia provided they are locally produced and made available to farmers at reasonable prices in texas rice is bin dried with unheated or slightly heated air supplemental heat and by multipass drying in continuous flow hot air dryers bindrying is particularly suited for on farm installations because rice handling is reduced to a minimum drying is completed within 1020 days by forcing a low volume of unheated or slightly heated air through a 253 m layer of rice in arkansas combine harvested rice is usually dried by passing it through a multipass heated air dryer at temperatures ranging from 38 to 54 c or it may be put into bins where either heated or unheated air is passed through it until the moisture content is low enough for safe storage rice growers in california ordinarily maintain a rice drying temperature of 35 c the 35 c temperature increased drying speed by 37 over ambient air drying and there was no increase in rice breakage rice temperatures increased with each pass willson 1979 the continuous flow dryers are usually commercial operations in which a large volume of heated air is forced through a thin layer of rice 1025 cm thick during a number of short duration passes between dryer passes the grain is tempered in a storage bin for 624 hours drying is completed within 26 days but the total time during which rice is exposed to heated air in the dryer generally is 2 hours or less calderwood et al 1975 drying rate and temperature unlike most cereals rice is consumed primarily as unbroken kernels so that the market value for whole kernels is much greater than that for broken kernels therefore more care is needed to avoid breakage in drying rice than in drying other cereals johnston and miller 1973 harvesting and postharvest operations 523 to minimize quality deterioration and maximize system efficiency esmay et al 1979 suggested that careful consideration be given to the selection of the drying air temperature the maximum grain mass temperature during drying and the duration of the grain mass exposure to high temperatures at various grain moisture levels the selection of optimal drying conditions also depends somewhat on the rice variety the permitted extreme high drying temperature and the initial grain moisture content as the rice kernel is dried the outer portion shrinks setting up stresses and strains when moisture is removed too rapidly chalking or shattering of the kernel results grain losses in drying mechanical drying produces significantly higher head rice recoveries than sun drying total rice recovery however is usually only marginally greater than that attained after sun drying although the recovery rate is a function not only of the method of drying but also the type of rice mill in which rice is subsequently processed figure 137 summarizes the trends and comparative efficiencies observed in comparing solar with mechanical drying methods at different moisture content at harvest resulting from different harvest dates sundrying of small amounts of rough rice is relatively easy to control and can give a good quality of dried rice in an indonesian study differences in losses due to drying were negligible and difficult to detect djojomartono et al 1979 quality tests showed a head rice percentage of 53 for controlled sundrying compared to 52 for mechanical drying using an irri batch type dryer cleaning cleaning of rice to remove foreign seed and trash is important because of their subsequent effects on the storability and milling quality rice with impurities is more likely to deteriorate in storage impurities also reduce the milling recovery rates particularly if there are stones mixed with the rice unclean rice also increases the maintenance requirements on the milling machines principles of grain cleaning grain cleaning is based on the function of air velocity which is used to separate materials by weight density and wind resistance as air velocity increases from 0 to 200 m minute the percentage of trash removed from grain increases sharply but grain losses are negligible an increase in air velocity beyond 200 m minute provides no improvement in trash removal but increases grain losses grain losses will attain about 1 at an air velocity of 400 mminute harrington 1970 grain cleaning is based on three characteristics of the grain air cleaning takes advantage of differences in the weight and aerodynamic characteristics of the grains in separating them from other materials 524 postproductlon technology of rice figure 137 advantages of mechanical versus solar dryer adapted from duff and toquero 1975 mechanical cleaning uses sieves for separation based on grain size and shape gravity cleaning with cleaners such as rough rice separators uses differences in the specific gravity and bulk density of the grain to separate materials that have little difference in sue and total weight cleaning operation cleaning is mostly done by a hand winnower which takes advantage of wind other rough rice cleaners include the winnowing basket wooden or metal boxes with perforations and a combination of the above duff and toquero 1975 in some areas a manually operated wooden winnower is used for cleaning paddy these are not equipped with screens and high air velocities are used to blow away most of the impurities khan 1973 harvesting and postharvest operations 525 for field cleaning winnowing is undoubtedly most common but mechanical separation often in conjunction with air cleaning is widely used in threshing machines and during rice milling storage rice like other cereal grains is subject to deterioration because of changes in temperature and relative humidity insects and diseases are also more active after increases in temperature and relative humidity principle of storage rice grains will change moisture content until they are in equilibrium with the surrounding air temperature and relative humidity it is generally considered that 13 wet basis moisture content is an acceptable value for rice it is critical to have storage structures that can keep the moisture content and the relative humidity of the grains stable throughout the storage period storage for seeds low temperature and low moisture are necessary for the long term storage of rice for seed adair 1966 ito 1975 ota 1971 nishiyama 1977 evaluated the loss and recovery of germination activity of rice seed stored in controlled humidity he found that rice seed of 1014 moisture content can be stored in good condition at 18 c for more than 2 years however if the moisture content in seed was higher than 19 germination decreased after about a year if the moisture content of seed was between 5 and 6 germination was much lower but the germination rate did not change during 9 months of storage some of the decreased germination activity returned after rehumidification of the seed the use of heated air systems to aerate seed may prevent it from absorbing moisture in storage in the tropics the heated air should also prevent mold growth if the air is below 60 relative humidity in a united states study in kansas seed storage at 44 c and 55 relative humidity resulted in progressive loss of seed viability however storage at high temperatures should have little effect on the food value of rice pfost 1978 in the united states a maximum moisture content of 12 is recommended for seed rice but up to 14 usually is safest in bulk storage storage facilities in tropical asia rice is stored as rough or milled rice rough rice unhusked is stored for home consumption in sacks metal or wooden boxes bamboo baskets cans drums and small granaries if it is stored in large quantities a special room within the farmers house is used rough rice to be sold is stored either in the 526 postproduction technology of rice farmers house or in a warehouse few farmers however store their rough rice in the mills warehouse it is desirable to store rice in gunny sacks on wooden platforms that allow free passage of air between grain sacks and the floor in the warehouse gunny sacks are the most common container for storage but crude bulk storage in which rough rice is piled in one corner of the mill is used by some millers the most important factors in warehouse storage are to store well dried rough rice and to keep the building moisture proof in japan and other temperate rice growing countries rough rice is stored in large storage facilities which are protected from major losses due to insects and rodents for storage bins any construction material is satisfactory if it results in a storage structure that will keep the grain dry cool and free of insects and other pests it should provide safety and convenience for those moving and inspecting the grain johnston and miller 1973 if dried rough rice is to be stored longer than a few months or if damp rice is to be held before drying the storage structure should be equipped for aeration losses in storage losses due to pilferage rats birds and insects are the major rice storage problems in tropical asia the moisture content of dried grains often increases during storage causing bacterial and fungal diseases few farmers in south and southeast asia treat their stored rough rice with chemicals even though it is known that fumigation is the only practical method to control insect damage empty jute sacks often contain insects and should be treated with chemicals or fumigated before use for rice storage insect control depends on proper bin construction and management proper sanitation proper drying of grain proper physical control proper chemical control sanitation can be improved through good housekeeping practices in bulk storage it is essential to provide continuous aeration by forcing a stream of air through grains ratproofing a building consists of changing structural details to prevent the entry of rodents esmay et al 1979 rice processing interest in rice processing activities is related to the possibility of increased yield of milled rice and the potential for low cost increases in output through the use of improved processing systems rice processing 527 parboiling parboiling is a hydrothermal treatment of rough rice prior to milling parboiling affects the milling storage cooking and ultimately consumer preference of rice a comparison of raw and parboiled rice is given in table 131 in the parboiling process rough rice is soaked steamed and redried before milling in the united states and europe parboiling is done with modern equipment but various methods of parboiling are used in india bangladesh pakistan sri lanka burma and malaysia in many areas crude methods are still used parboiling gelatinizes the starch within the rice grain thus causing swelling and fusion of starch within the kernel a preparboiling moisture content of 3035 wet basis and 26 cal of heatkg of rough rice are needed esmay et al 1979 the three important steps for parboiling are soaking sometimes called steeping of rough rice in water to increase its heat treating the wet rough rice usually by steam to complete the drying the rough

is richer in the b vitamins than milled raw rice padua cooked parboiled rice is flakier less sticky than freshly harvested raw rice are strengthened during parboiling and juliano 1974 the disadvantages of parboiling are parboiled rice tends to become rancid during storage longer cooking time is required additional cost and more energy is involved in the drying operation parboiled rice requires more energy to achieve the same degree of milling following parboiling parboiling methods many traditional and modern parboiling processes have been used in different countries most parboiling of rough rice in asian countries is by soaking in large concrete tanks and steaming in small kettles using a small metal tank for soaking and steaming without using a boiler using large metal tanks for soaking and steaming with a boiler these methods have proven economical over many years of operation each method when operated properly produces good quality parboiled rough rice at a minimum operating cost wimberley 1980 the most conventional method of parboiling consists of soaking the rough rice and then steaming it the parboiled rice is then dried in the sun the process takes from 24 hours to several days depending on the weather care is taken to use clean water and rice free of foreign matter experimentally khan et al 1973 used ultrahighconduction drying of rough rice at temperatures of 100200 c which reduced the moisture content of the rice from about 28 to 18 in a few seconds rice was simultaneously parboiled and dried to about 18 by placing it in contact with heated sand in the laboratory the high temperature drying process produced a high gelatinization of the starch granules which fused sunchecks and other fissures the fusing process resulted in higher output of head rice after milling in the united states the rough rice is dried after parboiling by putting it through a continuousflow mechanical dryer if mechanical equipment is used for drying a sequence has been worked out for a more uniform operation the sequence of operation is important for two reasons rice processing 529 the plant is designed for a given capacity with a certain sequence of maximum utilization of equipment gives the lowest operation cost the following is the sequence of operation for one batch of rough rice of one ton or more the sequence can be paralleled with other batches using staggered times thus giving a continuous operation maximum use of equipment and maximum capacity operation if not followed daily capacity drops considerably step a b c d e operation loading water and rough rice into the parboil tank soaking and steaming moving rough rice to the dryer drying moving the rough rice to the tempering bins tempering second drying pass total time required hour 1 4 3 6 3 17 the parboiling processes are described in detail by wimberley 1980 milling rice milling involves the removal of hulls and bran from rough rice to produce polished rice milling ranges from hand pounding with the simple wooden mortar and pestle in many remote areas of south and southeast asia and west africa to the modern equipment developed in japan europe and the united states a great quantity of rice is lost during the milling process therefore milling requires careful planning and use of properly designed and operated equipment a good rice milling operation should produce the maximum yield of edible rice obtain the best possible quality minimize losses minimize the processing cost esmay et al 1979 milling recovery time of harvest and season affect the milling yield of rice in an irri study the percentage of head rice decreased with time less abruptly in the wet season than in the dry season fig 138 earlier and more severe breakage of the grains due to suncracking occurred during the dry season seetanun and de datta 1973 530 postproduction technology of rice figure 138 effect of time of harvest on the percentage of total milled rice and head rice

its quality are highly affected by the milling process and equipment used in many rural areas hand pounding is still practiced with various indigenous devices the percentage yield of whole kernels from those hand pounding devices is low three types of mills are generally usedthe steel huller engelberg type the under run disc sheller cono system and the modern mill the steel huller engelberg type removes the husk and bran in one operation the under run disc sheller mill cono system has a cleaner disc shelling units a separator and cone type polishers the modern rice mill has extensive provisions to remove foreign matter dehusk the grain remove and rehusk unhulled grains remove the bran layer grade rice by separating broken grains from head rice and whiten to put a final polish on the milled grain some have automatic blending and bagging facilities engelberg type the most popular rice milling equipment in many areas is the simple engelberg type about 53 of the rice produced in the philippines is rice processing 531 processed by this type of mill the engelberg mill has a high power requirement and subjects rough rice to excessive pressure and friction resulting in heating low milling recovery and high grain breakage the milling recovery of the steel huller mill is 6063 compared with 6870 in modern mills wimberley 1972 to improve performance and reduce loss some engelberg operators recycle the grain two or three times or arrange two or three steelhullers in series the inefficient performance of this rice mill causes enormous loss of grain the by products of milling are often used for animal feed the steel huller has the advantages of low initial cost ease of operation and maintenance it can mill smalllot sizes conveniently and economically most engelberg mills are operated as a parttime family enterprise and payment for milling is usually in byproducts or as a percentage of the milled rice the engelbergs appear to have considerable utility in most areas because of their wide dispersal convenient to most farm households production of byproducts for livestock feeding and low cash requirements for operation until transport systems and marketing practices are improved or a comparable low cost alternative practice is available it is unlikely the engelberg will be replaced cono system the cono system mill processes the greatest share of rice entering the commercial market it usually consists of one or more underrun disc sheller units operated in conjunction with a number of vertical cono polishers materials are fed into a central opening and centrifugal action causes radial movement of the rough rice into the space between the discs in the philippines cono installations produce appreciably higher recovery rates up to 68 by weight than the engelberg unit in addition head rice recovery is higher bran and hulls are separated and the degree of milling can be closely controlled duff and estioko 1972 some alternative rice milling systems are shown in fig 139 modern mills modern milling equipment has the rubber roller system which was developed in japan it consists of two closely spaced rubber rollers rotating in opposite directions at different speeds contact with the rubber rollers creates a shearing action on rough rice which removes the husk from the grain operated in conjunction with an aspirator and paddy separator it is possible to recycle unhulled paddy through the machine to achieve complete hulling when correctly adjusted for optimal operation the rubberroll method produces the highest total recovery and best head rice yield despite its high technical efficiency however high investment costs combin ed with a lack of demand for highquality rice have retarded diffusion of this technology in south and southeast asia furthermore they are often run at a loss because of the highvolume requirement of modern rice milling systems 532 postproduction technology of rice figure 139 alternative rice milling systems adapted from duff and estioko 1976 110 thour which is usually not guaranteed in big mills in south and southeast asia milling efficiency evaluation and comparison of milling efficiency should be based

milling process the products of each operation are shown directly below and the by products are shown on the side milling potential the milling potential of rough rice can be ascertained as follows to gauge the performance of a huller the coefficient of hulling and wholeness must be determined irri 1978 the coefficient of hulling indicates the quantity of rough rice actually dehusked during a single hulling pass the coefficient of wholeness indicates the quantity of unbroken brown rice in the brown rice yield this breakage can be the result of the huller performance or can be related to the quality of the rough ricecracked grain moisture content and so on grades and standards 535 the efficiency of a huller can be determined using the equations from camacho et al 1978 hulling efficiency coefficient of hulling coefficient of whole ness 100 where coefficient of hulling wt of brown rice wt of sample mixture of rough and brown rice coefficient of wholeness wt of whole brown rice wt of sample mixture of whole and broken brown rice glossary of terminology the terminology used in postharvest technology and rice quality are summarized in table 133 grades and standards rough rice grades and standards are applied to rice with the hull on it after the rice is milled a set of milled rice standards is applied the latter permits a more precise measure of value most pricing of rice is based on a milled sample or on the grade of the entire lot after milling milled rice grades for export market in thailand thailand is the leading exporter of rice in asia and a leading rice

sand dust etc which are foreign to milled rice rice with any degree of redness a systems approach to postproduction operations 537 whole grain means the full kernel without any broken part the grades and grade requirements are shown in table 134 united states grades and standards for rough and milled rice in the united states the primary factors relating to rough rice grade are seeds and headdamaged kernels red rice chalky kernels and rice of other classes for each of these factors a tolerance has been established and limits are also stated for each grade table 135 a systems approach to postproduction operations in temperate countries the entire sequence of postharvest operations is highly mechanized and has developed into an interdependent system harvesting threshing milling storage and marketing operations are closely interrelated this has led to a highly developed postproduction system that results in minimal losses in quantity and marketable quality of rice as a result of mechanization of postproduction operations the risk and uncertainty to the rice farmer are reduced in tropical asia mechanization of postharvest operations is limited however several new machines for threshing cleaning and drying have been designed by irri and other national centers and offer the opportunity to partially mechanize the postharvest operations but the approach to improved post harvest operations is often piecemeal for example one program deals with improvement of storage facilities another with improving drying operations and still another with better milling such independent programs may be beneficial but savingsof time and costsare often possible when all compon ents are viewed as interdependent and development attempts integrate these components to produce more efficient operations the interdependent nature of all postharvest operations means each operation should be treated with an awareness of its interaction with others for example if harvesting is carried out at the wrong time or using the wrong method it may be impossible to dry mill or store the resulting crop properly this can result in poor quality rice figure 1311 shows a simplified diagram of postharvest operations wimber ley 1980 suggests using a systems approach to reduce costs and improve efficiency that includes matching the cleaning and drying facilities to purchasing programs adjusting storage capacities to receiving and milling schedules and matching milling capacities and facilities to the storage system and rice distribution requirements this systems approach assures maximum utilization of existing facilities and minimum investment in new facilities resulting in the lowest possible operation cost the size of storage and processing plants is also a major consideration large plants have higher investment costs but lower operation costs and use fewer table 134 standards of white rice stipulated by ministry of commerce thailand adapted from board of

interrelationships among factors within the system which are in the nature of agronomic technical and economic relationships their results suggest that mechanized threshing will enjoy wider acceptance in the future however with the range of existing technologies farmers will still favor sun drying for some time to come it is obvious that a systems approach to all postharvest operations must be

highest in the world and in many of them the rate of population increase is alarming table 141 demands for rice are expected to increase in the next decade approximately in line with population increases and countries that have traditionally exported rice may face difficulty in producing food enough for their own population demand for rice to determine the demand for rice planners generally consider four factors population growth rates current levels of income and expected increase in real income the income elasticity of demand for rice which provides the relationship between changing incomes and changing purchases of rice anticipated changes in rice prices when compared to substitute foods for example maize and wheat of these factors population growth rate is generally the most important determinant of the increase in the demand for rice with a world population of more than 45 billion in 1980 the worlds population will increase by about 90 million people in the coming year at least 45 million of those will depend on rice as their major source of food an annual production increase of 9 million tons of rice will be required to maintain the present level of food consumption thus the best estimates are that the needed growth rates in cereals will be in the 2235 range of this increase 90 will be due to population effect and about 10 to an income effect for output to grow within this range and for rice to retain its current share of food supplied rice supplies must grow at the same rate they have for the past 15 years colombo et al 1977 ifpri 1977 fao

no nearer to solving the food problem than it was a decade ago rice which has tended to be a prestige food is becoming an increasingly important part of the diet in latin america because of population growth the increasing world population should also result in a potential export market for latin american rice kirpick 1977 in africa rice is important to economies of many countries particularly in west africa these countries are among the least self sufficient in rice production importing about 30 of their total requirements there is increasing dependence on imported rice because of urbanization and higher wage rates rice is also progressively replacing sorghum and millet the traditional cereals in the savanna and sahelian areas and the root and tuber crops in the forest zones aw 1978 in environments favorable to rice growth modern technology has increased rice yields and productivity development of modern technology alone however may not increase yields and production of rice in a given country the technology must be tested and adopted on farms and any constraints at the farmer level determined in some instances the technology will need to be modified based on the results from the farm level testing the issues of development of modern rice technology and understanding of constraints must be addressed together to generate enough food for the worlds growing needs 548 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply technological changes in rice production perhaps the most significant development in agriculture in south and southeast asia during the past decade has been the shift from traditional agriculture to modem agriculture using science based technologies this shift was made possible mainly by the adoption of new fertilizer responsive varieties of rice and wheat these high yielding varieties occupy about 28 of the worlds rice growing area and 44 of the wheat growing area table 142 the rate of adoption of the new cereal varieties has varied greatly between countries and between areas within countries the differences in the adoption table 142 areas of the high yielding varieties expressed as a proportion of total area of wheat and rice

table 143 shows the trend in adoption rate of modern rice varieties in selected countries in south and southeast asia in many countries however yield per hectare has not increased at a rate corresponding to the rate of adoption of modern varieties for example in pakistan where climate and adequate irrigation favored the new rice technology annual growth in yield has exceeded 6 on the other hand in thailand and burma two traditional net exporters of rice yields have been relatively stagnant and the annual production growth has been less than 1 this low growth rate is due largely to uncontrolled crop water which has prevented greater adoption of modern rice varieties in countries such as indonesia malaysia philippines and sri lanka a rapid growth in output of rice has been achieved by increasing the area irrigated and good adoption of modern technology such as improved seed and increased fertilizer rates development testing and adoption of modern rice technology the concept of a good plant type for high fertilizer response and high rice yields was developed and has been perfected in japan highyielding varieties are grown almost entirely under complete irrigation as a result japans rice yields have steadily increased over the years despite abundant fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals and a price support of rice to promote increased rice production in japan there still remains a gap between the potential and actual yield of rice in that country average rice yields of japanese farmers are 3040 of the 1517 tha potential yield for temperate regions suggested by plant scientists irri 1978a in tropical asia rice yields have been low for many centuries for india indonesia and the philippines rice yields average 1215 of the potential of 1315 t ha per crop irri 1978a reasons for those low yields are warm day and night temperatures high humidity low light intensity and the poor rice varieties the tall vigorousgrowing profusetillering latematuring photoperiod sensitive indica varieties have been grown in most of south and southeast asia for centuries rice yields have been low but stable the tall types of rice tolerate relatively deep water compete well with weeds and grow on soils with low fertility another reason for the low rice yields in the tropics is that pest management and fertilizer practices are not adequate at the farm level to achieve the potential yields in farmers fields even in irrigated fields in rainfed areas hardly any modern technology has been available that could increase grain yield of rice in 1962 the rice breeders at irri put together a set of objectives for development of highyielding varieties with a high nitrogen responsiveness that was not found in commercial varieties grown in the tropics see chapter 6 550 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply the modern rice technology the new plant type for rice that received worldwide attention in the mid1960s is represented by the development of ir8 it is characterized by short stature and stiff straw and differs markedly from the tall weakstem plant type of the traditional indica rice varieties in favorable environments the new rice varieties respond to increased applications of chemical fertilizer with high yields thus the modern technology associated with the highyielding varieties is often called the seedfertilizer technology associated technology was developed but is less known primarily because of the overriding impact of the ir8 plant type thus modern rice technology has been associated primarily with the development of modern rices testing of modern rice technology all rices in the early irri rice breeding program were evaluated in fields with good control of irrigation water and the best crop production technology available at that time breeding lines were tested under continuous flooding and the fertilizer rates applied to the tests far exceeded those practiced by the best farmers of the region agronomic testing was limited to the advanced breeding lines and was structured to cater to the varying soil fertility conditions but even the poorest philippine soils see chapter 3 on which the early breeding lines were tested are rich soils compared with many ricegrowing soils in the region adoption and spread of new rice technology it became apparent in the early 1970s that the original new rice varieties are environmentspecific and perform best where there is an adequate supply of water and high solar energy because the oftenused term highyielding varieties or hyv gave the misleading impression that such rices give high yields under all conditions the terminology for the new rices has been changed to modern varieties or mv the subsequent development of modern rice varieties with more resistance to insects and diseases and with improved quality taste and appearance and expansion of irrigated areas helped to extend the area grown to modern varieties newer modern varieties more suited to local conditions helped increase the spread of the improved plant type but despite these technological advances the modern varieties had spread to only about 30 of the ricegrowing area in asia by 19761977 table 142 the most rapid adoption of modern rices has taken place in india indonesia and the philippines there has been adoption of the new varieties but at a slower rate in burma thailand and pakistan two reasons are cited for slow adoption of modern rices in thailand development testing and adoption of modern rice technology 551 poor grain quality shortstatured rices have not been suitable to the poor water control conditions which is also true for burma in pakistans punjab region the spread of the modern varieties has been slow because premium prices have been paid for locally produced basmati rice for export studies by agricultural economists in six countries in south and southeast asia determined that wide variability exists in the level of adoption of modern varieties across the ricegrowing areas of asia including the irrigated areas covered by the study factors contributing to the variability are seasonal suitability of the rice variety the degree of water control and profitability irri 1978b the first modern varieties were shortstatured and under the ideal conditions of good irrigation and high level of cultural practices responded well to high levels of fertilizer particularly during the sunny dry season although medium statured varieties appear to have a lower yield potential than the shortstatured rice the mediumstatured rices have fared well because of greater tolerance for unfavorable soilwater environments and they are still popular in many areas of south and southeast asia in some study areas local varieties have remained popular because these areas have poor drainage and are unsuitable for the modern rices impact of new rice varieties on cultural practices one very significant change that has taken place with the introduction of modern varieties is the increased use of fertilizer particularly nitrogen in a sixcountry economic study it was found that the average village yield positively correlates with the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied fig 141 it was also found that a high level of nitrogen 80 kg nha is associated with a high proportion of the land planted to modern varieties when village average yields are calculated separately for modern varieties and local varieties most of the average yields exceeding 4 tha have been obtained with modern varieties using 90 kg nha or more fig 142 the range in fertilizer input has been greater for modern varieties than for local varieties with the modern varieties wherever the rate of fertilizer application has been low it has been due either to high fertilizer price or low price of rice sometimes both factors have deterred use of high or optimum rates of fertilizer yeartoyear and sitetosite variability in fertilizer response has been another factor that often discourages use of the recommended rate of fertilizer for modern varieties fig 143 weed control is another cultural practice that has been significantly altered with the introduction of modern varieties for years rice farmers in tropical asia have depended on tall vigoroustillering plants to provide competition to weeds 552 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply figure 141 relationship between nitrogen level and average farm yield per hectare by village wet and dry seasons selected villages in asia 19711972 from barker 1978 figure 142

introduction of the modern semidwarf rices weed problems have become more serious this is because the modern rices provide less of a crop canopy which allows more light to reach the weeds furthermore the use of high fertilizer rates also increases weed problems with modern cultivars nevertheless the ir8 plant type with its high tillering capacity is fairly competitive with weeds with the introduction of modern varieties timing of weeding has had to be altered it is critical to weed early maturing rices earlier than late maturing constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields 553

respectively 19681972 wet seasons adapted from barker 1978 rices because fast growing barnyard grass type echinochloa spp weeds damage earlymaturing rice more than late maturing rice manipulation of plant population is another cultural practice that has had to be altered with the introduction of modern rices generally with modern rices close spacing is essential to minimize weed infestation and obtain high yields see chapter 12 constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields in studies in 30 asian villages 25 social scientists in six countries cooperated to determine socioeconomic constraints restraints to high yields of rice where modern rice varieties have been well accepted irri 1978b it was found that farmers grow modern varieties more widely in the dry than in the wet seasons the farmers consider lack of good water control insects and diseases the most serious constraints to high yields for modern varieties in some countries government policies discourage acceptance of the new technology in others particularly those where deep flooding is common suitable modern varieties have not been developed and in villages where substantial land is planted to crops other than rice incomes are significantly higher than in villages where only lowland rice is grown irri 1978b 554 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply figure 144 lack of water appears to be the single most important constraint to high yields in a preliminary aggregate study ona national basis in the philippines from herdt and wickham 1975 in an aggregate study of the factors that restrict yields on a national basis in the philippines it was reported that lack of water control is the single biggest yield constraint and is responsible for about 35 of the difference between potential and actual yields fig 144 seasonal factors such as available solar radiation account for another 20 of the yield difference and economic factors including risk account for 15 of the difference many of these constraints can be reduced or manipulated by appropriate financial investments policy changes research and selective breeding for example the construction of irrigation and drainage systems and modification of their management can alleviate poor water control policy measures to insure available credit and favorable prices can ease economic constraints fertilizer inputs might be reduced if varieties or farming systems can be developed to increase efficiency of soil or fertilizer nutrients year toyear variability due to weather conditions can be eased by developing rices that tolerate drought and submergence or that yield well under the low solar radiation of the wet season insect and disease damages can be reduced by incorporating a higher level of pest resistance into modern varieties research in national and international programs has focused on these issues since the early 1970s an interdisciplinary study of the technical and socioeconomic constraints to increased rice production was undertaken by scientists at irri and in national rice research programs in several asian countries they have developed a methodology to investigate the constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields combining an experimental and a survey approach constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields 555 development of methodology for studying farm yield constraints rice yields on farmers fields in tropical asia are lower than those commonly obtained in experimental plots the gap between experiment station yields and actual farm yields is referred to as the yield gap the factors responsible for the gap are referred to as yield constraints reasons for the gap are the so called improved technology that is varieties and associated crop expectations for the technology onfarm have been unrealistically high potential yields of the technology are not fully expressed in the poor farmers objectives are different from researchers and farmers do not the supply of inputs markets and infrastructure prevents the farmer from management has not been adopted by farmers environments often found on farmers fields attempt to maximize yields realizing the higher yields he wishes herdt and wickham 1975 the general approach and basic concept the approach to determining yield constraints involves the conduct of controlled agronomic experiments on farmers fields and farm surveys a research team is usually composed of agronomists agricultural economists and at times statisticians the concept on which the approach is based is illustrated in fig 145 the model divides the yield gap into two parts by introducing an intermediate yield level representing the potential farm yield or yield obtained in farmers fields using the modern technology the first part yield gap i is the difference between experiment station yield and potential farm yield it exists mainly because of environmental differences between experiment stations and the actual rice farms the technology that gives high yields on experiment stations may not give nearly as high yields in the less favorable environments that exist in much of the rice growing areas of asia there may also be some components of the technology that are not transferable from the experiment station to the farmers fields the primary objective of the constraints research at the farm level is not to examine yield gap i although its size can be assessed but to focus on yield gap iithe difference between the potential farm yield and the actual farm yield this gap exists because farmers use inputs or cultural practices that result in lower yields than those possible on their farms it is possible to examine the gap in two parts one is to identify what biological or physical inputs or cultural practices account for the gap the other is to identify why farmers are not using the inputs or cultural practices that would result in higher yields on their own farms the

food supply figure 145 the concept of yield gaps between an experiment station rice yield the potential farm yield and the actual farm yield from gomez 1977 levels of fertilizer and insecticide correct existing soil problems and use the best cultural practices the most critical factors differ from one region to another but before any remedy can be taken such as recommending a package of improved practices the biological nature of the gap must be understood that makes experiments on farmers fields essential the socioeconomic constraints explain why farmers do not use the prapices and inputs necessary to obtain maximum yields the reasons may include economic calculations of costs and returns lack of knowledge of how to use the technology lack of credit poorly operated irrigation systems nonavailability of inputs or traditional beliefs the importance of these factors will differ from area to area but understanding them will help in designing programs to provide the missing biological components to overcome the yield gap farm surveys provide the main research inputs for this aspect gomez et al 1979 irri initiated constraints research that led to formalization of a network called international rice agro economic network iraen focused attention on yield gap ii objectives of the methodology the general objective of the methodology for studying farm yield constraints is to identify the factors that explain the difference between actual and potential rice yields in selected farm environments the specific objectives are constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields 557 to measure the gap between the actual yield of farmers and the potential yield or the yield with production techniques or input levels of maximum yields in their physical environments to determine the contribution of each tested input or cultural practice to the gap between actual and potential yield to determine the extent to which use of each tested technical factor can be profitably increased to determine what social and institutional factors prevent farmers from using technology that gives higher more profitable yields to determine whether it is possible to change the physical and socioeconomic factors constraining yields and the difficulty if any of making such a change methodology for quantifying biophysical constraints standard research methodologies have been developed to study biophysical constraints to high rice yields de datta et al 1978 three fundamental characteristics of the constraints research methodology were considered before embarking on the task the first objective of the research approach is to understand constraints from the viewpoint of the farmer second the focus of the research is on farmers fields with an attempt to simulate reality to ensure that the results would be indicative of what farmers could achieve third the project is collaborative between agronomists economists and statisticians components of the methodology a new field plot technique has been developed to identify and quantify the constraints to high yields in farmers fields several field experiments have been conducted in the philippines and in five other south and southeast asian countries to accurately estimate the potential farm yield the actual farm yield and the intermediate levels representing varying combinations of input use two sets of treatments the factorial component and the management package component have been tested in the experiments factorial component the concept and design of the factorial component were developed by gomez et al 1973 and modified later by gomez 1977 the treatment consists of either complete or incomplete factorial combinations of n factors or production inputs each at two levels the two levels of each factor are the farmers practice and the improved practice 558 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply the farmers practice refers to what the farmer is actually doing in the current crop season and hence varies from one farm to another the improved practice is the one recommended for maximum yield and should be fixed for all farms in a given location data collected on different test farms will estimate the yield gap gap ii of fig 145 the individual contributions of the n test factors to the yield gap management package component the management package concept was developed by de datta et al 1976 to test intermediate levels of inputs or technology between the farmers set of practices and the improved or recommended set of practices the incremental steps between treatments usually involve a simultaneous change in more than one input the management package component tests the different input combinations selected to represent different yield levels and production costs study of this component allows a meaningful look at the question of costs and returns for each management package furthermore one or more of these intermediates should be good candidates for an immediate recommendation to farmers socioeconomic studies for determining farm yield constraints the socioeconomic studies include economic analysis of the experimental data and farm surveys economic analysis of experimental results to meet the third objective of the methodology see objectives of the methodology economic analysis on cost and return of all experimental data is carried out by country and by season farm surveys to meet the third and fourth objectives farm surveys are carried out in the same region of a country where the experiments are laid out however surveys could cover more areas than those used for the experimental sites one preliminary survey is done prior to the establishment of the experiments it obtains information on farm size tenure status of the farmers farming practices productivity level technology awareness irrigation facilities credit labor availability and prices a detailed survey is carried out as a followup study at the end of the crop season in which experiments are carried out the followup surveys include information on variety grown farmers management and cultural practices constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields 559 yield level farmers perception of factors that limit the yield and the remedial measures constraints research process figure 146 diagrams the constraints research process and the relationship of the methodology to the goal of agricultural developmentincreased production profit and rural employment attaining that goal requires that new technology appropriate to the environment be extended to farmers an opportunity for profitable sales of farm output must also exist if production does not increase or does not increase at an appropriate rate the reasons are sought when the new technology is used in farmers fields are yields increased over those with use of the farmers technology if not what factors restrict yields answers here provide feedback to researchers and enable them to design more appropriate technology if yes is the new technology more profitable than the technology now used by farmers if not it is not reasonable to expect it to be adopted is the level of profitability restricted by government policies if so can the policies be changed or can the technology be redesigned answers here provide feedback to policy makers and researchers do farmers have a level of knowledge adequate for effective use of the technology are the necessary inputs and cash or credit required to use the technology available to farmers if not how can government programs ensure the availability of such inputs answers here provide feedback to government programs and to the extension system actual farm yields are easy to define they are what farmers get for purposes of the project potential yield was defined as the highest yield obtained in farmers fields with improved technology de datta and herdt 1979 the constraints project did not attempt to explain or identify the constraints to rice production imposed by circumstances outside the control of farmerspol icies of government weather soil conditions water available in the irrigation canals and similar factors operating at a level beyond the control of farmers working on their farms finally the constraints project did not attempt to explain the existing level of land use intensity or explore how that could be overcome through engineering or technological innovations it did not identify constraints to intensification herdt 1979 a detailed methodology is described in a handbook developed at irri de datta

buri sam chook pho phaya and chanasutr irrigation projects 562 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply season yields were quite high about 5 tha and the high levels of inputs failed to increase yields farmers in those two areas were already using high inputs and getting high yields dryseason constraints experiments were on 366 farmers fields at the 10 sites between 1974 and 1977 farmers yields averaged 43 tha whereas yields with the high inputs were 56 tha for an average yield gap of 13 tha table 144 at three sites the yield gap was only about 05 tha in the dry zone of sri lanka and subang indonesia both farmers yields and the yield gap were low indicating that the technology applied could not overcome the constraints taiwan also showed a small gap but in that case it was because the farmers were already close to the potential yield contribution of biophysical constraints to yield gaps the constraints experiments were designed to enable the analyst to separate the yield gap in the components attributable to each variable factor tested in the experiments at each site the researchers identified practices that farmers were not considering or inputs that were being applied at inadequate levels those factors became the test factors in the experiments two to four factors were generally chosen because a larger number made the experiment too large to conveniently conduct in farmers fields fertilizer and insect control were the most frequently used test factors others included weed control variety plant spacing land preparation organic manure and various separate fertilizer elements based on the averaged data for all six collaborating countries fertilizer application rate and timing have been the most limiting factors for high yields in the dry season in the wet season insect control and fertilizer management have been about equal in importance in contributing to high rice yields fig 147 detailed results on all of these studies from six countries were published by irri irri 1979 farmtofarm variability in yields it is unclear why in a given climatic zone variability in rice yields exists not only among farmers but also among researchers managing farmers fields to explain the farmtofarm variability experiments were conducted during 19741977 in one philippine province and the results were classified according to farmers yields the 25 of sites with the highest farmers yields and the 25 of sites with the lowest farmers yields were identified for the wet and dry seasons herdt and mandac 1979 for convenience these were called topyield and bottomyield farms and grouped as shown in fig 148 herdt and mandac 1980 and irri 1980 identified the factors contributing to the yield differences in the wet and dry seasons fig 149 in the wet season the managed inputsfertilizer insect control weed control and seedling agecontributed little to explain the difference between the low and the high constraints to high rice yields in farmers fields 563 figure 147 difference in yields attributed to inputs duringdry and wet seasons data are averages of 19741977 in six countries in asia bangladesh indonesia philippines thailand taiwan and sri lanka yield crops environmental parameters and a combination of weather related factors and insects and diseases were the major factors causing the yield differences among farms and accounted for some 80 of the yield differences the dry season results were in contrast to the wet season nonmanaged factors accounted for some 4050 of the yield differences the remainder was due to the levels of managed inputs used and their interaction with environmental variables these analyses indicate that the yield potential of the existing modern rice technology can be realized only with favorable environmental conditions socioeconomic constraints economic evaluation of new technology must be an integral part of constraints research economic evaluation however is complex one major problem is that when farmers adopt technology they utilize it at a completely different level than the researchers as a result yields and rates of return are quite different an economic analysis of the experimental data from six south and southeast asian countries was made in 1978 in experiments subjected to economic analysis of cost and return on the farmers yields the average yield was 35 tha and the yield gap about 1tha the value of increased rice output was calculated at prevailing local prices and local currencies were converted to dollars at the rates prevailing in 19751977 the high inputs increased yields by 04 t ha and value of output by 50 ha or more in all wet season cases table 145 the cost of the high inputs averaged 40 more than farmers were spending on the same inputs in some

from one of 10 sites in six asian countries 19741977 from herdt and mandac 1979 seasons but the added yield contributed by high inputs was greater in the dry season this breakdown by input shows that the application of higher levels of fertilizer in the dry season appears to give a sufficiently high return above added cost to generate a strong incentive for its use generally however high insect control is not sufficiently attractive for farmers to use it separating technical and economic inefficiency when the rice con straints experiments were analyzed at irri it became apparent that researchers were recording higher yields than farmers even when they both used about the same levels of inputsin this case fertilizer fig 1411 this observation has raised the issue of how much of the yield gap is a result of farmers apparently being less technically efficient than researchers and how much because farmers simply use lower levels of inputs figure 1412 shows how the efficiency issue can be conceptualized by demonstrating how the yield gap can be partitioned into three components the first segment of the gap that due to profit seeking behavior reflects the difference in input level resulting in maximum profit versus maximum yield the second segment referred to as price or allocative inefficiency reflects the farmers failure to use inputs to the points of maximum profit the third gap technical inefficiency is defined as the failure to produce on the most efficient production function if one or more of the inputs has been systematically varied in the management packages the researcher is then provided with the data de datta et al 1979 to estimate the response function depicted in fig 1412 570 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply figure 1411 return over cost of variable inputs for four levels of fertilizer inputs and two levels of weed and insect control inputs average of nine experiments in farmers fields nueva ecija 1977 from mandac and herdt 1979 institutional constraints considerable attention has been given in the literature to the potential impact of tenure credit limitation and relative prices as factors depressing farmer incentives generally prices of rough rice and urea fertilizer represent the relative incentive to use modern technology and the ratio of these prices varied greatly among the sites in the iraen studies the different price ratios had a direct effect on the farmers use of inputs and therefore affected the yield gap figure 1413 illustrates the effect in the dry season in those areas where the price of urea relative to rice was high the yield gap attributable to fertilizer was also high in the areas whereit took less than 08 kg of rice to buy 1 kg of urea the yield gap attributed to fertilizer was 05 tha or less where it took 18 kg of rice to buy 1 kg of urea the yield gap exceeded 1 tha figure 1412 three economic components of the yield gap from barker 1979 figure 1413 relationship of the real price of fertilizer to the yield gap contributed by fertilizer from herdt 1979 571 572 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply source of credit is another institutional factor that determines the level of inputs used by the farmer farmers using institutional credit that is available in most countries at an annual interest rate of 912 have slightly higher effective fertilizer prices however any combination of high interest rate private credit or disincentive share tenure results in reduced incentives to use fertilizer herdt 1979 factors limiting increased rice production in the mid1960s and early 1970s there was optimism that technological changes and modern inputs would revolutionize rice yields of tropical asia by the mid 1970s there was increased appreciation for the environmental constraints limiting rice yields and production to determine the potential of technology it is essential to determine the potential of the crop in the farmers environments this was attempted in the constraints study just described also to be considered is the farmers ability and willingness to achieve the yield potential on their farm two contrasting ideas are suggested to explain low yields and production of rice in many tropical countries in asia agricultural scientists feel that both the farmers and the institutional system are not taking full advantage of technology social scientists believe that the technology developed in the experiment station in many instances is not appropriate for the farmers environment recent evidence from the asian development banks second asian agri cultural survey is that institutional constraints not lack of technology are the major reason for a farmers failure to realize the full potential of modern technology these constraints are slowing the rate of agricultural and economic development in asia asian development bank 1977 variability in environmental factors recent studies irri 1977 1978b 1979 suggest that environmental factors are of critical importance in explaining the gap between yield potential of the modern rices and their average farm yields this is particularly true if the definition of environment includes quality of irrigation diversity and variability of environment in different ricegrowing countries and within a countrys different ricegrowing regions would make development of appropriate technology to match particular environmental factors extremely difficult herdt and barker 1977 nevertheless attempts are underway to develop a somewhat more rigorous definition of the rice environment and include characteristics such as water depth soils rainfall and possibly temperature the issue of environmental effects on yield the yield gap i in fig 145 focuses on the differences between farmers environments and experiment station factors limiting increased rice production 573 table 148 factors perceived to limit rice production versus frequency of breeding for tolerance to

factors to rice production but few of those factors were included in the breeding objectives for example the relative frequency of drought as a perceived problem was 85 that of diseases and insects but droughts relative frequency as a breeding objective was only 7 that of pests table 148 the relative frequency of the breeders perceptions of injurious soils as a limiting factor was 60 but the relative frequency of tolerance for injurious soils as a breeding objective was 13 classification of the variability of environmental factors affecting rice production it is nearly impossible to list and classify all the factors that limit rice production however herdt and barker 1977 reported a list of environmental factors that vary across sites seasons and years table 149 among that list of factors some such as water depth can be overwhelmingly more important than all other factors with all the available information on soils climate and so on information is still grossly lacking on the

major challenge to the development of technology appropriate to specific environmental regime minimizing technical constraints the past decade heralded remarkable scientific progress in rice production modern varieties were adopted on millions of hectares by farms of all sizes large sums of money were invested in irrigation and other agricultural development projects nevertheless the green revolution bypassed millions of small rice farmers rice research emphasis shifted early in the 1970s to serve those bypassed farmers impetus for the shift came from irri which turned from a discipline oriented approach to a multidisciplinary team approach to serving the needs of rice farmers the irri genetic evaluation and utilization geu program is detailed in chapter 6 today teams of geu scientists from most of asias rice growing countries collaborate closely to identify and test genetic materials resistant to pests and environmental stresses ranging from fungal and viral diseases to devastating insects drought toxic soils and deep water the geu objective is to develop a science and technology relevant to small rice farmers 575 technology that will provide farmers in disadvantaged cropping environments with the benefits of modern rice technology enjoyed by farmers living in the more attractive environments as national research organizations have gained strength and staff capability improved irri has served more as a catalyst for international cooperation and less as a model for a national research organization instead of releasing varieties irri has greatly stepped up the supply of genetic materials for evaluation and testing in national programs early generation breeding materials f 2 are now sent in bulk directly to national cooperators without being tested at irri that arrangement assures evaluation under a range of environments and permits local scientists to select cultivars based on best performance in the local environment through the international rice testing program irtp rices from national programs are evaluated along with irri genetic materials many technical constraints to high yields that appeared nonsolvable under limited testing now appear partially solvable through internationalization of testing and use of genetic materials there is now a chance to succeed in developing an appropriate technology whereas only partial success was achieved with the modern technology that was developed under limited testing science and technology relevant to small rice farmers among those that the green revolution bypassed are farmers who depend solely on the unpredictable monsoonal rains to water their crops some grow upland rice and manage it like wheat others bund their fields to hold water on the land they puddle but the rains often fail with the modern rices often even less tolerant of dry weather than the traditional varieties drought makes it risky to spend money on the fertilizers and other chemicals needed to make modern rices pay best so the farmers continue to struggle with the same rice technology that their ancestors used and often produce barely a subsistence crop at the other extreme are millions of farmers on whose fields floodwaters annually rise to depths of 16 m floating rice growing areas marking the modern short statured rices for failure barker and pal 1979 mainly as a result of adverse environmental conditions in a substantial portion of the worlds rice landsestimates range from half to three fourthsfarmers have no improved varieties or technology available that are suited to their areas to overcome this problem three steps are suggested researchers must work closely with farmers to determine their constraints researchers must find out why farmers have not adopted the new technology or if they have adopted it why their yields are so low research managers must organize research and training programs to encourage interdisciplinary approach in solving farmers problems in the field 576 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply researchers must collaborate their research and develcpment programs with those of cooperating scientists and educators in the ricegrowing countries for theirs is the ultimate task of developing and adopting the technology needed to produce more rice for the developing world unresolved challenges and research strategies recent progress in the application of science and technology for the optimum use of available soil water air sunlight and biological resources in agriculture has raised mankinds hope for the future however considerable work remains in the development of agricultural balance sheets based on the understanding of the production assets and liabilities of each area and in developing technology to suit specific agroclimatic and management conditions whenever possible steps for increasing the area under assured irrigation should receive the highest priority to increase production of rice and other food crops chandler 1979 this is particularly critical in the tropics and subtropics where rainfall distribution is often skewed in asia there is a strong association between the proportion of the area under irrigation and average rice yield which explains why much of the rice technology now available gives the best results where there is controlled irrigation however irrigation is becoming increasingly expensive to increase rice production further greater productivity must also be achieved in rainfed areas in a world perspective the urgency for constant expansion of total production remains strong and continues to demand attention it is true that world food production as a whole and rice production in particular has expanded notably since the introduction of modern technology in the mid1960s but the need for more food to improve nutritional requirements in large regions and more urgently to ward off severe deficits in selected countries continues to dominate the international food picture this situation compared with the energy crisis and related problems poses great challenges to all rice researchers and research managers and policy makers in different countries to develop and adopt suitable technology for rice farmers energy requirements and mechanization during the past two decades agriculture in many developing countries has undergone dramatic change much of it centered in the small farmer sector most of the farms in south and southeast asia average less than 2 ha in size and in the past a substantial share of the energy to operate them has come from onfarm sources such as human labor and animal power recent breakthroughs in agriculture have stimulated introduction of modern seed and chemical inputs such as fertilizers insecticides and herbicides recently the mechanical technologies such as power pumps tractors and mechanical equipment have been introduced in some areas unresolved challenges and research strategies 577 recently kuether and duff 1979 studied the energy issues in small farm production systems table 1410 a small amount of asian rice land is still tilled completely by human power on the other hand there are a few large highly mechanized rice farms that employ the same machinery and cultural techniques that are used in the developed nations studies show that overall energy consumption increases 26 when mechanical land preparation and mechanical threshing and drying replace human and labor power fuel is the major contribution to the increase although a decrease in human and animal energy offsets some of the increase use of a four wheel tractor for primary tillage in the traditional system increases total energy requirements by only 5 and tillage energy by 20 yet shortens the time required for land tillage from 105 to 43 hours many farmers pay for the added energy input to obtain the benefits of timely land preparation and reduced labor requirements in fact mechanization of land preparation in some form mostly hand tractors and some contractual four wheel tractors is spreading gradually in the philippines and in some othercountries in south and southeast asia with the availability of the shorter duration rice varieties a distinct possibility exists for growing two crops where one grew before or three crops where two grew before therefore shortening the land preparation period by some degree of mechanization would help maximize the potential of new rice technology reduced tillage or adoption of a minimum tillage practice could also contribute to energy reduction but weed control problems increase see chapter 8 so better herbicides or more efficient cultural methods that do not require a high amount of chemical energy are required before net energy savings can be realized in tropical asia human effort contributes a relatively small portion of the total energy consumed in each production system fig 1414 never exceeding 13 of the total although 735 labor hours are required to produce that share of energy fig 1415 these studies suggest that human energy contributes a small portion of the total energy input into most traditional asian rice farming systems as food

rice in sacramento valley in california fossil energy inputs for rice production are much lower in tropical asia than in the united states because rice is grown in conditions ranging from no mechanization irrigation or fertilization to conditions as intensive as those in the united states however it is becoming increasingly clear that as higher production per unit of land is required to feed an increasing world population use of greater cropping intensity through substitution of mechanical for human and animal power higher chemical rates and increased irrigation will be neces table

production of food feed and fiber is supplemented by cultural energy which is that derived from human and animal labor fossil fuels burned by tractors harvesters and threshers and the energy used in transportation and in processing of rice a small portion of the cultural energy is conserved when the crop utilizes plant nutrients from fertilizers but most of it is ultimately dissipated into the environment as heat and not transformed into harvestable energy heichel 1973 the relative contributions of different forms of cultural energy in agricultural production have varied over time and 582 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply figure 1416 solar and cultural energy input and output cycle in plants from swaminathan 1979 geographic regions modern agriculture derives practically all of its cultural energy from fossil fuels or other energy sources that replace labor on the other hand much of the energy in the traditional agricultural system is derived from onfarm sources human labor and animal power are notable examples but as agriculture modernizes more resources are purchased outside the traditional sector the study by kuether and duff 1979 suggests that in most traditional small farm food production systems human energy represents a relatively small portion of total input energy for example rice production in the philippines is highly labor intensive but is considered the most energy efficient agricultural system as food production systems modernize energy consumption increases and the system becomes less energy efficient and increasingly more dependent on commercial forms of energy therefore development of methods and machines to more efficiently use highenergy inputs offers potential for reducing the total input energy of the food production systems for example a framework should be considered to develop evaluate and adopt improved nitrogen sources and management practices for rice unless high losses and low efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers are corrected most of the potential benefits from increased use of fertilizer nitrogen may not be realized it is critical to develop inexpensive techniques for making large urea granules for point placement in the reduced unresolved challenges and research strategies 583 layer in lowland soils such techniques should be developed for factory and villagelevel production in addition simple machines are needed to apply the urea particles beneath the surface of flooded soils and increase fertilizer efficiency from the current level of 3035 to 6065 it is imperative to develop integrated systems of nitrogen management which utilize compost and crop residues biological nitrogen fixation and improved fertilizer practices for rice finally varieties and cultural practices should be sought that will be less dependent on chemical energy in the forms of pesticides and fertilizers and still able to produce high and stable yields developing rainfed rice technology much of todays modern rice technology performs well where there is controlled irrigation to increase rice production greater productivity must be achieved in rainfed areas constraints on high yields in rainfed farms are innumerable description of environment a better description is needed of the various environmental regimes it is important to know the condition in which farmers grow rice and then test the technology under those environments planning of research and international testing must include newer strategies in developing new rice technology appropriate in diverse environmental conditions in other words the goals of developing new varieties should be in terms of environments instead of in terms of plant characteristics a better description is needed of the various environ ments and also of the institutional structures of research as they relate to those environments tailoring new varieties varieties need to be tailored not only for the physical environment but also for cropping systems and financial resources of farmers increased cropping intensity has been a major source of increased rice production since the introduction of the earlymaturing modern rices these earlymaturing rices may offer greater profits by increasing cropping intensity and productivity per hectare per day than by attempting to increase yield per hectare of a single crop of rice however technology for increased cropping intensity should cater to financial resources of small farmers options for increasing rice supplies the most important options for increasing world rice supplies are through an expansion in the area grown to rice an increase in the productivity of existing rice lands table 1413 total land area and arable land by continents in millions of hectares adapted from

and research strategies 585 east asian countries where the land constraint was encountered in the early part of the century have long been exploiting the potential for better farm productivity through irrigation development and the application of science based technologies however by the early 1960s there was little land available in the rest of asia where intensive rice farming could be developed at reasonable cost needed production increases could be maintained only through the diffusion of yield increasing technology and an increase in cropping intensity compared to the rest of the world asia has little new land to bring into cultivation table 1413 some expansion in land is possible in the outer islands of indonesia some parts of malaysia burma thailand and the philippines however the new cultivated lands in asia are generally remote and often are not farmed because of their low productivity thus to develop these lands in generaland for rice in particularrequires considerable investment in re search capital infrastructure and human energy in essence the possibilities for increasing the area under rice in asia are limited thus a substantial part of the required increase in production must come from higher yields per crop on existing rice lands and from increasing cropping intensity on both irrigated and nonirrigated rice lands even then if supplies of rice are to keep pace with projected demand there must be an increase in investments for rice research and production tech nologies must be designed and pricing policies set to make it attractive for the farmer to adopt on a continuing basis the production increasing technology flinn and gascon 1980 lrrigation development analyses by the asian development bank 1977 fao 1978 and the trilateral commission colombo et al 1977 have indicated that irrigation is a critical component of the infrastructure for agricultural development in rice growing areas of asia irrigation enables higher yields per hectare table 1414 and table 1414 example of rice yields in the monsoonal season for irrigated and upland rice adapted from palacpac 1979 rice yield tha country irrigated upland bangladesh 19 12 indonesia 30 13

facilitates the production of modern varieties of rice and makes it profitable for farmers to use a higher level of associated inputs such as fertilizers and increase number of rice cropping thus it is widely considered that good water management is the single most important factor necessary for sustained increase in rice production in asia the opportunities for increasing the productivity of rice in an irrigated environment are predicted to be higher than in alternative rice growing environments hsieh et al 1980 there appears to be a close relationship between irrigation rate and mean national average yield of a given country fig 1417 irrigation rate total irrigated rice area harvested total rice area harvested by using this concept the countries in asia can be divided into three groups the first group contains only japan with an irrigation rate of 98 and rice yields of figure 1417 relationship between irrigation rate and national average yield in rice growing countries in asia adapted from colombo et al 1977 note 1979 estimate for rice yields for republic of korea is 62 tha and for taiwan 45 tha unresolved challenges and research strategies 587 about 6 tha the second group includes the republic of korea and taiwan with irrigation rates of about 80 and average yields of about 4 tha the third group includes the remaining 13 countries with a mean irrigation rate of 35 and yields of about 2 tha in 19741976 colombo et al 1977 however current statistics show that the republic of korea has increased its irrigation rate further 86 in 1978 and with increased rate of inputsparticularly chemical fertilizers the national average for 1979 was 62 tha see chapter 6 on the other hand the peoples republic of china with almost the entire rice growing area grown to irrigated rice had a 35 tha national average in 19761978 this indicates that complete water control with irrigation and drainage is a major factor but not the only factor in increasing national average yield of rice in a given country nevertheless the overriding benefits of improvement of existing irrigation facilities are not only increased yield per hectare of a given crop but also increased cropping intensity and hence productivity and stability of rice and other crop production in the rural areas however because of a high irrigation cost of 3000 or more per hectare the increase in irrigated area will be slow in many countries in south and southeast asia research priorities research priorities for rice should focus on potential benefits and costs of alternative methods of increasing rice production by minimizing or eliminating constraints barker et al 1975 in 1977 an attempt was made to develop plans for appropriate research based on potential benefits estimates were made on the probable sources of increased rice production in major rice growing systems in asia table 1415 a team of scientists with diverse disciplines serving on irris long range planning committee concluded that about 55 of the future food production in asia would come from increased yields and 45 from increased cropping intensity irri 1978a irrigated areas in south and southeast asia will likely provide about 46 of the increased production and rainfed lowland and deepwater areas about 34 while the anticipated increased production from upland and deepwater areas is much less the fact that these production areas have largely been ignored in the past justifies increased research attention a large and perhaps the poorest sector of population depends on their basic food need from the upland deepwater and floating rice growing areas global interest in upland rice which is the major system of rice culture in west africa and latin america dictates continuing if not increased attention to research on that crop thus in reevaluating research priorities relative emphasis and consideration must be given not only to potential production increases but also to the welfare need of the farmers the landless laborers and the rice consumers boyce and evenson 1975 compiled international data on investment in research and extension directed toward the improvement of agricultural crops 588 modern rice technology constraints and world food supply table 1415 rice production benefits expected from research under different environmental complexes as estimated by an

expectations created by the rice varieties developed by irri and other national programs have been only partially met using a statistical model they estimated the production increase associated with high yielding varieties their results suggest that the first generation investment on research yielded extraordinarily high income streams which could not be maintained in the second generation investment on research the authors finally concluded that investment policy on research has been far from optimal particularly in the low income countries according to wortman and cummings 1978 payoff from investment in agricultural research can be very high if research is organized to achieve ambitious development goals research should be an important catalyst of rapid agricultural development past results clearly demonstrate that the opportunities for technology payoff from research still remain high in irrigated ricegrowing areas furthermore considerable research is needed to maintain the high yield levels already achieved under irrigation nevertheless rainfed lowland deepwater and upland areas must receive higher priorities than have been given them in the past recently herdt and barker 1977 suggested a system of technology development processes that should be considered by scientists and institutions involved in rice research figure 1418 shows four types of research activity between basic biological research and farm production type i research which deals with development of new technologies that might raise production potentials can take place in a narrow range of environments such as in experiment station fields laboratories greenhouses or phytotrons because rice production takes place under a wide range of environmental conditions represented by the vertical axis of fig 1418 the intermediate steps of references 589 figure 1418 the relationship between components of an agricultural research system and the degree of environmental diversity in which each component should be operated from herdt and barker 1977 developing testing and applying new technologies should take place across a wide range of environments naturally there would be some overlapping of these activities because there is a continuum from basic biological research to farm production to increase rice production 35 per year which is assumed as the need to equal population growth considerable efforts and commitments are needed to examine old strategies of rice research and to develop new ones however research and technology development alone may not be adequate to increase rice production in the coming decade government policy to provide farmers with incentive for adopting yield increasing technology and with infrastructure including increased irrigation facilities are seemingly the most crucial factors in the use of technology by small farmers in asia references asian development bank 1977 asian agricultural survey 1976 manila philippines 490 pp in africa london aw
