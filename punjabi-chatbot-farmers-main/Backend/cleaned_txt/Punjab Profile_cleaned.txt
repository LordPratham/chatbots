punjab holds place of pride among the indian states for its outstanding achievements in agricultural development the state has witnessed t remendous increase in the agricultural production during the green revolution period main ly due to healthy mix of institutional and technological factors agrarian economy consolidat ion of landholdings reclamation of new agricultural lands development of irrigation use of biochemical inputs comprising high yielding variety seeds chemical fertilizers insecticides a nd mechanical inputs were among the important factors which helped punjab agriculture in making r apid strides dominating rural based political power with agricultural background provided favorab le environment through thrust on rural and agricultural development in this context extensi on of irrigation network rural link roads rural electrification establishment of focal points and agricultural market centers efficient delivery system of credit and other agricultural inputs alon g with effective implementation of agricultural price policy for wheat and paddy played significant role in agriculture and rural development of state consequently the punjab state comprising on ly 154 per cent of the total geographical area of country now contributes 1314 per cent towards t he total food grain production of the country state has earned a name of granary of india through contributing 3540 per cent of rice and 40 to 75 per cent of wheat to the central pool in the pas t two decades green revolution sustained till the eighties after which the agricultural production in the state showed the signs of stagnation in nineties the exalting cost of cultivation of major crops further aggravated the situation through squeezing the profitability of agriculture adversely affecting the socioeconomic condition of farmers i n the state thus the agriculture in state has reached a plateau making it very hard to make furth er progress under available technologies and natural resource base its relative contribution in central pool of food grains both for wheat and paddy has also been declining during last few years though still being the largest contributor of wheat and second largest of paddy after andhra prad esh to central pool of the country the emerging scene of punjab agriculture is not fre e from some serious concerns the state cropping pattern dominated by wheatrice rota tion is causing a serious damage to the states 2 natural resource base paddy in particular a water intensive crop is blamed for watertable depletion in tubewell irrigated areas and waterlo gging in canal irrigated areas increasing incidence of nutrient deficiency in the soils incl uding micronutrients and insectpest attacks on the crops are also posing major threats to producti vity food grain production and sustainability of agriculture in the long run diversification of cropping pattern towards environment friendly high value crops with emphasis on quality output an d promotion of agroprocessing industry is the need of hour the present study has been an attempt to update the information of the agricultural sector in punjab state for this available recent secondar y data have been taken from various sources and interpreted 12 population total population of punjab as per 2011 census is 27 704236 of which male and female are 14634819 and 13069417

of new technology punjab agriculture m ade rapid progress since mid sixties this progress has been made possible by speedy adop tion of improved seeds irrigation and increased use of nonconventional inputs like ferti lizers machinery and pesticides supported by the natural resource base of state the progress wa s spectacular in early phase due to rising agricultural productivity and expansion in gross cr opped area however of late the progress in agricultural production has slowed down and signs o f stagnation are visible the changes in agrarian structure and agricultural growth performa nce

the information on distribution of operational hold ings in state of punjab at two points of time viz 200506 and 201011 is depicted in table 21 the figure shows that the total operational holdings in state during the last five years period increased by 55 thousands from 1003 lakh to 1058 lakh point worth noting is the marginalizati on of holdings with proportionate increase in marginal and small farmers the proportion of margi nal and small holdings which was 1336 and 1825 per cent in 200506 increased to 1550 and 18 53 per cent respectively on the other hand the proportion of holdings in all other categories viz semimedium medium and large had been declined during this period over this period the a verage holding size in state also went down from 395 ha to 378 ha 13 table 21 distribution

of total 212 cropping pattern the green revolution brought significant changes in the cropping pattern of punjab the cropping pattern in punjab state at selected points over time is given in table 22 the table show that in 197071 about 4049 per cent of the g ross cropped area gca was under wheat which increased to 4431 per cent in 200708 and si nce then hovered around 4450 per cent rice which occupied around 687 per cent of the gr oss cropped area in 197071 increased to over 3315 per cent in 200708 and then rose furth er to around 3585 per cent in 201011 the increase in wheat cultivation has been at the cost of gram rapeseed and mustard while that of rice has been obtained by shifting the area from ma ize groundnut millets and cotton the proportionate area under cotton in 197071 was 7 pe r cent of gross cropped area and increased to 934 per cent in 199091 after mid 1990s the area under cotton has been adversely affected due to inclement weather and pest attack its share in gca went down to 597 per cent in 200001 with introduction of bt varieties area under cotton started increasing and rose to 769 per cent in 200708 in 201011 it accounted for 613 per cent of the gca in state areas under sugarcane and potato have not remained stable respective sha re of pulses and oilseeds in gca has recorded a sharp decline from 729 and 520 per cen t in 197071 to 025 and 071 per cent in 201011 it can be concluded that imbalance in favo ur of two main cereals viz rice and wheat in the cropping pattern has further sharpened despite all efforts on diversification of state 14 agriculture this happened because of better relati ve profitability of these crops with minimum production and marketing risk as compared to other crops table 22 shift in cropping pattern in punjab 197 071 to

the farmers of state tended their crops according to the advice of exper ts through well established agricultural extension network and achieved the record productiv ity levels major drivers of state agricultural growth are provided in table 27 the irrigated are a which was merely 71 per cent to the net area sown in 197071 has reached to a level of abo ut 98 percent by the year 201011 the number of tube wells has gone up from 192 lakh in 197071 to 1382 lakh in 201011 the proportion of area under hyvs to gross cropped area has increased tremendously hundred per cent of the area of wheat and rice is under hyvs an d that of maize is nearly 98 per cent the adoption of hyvs in punjab raised the consumption o f chemical fertilizers and plant protection materials tremendously in the state the per hectar e consumption of chemical fertilizers npk which was merely 3750 kg in 197071 has achieved t he levels of 246 kg in 201112 total consumption of chemical fertilizers nutrient in s tate which

in 2011 12 the rapid adoption of the green revolution tech nology in punjab has led to the sharp increase in farm mechanization the number of tractors in st ate was only 5281 in 197071 which increased to more than 5 lakh in 201011 the punja b state is one of the leading states for number of tractors tillers in terms of density per 1000 hectare of net sown area development of irrigation infrastructure along with large scale me chanization of state agriculture helped in increasing the gross copped area from 5678 thousand ha in 197071 to 7872 thousand ha in 201011 consequently over this period the intensi ty of cropping jumped from 140 per cent to 190 per cent effective price policy through signif icant increase in minimum support prices msp assured procurement and development of marke t infrastructure particularly for wheat and paddy coupled with relatively better production tec hnology available has driven the state agriculture at remarkable rate and resulted into th e emergence of paddy and wheat crops as the most secure and profitable ones in the state thus rapid dissemination and adoption of new techn ologies and modern inputs viz hyvs fertilizers and pesticides irrigation agric ultural credit development of necessary 21 infrastructure and setting up of institutional mech anisms for the supply of agricultural inputs and procurement of agricultural produce created an enab ling environment for enhancing agricultural production in state 24 marketing and warehouse facilities besides advancement in farm technology agricultural development also depends upon the improvement in market infrastructure through ensuri ng better returns to farmers under agricultural produce markets act 1961 the market c harges in punjab have been regularized and transactions are conducted by open auction in the r egulated markets under this act at market level there is a market committee represented by fa rmers traders labourers and officials of agriculture and cooperative departments the weight s and measurement act provides for standardization of weights and measures used in the markets punjab mandi board the coordinating body for marke t committees played the lead role in developing the village approach roads and market ya rds on priority to facilitate the efficient marketing of farm produce and agricultural input de livery system in state indicators of marketing infrastructure presented in table 28 rev ealed that the number of regulated market in punjab has increased from 88 in 197071 to 146 in t he year 201011 likewise the number of subyards attached with these regulated market has increased from 154 to 294 during the same period over this period the geographical area and average number of villages served per regulated market in punjab decreased from 573 to 34 5 sq km and from 139 to 84 respectively with large scale state procurement of food grains w hich takes time to be dispatched to the deficit states state owned storage capacity re mained a major issue in the recent years many steps has been taken in this regard and total state owned storage capacity increased from 17639 lakh tons in 20072008 to 22633 lakh tones in 2010 11 table 29 the punjab mandi board provided all weather metalle d roads to all the villages so that the farmers could sell their output throughout the year it is very encouraging that hundred per cent

dependent on the availability of adequate local supplies particularly from the punja b state the government of india wanted to maintain the tempo of production of food grains pro duction thus it provides production incentive oriented procurement prices to the farmers as a re sult of the assured market at remunerative prices coupled with market infrastructure and avail able production technology the punjab farmers has pushed up the paddy and wheat productio n remarkably thus punjab farmers has responded to the countrys demand for wheat and pad dy and now near about 80 per cent of the gross cropped area in state is under these two crop s table 210 indicates that market arrivals for paddy and wheat in state during year 201011 were a t 13136 and 10278 lakh tones respectively due

from increasing popu lation of country the main emphasis in punjab state remained on increasing the food production with little attention on managing its natural resource base there has been continuous increase in the net sown area in the state and currently the proportion of net sown area to total geographical area is the highest in the country punjab state has recorded remarkable g rowth in agriculture sector as more than 97 per cent of the cultivated area is under assured ir rigation which is the major reason for higher productivity and input use in agriculture the inte nsive agriculture particularly monoculture of wheat and paddy is now imposing intense pressure on the available natural resources which requires new vision and holistic approach for their management now there is need to promote the optimum management of soil and water resources so as to conserve these and improve the productivity the government policies availability of resources appropriate

chapter 31 land use the punjab state lies between the 29 o33323n latitude and 7353 7655e longitude and is bounded on the west by pakistan on the nor th by jammu and kashmir on the north east by himachal pradesh and on the south by haryana and rajasthan the land use classification of state for years 200708 to 201011 is presented in table 31 the total geographical area of the state is 5036 lakh ha during 201011 the net sow n area was at 4158 lakh ha which indicated that about 83 per cent of the area in state is alre ady under cultivation this is the highest in country and the state is virtually comparable to a farmstead where most of the area is under the cultivation leaving little land for other activitie s further there is virtually no land left for bringing under cultivation and due to recent spurt in urbanization the net sown area declined from 4187 lakh ha in 200708 to 4158 lakh ha in 2 01011 however during this period the increase in cropping intensity from 1879 per cent to 190 per cent led to increase in gross cropped area in state from 7870 lakh ha to 7882 l akh ha the forest wealth of state is very poor with only 584 per cent of the total area under the forest cover the area under permanent barren 29 and unculturable land has been almost found to be s table at 047 per cent of the state area for last many years the state has been virtually reached th e saturation point in the matter of addition to the physical area horizontally the vertical expans ion of area has become increasingly limited due to already achieved higher levels of cropping inten

or clearin g of sand dunes and crop management practices and by bringing more areas under irrigate d agriculture the problem of water logging is particularly acute in southwestern districts fero zepur fazilika muktsar and faridkot of the state occupying lower topographic positions introd uction of salt resistant crops and good drainage system may overcome this problem to some e xtent as per expert views the high nutritional requireme nt of paddy and wheat has exhausted the punjab soils of vital nutrients thus higher a nd higher doses of major nutrients especially nitrogen have to be applied for sustaining adequat e production levels low fertility status obviously implies that the amount of plant nutrient that the soil itself is capable of making available to the growing crop is far less than that needed for getting high yields the most of state soils test low to medium in available nitroge n and available phosphorus the soils in general are medium to high in available potassium micronutrient deficiencies in large areas have also been noticed adversely affecting crop yie ld the soils contain sufficient calcium and magnesium however their deficiencies can be obser ved in local pockets supporting sodic soils recently sulphur deficiency has been recorded in so me soils especially in coarsetextured soils receiving highanalysis fertilizers in recent year s widespread deficiency of one or more micro nutrients has been observed resulting in significa nt decrease in crop yield especially of high yielding varieties deficiency of zinc is of widesp read occurrence particularly in the central and southwestern districts deficiencies of iron and m anganese have been observed in coarse textured soils recently brought under ricewheat cr opping system thus it is more important to preserve existing cul tivated areas in state from degradation due to water logging soil salinity and sodicity b esides soil erosion due to intensive cropping and its attended manifestations repeated paddy cultiva tion in the long run will make the soils fine textured impervious and unfit for cultivation cor rective measures through intensive r d have to be undertaken to conserve soil resources s peedy soiltesting facilities followed by appropriate advice about fertilizers use can effec tively help save the soils from exhaustion 32 33 cropping intensity cropping intensity is a measure of the

with introduct ion of new agricultural technology in sixties crop rotations experienced significant changes alon g with the increase in cropping intensity which resulted in increased aggregate labour employment i n agriculture however due to fast pace of agriculture mechanization during eighties the comp lementary relationship between the agricultural development mechanization and demand for labour we akened during nineties the punjab 48 agriculture reached a stage where increased mechani zation particularly for harvesting of wheat and paddy and use of labour substituting inputs like we edicides and herbicides along with decrease in area under labour intensive crops started competin g with labour force and resulted in substantial labour displacement the recent stagnation in prod uctivity of major crops along with imperceptible movement of labour out of agriculture sector raised concern about its potential to increase the income and labour productivity there is clear evidence that overtime the capacity of agriculture sector to absorb labour has been declin ing significantly the employment elasticity with respect to aggregate output come down from 05 4 during 1970s to 036 during 1980s and presently even less than 020 sidhu 2002 in add ition the experience of the last decade brings out that the growth in agricultural sector has bee n generating more casualization of employment there is increase in casualization of labour as ove rtime the proportions of family labour and permanent hired labour is declining deshapande et al 2007 the slow growth of agriculture employment in recent years could be largely attributed to imbalanced growth of mechanization that substitutes the machine labour for human and animal labour the level of mechanization is already highe r in punjab where man days employed in production of crops are low as compared to other pa rts of the country and negative growth in agricultural employment was experienced against a p ositive growth rate of real agricultural output in the nineties haque and sharma 2004 in a labour surplus economy like ours the primary concern still centers on human labour emplo yment as the siphoning off mechanism of agricultural labour to other sectors has remained r ather ineffective in punjab state the solution to problems of rural unemployment and under employment depends upon the potential of

productivity of both of these crops are the main movers for this in crease in production of these crops in the state except potato all other crops showed either decrea se in area during this period the area under cotton the third most important cr op of state went down drastically during the 9 th plan reason being the uncontrollable pest problem s in late nineties however with introduction of bt cotton its yield and production picked up remarkably during the 10 th plan despite the area under maize crop went down by 268 4 per cent over the study period due to tremendous increase 4863 in its productivity i ts production in state increased by 894 per cent it clearly reveals that the paddy and wheat c rop rotation became predominant at the cost of 55 maize other cereals oilseed and pulses in the sta te a cursory glance on the table revealed that during the study period the productivity of these crops went up significantly with the exception of sugarcane compound annual growth rates cagr for major crops of state in 8 th to 11 th five year plans and for overall study period are presented in table 52 the figures revealed that rice area production and productivity over the period of abou t two decades increased significantly at the cagr of 156 279 and 120 per cent respectively thus over the study period the increase in area under rice contributed relatively more towards production increase as compared to the contribution of yield increase during this period planwise while the significant increase in area and yield was observed during 11 th plan and 10 th plan respectively production of rice increased significantly during 9th and 10 th plan periods the production of wheat during the s tudy period increased at cagr of 116 per cent while area under it and yield increased at cagr of 047 and 069 per cent respectively thus major contributor towards wheat production over this period was the increase in yield planwise major increase in wheat area production and yield was observed during 9 th plan with the exception of potato cagr of area of all other major crops in state viz cotton maize pulses oilseeds and suga rcane during this period were found to be

68 chapter 8 post harvest management and value addition developing countries have long promoted post harves t management and value added processing of agricultural output as a path of indu strialization with increase in per capita income and urbanization leading to increase in dema nd for high quality processed and packaged foods the process of value adding to agricultural p roduction and fostering of farm nonfarm linkages starts gathering momentum which in turn ge nerates higher income and employment for the farm families besides making agriculture a mor e effective contributor to industrial growth sarkar 1997 agro based industry refers to the s ubset of manufacturing that processes raw materials obtained from agriculture and its allied sectors such as animal husbandry forestry and logging and intermediate products derived from othe r industries such as semi processed hides and skins for manufacturing leather and leather pro ducts and edible oils for manufacturing hydrogenated oil the value adding processes ranges from simple preservation like drying grading and storage of output to production of high value products such as manufacturing of textiles paper rubber etc through modern capita l intensive methods chadha and sahu 2003 punjab despite being the leading producer of food grains is way behind in value addition industry to agricultural output the state governme nt has taken many steps to diversify the punjab agriculture toward the production of high va lue crops however the high value crops like fruits and vegetables are highly perishable in natu re and the farmers have to decide immediately at the time of harvest to dispose of the produce d ue to lack of adequate facilities for post harvest handling of high value crops like grading and packi ng houses cold storages etc diversification initiates in state met with limited success the pr ocessing plants established in the area procure the produce from a few contract farmers only and th e majority has to depend upon the markets where the prices are highly volatile in nature when ever there is glut in the market and a slight delay in disposal may lead to serious post harvest losses to the produce both quantitative and qualitative losses of extremely variable magnitude occur at all stages in the post harvest system from harvesting through handling storage process ing and marketing to final delivery to the consumer the principal causes of these losses are physiological deterioration due to high temperature low atmospheric humidity and damage du e to physical injury diseases and pests post harvest losses range between 1535 per cent f or different types of agricultural 69 produce it is obvious that any reduction in post h arvest losses will contribute to the net availability of food in the economy which is of im measurable worth and will help to increase the producers returns and consumers price grover and kumar 2011 with the scale of production the most prominent food grain processing activity in state is the milling of paddy rice milling is a primary processing activity under which the paddy grain is converted into polished rice rice forms t he basic primary processed product obtained from paddy along with various secondary and tertiar y products like husk and bran oil till nineties the major portion of the paddy was milled through hullers usually with low milling capacity and no control on the polishing of rice b ran and a higher breakage of rice occurs to overcome all these rice mills have been establishe d and became more popular as substitute
