brought to kansas by mennonites in 1874 quickly became the most important crop in the state continued improvements bybreeding and modern technology for production havekept kansas the number one wheat state in the nationhard red winter wheat has stayed important for so longbecause its traits and pattern of growth and developmentare best suited of all crops to the weather soils and otherconditions in the state however weather in kansas isless than ideal for wheat and more than any other factorlimits grain yields in the state wheat growers in kansasare highly knowledgeable and the soils are generallyexcellent but grain yields are only a fraction of the 100plus bushels per acre averages in some countries theweather also limits the production inputs the seedingrate fertilizer and pesticides that can be usedeconomically for high kansas wheat yields what are the plant traits that enabled turkey wheat and its successors our present varieties to become soimportant in kansas no single trait has been identifiedand a combination of many different characteristicsseems to be involved winter wheat is a coolseason cropand grows best under moderate temperatures but it isable to resist both cold and hot weather this hardiness isessential for wheat to endure the freezing temperatures ofwinter the late frosts of spring the high temperatures ofjune and the droughts that can occur anytime becauseof its winter growth habit wheat is planted during fallbecomes well established before winter and greens upand starts growing quickly when conditions are favorablein spring winter wheat not only resists freezingtemperatures during winter it needs the cold to joint andflower so it can set grain in spring flowering alsorequires the lengthening days of spring so it doesntoccur until may when the dangers of late frosts areusually past the root system of winter wheat extendsfarther than that of any other wheat class enabling theplant to obtain moisture from deep in the soil profile intimes of drought these growth and development traitsmake wheat highly adaptable to kansas conditions the planting date is only one of the many management practices that are determined by the growthand development patterns of wheat the seeding rate forinstance sets the number of plants per acre and alongwith tillers per plant kernels per tiller and weight perkernel determines the yield of grain a change to any ofthese yield components such as a reduction in thetillering capacity would change the seeding rate that isneeded for maximum production by knowing how a wheat plant grows and develops an understanding of why it responds as it does tomanagement and the environment can be gained thispublication tells how the wheat plant grows anddevelops it also discusses some of the critical factors inits development at different stages of growth growth stages from germination through maturation the growth and development of winter wheat are divided into stages germination leads to seedlings the first stage of plant growth followed by tilleringoverwintering jointing boot heading and floweringmaturation or development of the grain is divided intomilk soft dough hard dough and physiological maturitythe stage when kernel weight is maximum ripening thelast stage occurs as the grain loses moisture until it isready to harvest germination and seedling emergence quality seed is essential for establishing a productive stand seed should have at least 85 percent germinationand 56 pounds per bushel test weight and should not beshriveled large seeds have little if any advantage overnormal plump seeds when both are planted at equalvolume or weight a wheat seed begins germination by absorbing water and oxygen adequate soil moisture and temperature areneeded for this to occur two parts of the wheat seed are ofgreatest importance in germination the embryo orgerm gives rise to the radicle or the seedling root andthe scutellum or the first leaf the other important part ofthe seed is the endosperm which contains food in the formof starch and protein for germination and emergence the coleoptile or second leaf penetrates the soil and results in emergence of the seedling usually within 5 to 7days after planting if the seed is planted too deeplybeyond the elongation distance of the coleoptile seedlingscannot emerge and a poor stand will occur semidwarfwheat varieties form short coleoptiles as well as shortplants and planting depth is particularly critical for them a firm seedbed assures good contact between the seed and the soil inadequate soil moisture is probablythe major reason for planting seed deeply if the soilmoisture runs out before the seedlings emerge as canhappen after light rains survival of the seedlings oftendepends more on the stage of germination than the lengthof the dry period seedlings from seeds that havegerminated for only one or two days can survivedesiccation and resume growth when moisture reoccursbut seedlings that are 4 or 5 days old probably will nottolerate dryinggrowth and development3the first roots on the wheat seedling are known as primary or seminal roots and include the radicle previously mentioned primary roots are usuallytemporary in wheat unless the other roots fail to developbecause of poor conditions only the main stem of awheat plant has primary roots which may be retainedthroughout the life of the plant most of the root systemthroughout the life of a wheat plant consists of secondaryor crown roots that arise from underground nodes afterthe seedling emerges many of the roots on the main stemand all the roots on the tillers are secondary roots thefunctions of roots are to anchor the plant and absorbwater and mineral nutrients most of the roots are in theplow layer or top 6 inches of soil but some penetrate asfar as 7 feet into the soil water and minerals actually areabsorbed through fine hairs on the roots surfacesextensive distribution of roots through the soil and thelarge surface area of the root hairs make the wheat plantefficient and droughtresistant the growing point and seedling growth all aboveground growth on a wheat plant comes from a meristem termed the growing point the growingpoint contains the stem partsnodes and internodesandthe wheat head in miniature it is protected by itsunderground location until spring when itdifferentiates and the plant begins to joint andeventually heads the third seedling leaf is the first foliage leaf it and the other foliage leaves as many as five to seven inspring wheat and 11 to 15 in winter wheat are the siteof photosynthesis photosynthesis is the process in whichsmall bodies called chloroplasts in cells of wheat leavesproduce food and energy from sunlight water andcarbon dioxide all the foliage and grain produced by thewheat plant comes from photosynthesis tillers are shoots that develop from nodal buds on older wheat shoots the number of tillers is determined bythe seeding rate soil moisture and fertility temperatureand variety a winter wheat plant grown under usualconditions will have three to six tillers tillers developsoon after the seedling emerges from the soil and have allthe other growth stages of the main stem tillering can be encouraged by planting early fertilizing with nitrogen and where possible irrigating ifsoil moisture is low late planting is particularlydisadvantageous because it reduces tillering and must becompensated by higher seeding rates tillers are formedonly during the fall but make most of their growth in thefollowing spring overwintering decreasing daylength and gradually falling temperatures during fall prompt the wheat plant todevelop a high level of cold hardiness most varietiesalso undergo a change from an upright to a prostrategrowth form hardiness usually is greatest during earlywinter and is lost gradually as the season progressesmost winterkilling occurs during late winter when warmspells cause the plants to loose hardiness and then arefollowed by cold fronts that cause the damage snowprovides excellent protection because it insulates theplants from extreme cold and keeps them fromresponding to warm spells the critical plant part is thegrowing point which is protected partially by beingabout 1 inch below the soil surface during winter theentire plant is killed by injury to the growing pointwhich turns from a white turgid appearance to a brownwilted appearance after it is frozen leaves often staygreen during mild winters but freezing or burning ofleaves by cold has little effect on yield tillering warming temperatures in late winter cause wheat to green up and resume growth tillers that were initiatedin the previous fall grow rapidly and change back fromthe prostrate form to an upright form as the sheaths theparts of the leaves that cover the stems become longernitrogen fertilizer should be topdressed at this time tostimulate growth of the tillers which will produce mostof the grain at harvest the growing points are still attheir protected underground position at this stage butdrought and other stresses may restrict growth of thetillers herbicides such as 24d stop development of thetillers and should not be applied at this stage jointing and boot jointing the development of nodes and internodes that form the stem of the wheat plant begins whengrowth of the tillers is complete this phase marks thechange from vegetative growth to reproductive growthand is important for several reasons growth of theinternodes pushes the growing point above the soil andgrazing must be halted so that it is not removed bylivestock the elevated position of the growing pointalong with the gradual loss of winterhardiness also makesthe plants increasingly susceptible to late frosts thegrowing point is the most susceptible of all plant parts tofrost at this stage new tillers might replace tillers inwhich the growing point has been damaged by frost butthe yield usually is reduced substantially the changefrom vegetative to reproductive growth also is when themaximum number of kernels that will be formed in thehead spike is determined causing the yield at harvest tobe susceptible to stress at this stage jointing does not occur until the plants have been exposed to winter temperatures and begin spring growthexposure to low winter temperatures is necessary toinduce jointing in winter wheat without it

leaf sheath at the top of the plant heading and flowering at the heading stage the spike emerges from the boot within 1 to 7 days after heading the flowering stage andpollination occur and the grain begins filling most plantsincluding wheat have very specific daylengthrequirements for flowering wheat is classified as a longday plant because it will flower only when days are longand nights the important times are short flowering usually begins in the center of the spike and progresses toward the ends and occurs 1 or 2 daysearlier on the main stem than on the tillers appearanceof the yellow anthers outside of the florets marks thecompletion of flowering the actual number of kernelsthat will form in the spike is determined at this stagewheat is highly selfpollinated and quite resistant to moststresses except frost during flowering temperatures onlyslightly below freezing quickly kill the male flower partssterilizing the florets so no grain is formed howeveronly part of the spike might be sterilized because of thevariation in flowering so grain might form on the centeror ends but not on the other parts maturation and ripening the grain begins growing immediately after flowering and reaches its maximum size not weightwithin about 2 weeks the maximum weight occursabout 4 weeks after flowering in kansas this period isdetermined largely by temperature and can extend up to12 weeks in areas where the weather is cool grain development stages are determined by the hardness or consistency of the endosperm of the newkernel at the first stage the endosperm has the color andconsistency of milk as the kernel fills the endospermthickens into a soft dough stage and finally a hard doughstage the doughy property of kansas winter wheat canbe observed easily by chewing the kernel physiologicalmaturity occurs when the kernel has accumulated itshighest content of dry matter has hardened and changedcolor the kernel contains 30 to 35 percent water atphysiological maturity protein and starch are the most important constituents of the wheat kernel most of the proteincomes from nitrogen previously accumulated in theleaves and most of the starch is from sugars made byphotosynthesis during the grainfilling period thenitrogen moves into the filling kernels to form proteinduring early grain development this is why if yields arelow because the kernels do not fill properly the grain ishigh in protein drought and high temperatures areusually responsible for this condition if the grain fillsnormally and yields and test weights are high grainprotein is frequently lower because it is diluted by othermaterials of course under good growing conditionsgrain protein can be increased with nitrogen fertilizer most of the leaves senesce or die soon after flowering but the flag leaf glumes and awns remainactive during most of the grainfilling periodphotosynthesis in the awns or beard provides 10 to 20percent of the grain weight this is why nearly all thewheat varieties grown in kansas have awns in coolerareas with higher rainfall wheat leaves remain activelonger and awns are less important the final yield component kernel weight is determined during maturation yields are high whenfavorable filling conditions mild temperatures andactive leaves promote growth of large plump kernelshigh temperatures especially when accompanied bywinds and foliar diseases such as leaf rust causeshriveled kernels low test weights and low yields ripening includes the changes that occur after the grain reaches physiological maturity the most importantchange is the loss of moisture from 30 to 35 percent inmature grain to 12 to 13 percent in combineripe grain grain must be harvested promptly after ripening to save the yield hail lodging and preharvest sproutingare everpresent threats to ripe grain growth stages and management nitrogen fertilizer pesticides and irrigation must be applied to wheat at certain times to have the most effectproper timing for most operations is determined by thegrowth stage not by the calendar date because growth atany given date can vary from one year to the next it isimportant to be able to recognize the different growthstages of wheat two systems the feekes and the zadoks scales are used for growth stages of wheat the feekes scale goesfrom 1 for the first seedling leaf through 114 for matureplants with hard grain the zadoks scale starts with 01for seed germination and goes to 92 for hard grain and 99for loss of dormancy by this grain the wheat productioncalendar on pages 4 and 5 gives the feekes scale forwheat growth stages the dates when they usually occurin kansas and important management operations thatshould be done at each stage when wheat does not grow a wheat plant is exposed to many hazards during its lifetime low temperatures high temperatures droughthail and wind will be mentioned here damage fromthese occurs in adverse environments such as kansaslosses can be decreased by developing more adaptablevarieties and using proper management but can never beeliminated entirely7low temperatures injure wheat by winterkilling by early spring freezes that kill the growing point and by late spring freezes that cause sterility of the headswinterkilling can be caused by direct freezing ice sheetsand desiccation hardier wheat varieties and possiblymilder winters have made winterkilling less of a problemthan it used to be improved management also hashelped timely seeding good seedbed preparation andcareful fall pasturing to leave plants vigorous and capableof holding snow during low temperatures are goodmanagement practices spring freezes seem to havebecome important in recent years newer wheat varietiesthat mature earlier initiate spring growth earlier whenspring growth starts winter wheat rapidly loses hardinessand is damaged easily by low temperatures hightemperature damage is most apparent during grain filling when the kernels are shriveled andprematurely ripe it also can occur during fall and causepoor tillering and hardening during winter hightemperatures can stimulate wheat to grow so that it willbe injured by subsequent low temperatures earlymaturing varieties have decreased hightemperaturelosses because hightemperature stress and moisturestress usually occur together irrigation and moistureconserving practices can decrease losses the wheat plant combines drought escape and drought resistance to overcome moisture stress most of its growthoccurs during fall and early spring which are periods ofhighest rainfall wheat is harvested before the dry summermonths and in that way escapes drought nevertheless lowmoisture and high temperature are considered limitingfactors for wheat production in kansas its extensive root system enables the wheat plant to obtain moisture from deep in the soil in lowrainfallareas soil moisture is depleted by continuous croppingbut is replenished by fallowing the wheat plant alsoadjusts to lowmoisture conditions by forming fewertillers producing less foliage and decreasingtranspiration the loss of water from the leaves extent of hail damage to wheat depends on the severity of the hail the growth stage when it occurs andthe variety hail before the boot stage injures wheat inproportion to the amount of foliage removed wheat ismost susceptible to hail damage from the boot stagethrough the milk stage florets on the wheat head in theboot are injured easily by hail injury during early graindevelopment stages causes the grain to stop filling at laterstages of grain development hail shatters the kernels fromthe head stems injured by hail often are broken over or offby winds or further damaged by diseases wind injury to wheat usually is caused by blown soil that accompanies the wind abrasion of the soil on theleaves and desiccation of the leaves during and after thewind cause leaf burning wind damage also is sometimesattributed to static electricity and wind without sand canburn margins and tips of wheat leaves lodging orfalling over of the wheat plant is another form of windinjury lodging is most common after heading and whengrowth has been overstimulated by excess nitrogenfertilizer or moisture high temperatures or overplanting preharvest sprouting of ripened grain occurs occasionally in eastern and central kansas when harvest isdelayed by wet conditions frequent rains high humidityand heavy dews cause kernels in the spike to absorbmoisture and start germinating severe sprouting reducesthe test weight and breadmaking quality of the grainfortunately the kansas climate resistant varieties andtimely harvest make preharvest sprouting a rare problem as wheat yields have increased roughly half that increase has been due to improved varieties with theremaining half due to improved management withenvironmental conditions so unpredictable and variableproper variety selection can make the difference betweenprofit and loss in many years so it deserves carefulattention each year obviously the primary objective is topick varieties that will give high peracre yields and thehighest possible net income but this is not a simple matter importance of yield varieties do differ in grain yield potential during the past 20 years yields have increased approximatelyonehalf bushel per acre per year due to the release ofnew improved varieties consider choosing new releasedvarieties on a regular basis perhaps every 3 to 4 years totake advantage of the higher yield potential of newvarieties high yield potential should not be the only yardstick for varietal selection and probably is not the mostimportant criterion since many factors influence actualyield in the bin generally for the top five or sixrecommended varieties all will have very good yieldpotential the key is to try to match the varietiesstrengths and minimize weaknesses so a variety has theopportunity to yield well variety strengths eg yieldpotential pest resistance or strong straw should bematched against expected field problems eg soilbornemosaic hessian fly infestation or lodging since no perfect varieties have been developed this usually resultsvarieties8in compromise and assumption of risks in order to gain advantages in other areas several different varietiesshould be planted in order to hedge against some of theunpredictable weather and pest problems the numbers problem a complicating factor in recent years is the growing number of choices it takes more time now to sift throughcharacteristics comparative performance data seedsources and relative prices than it did a few years agothe federal plant variety protection act stimulatedprivate breeding and sales of variety seed by providing aplant patent protection to originators hybrids have theirown builtin patent protection because new seed must bepurchased for planting each year in addition greatplains public breeding programs have been active inreleasing new varieties in recent years since it is not feasible for growers to individually test all varieties on their farm they must rely on othersources for their information sources include their ownneighborhood experience county agent demonstrationsand tours experiment station field days and testinformation seed company demonstrations advertisingand meetings it takes considerable effort careful studyand good judgment to make intelligent choices from allof this information use your own experience with thevarieties you have personally grown as a base forcomparisons kansas state university experiment station help the experiment station role has changed over the years varieties are not specifically recommended or endorsed by the experiment station instead varieties arecompared in scientifically conducted performance tests at16 sites over kansas each year and the results aredistributed to the public soon after harvest kansasperformance tests with winter wheat varieties inaddition many greenhouse and laboratory testscontribute information on pest tolerance baking qualityand other factors publications summarizing the abovetests are available to growers at all county extensionoffices several of the more important publications thatare updated annually and available both in hard copy andelectronically include milling and baking qualities of hard winter wheat varieties which rates varieties based upon their enduse properties kansas performance tests with winter wheat varieties which includes detailed currentyear data summary yield data over 2 3 and 4years at all locations public variety pedigrees privatecompany entries and addresses and ratings foragronomic traits disease and insect resistance andbreadbaking characteristics wheat variety disease and insect ratings provides the most recent ratings for new and established varieties and hybrids for resistance orsusceptibility to common insects and diseases attackingwheat in kansas excellent current information is also available from private publications it is advisable to obtain as muchinformation as possible before deciding on a variety toplant start with your production problems first thinkabout what problems reduced yield potential over thepast 5 years very likely there will be more than one tryto identify varieties that have strong ratings for toleranceor resistance to these problems from that list considerwhere the varieties you have chosen are best adapteddetermine if the group of varieties has been tested formilling and baking quality and try to choose the varietieswith above average ratings finally from this group pickthe top 3 or 4 varieties based on yield in performancetests over a 2 to 3 year period avoid relying on data fromfew locations or only 1 year of testing these data nomatter how reliable a specific test may be can beextremely misleading variety complementation each variety as discussed above will have specific strengths and weaknesses therefore it is recommendedthat 3 or 4 varieties be considered as the optimum forplanting on the average wheat farm in kansas becausepest problems change and the growing environments areunpredictable it is dangerous to plant only 1 or 2varieties in choosing varieties consider the pedigree ofthe variety and how similar they are to each otherplanting both karl and karl 92 for example would giveyou little diversity in variety selection because they arevery similar varieties choose varieties that havedifferent pedigrees and different growing patterns important characteristics to consider maturity early maturing varieties are more likely to escape damage from hot winds drought and rust they are moresubject to late spring freezes however producers with alarge number of acres can spread harvest by usingvarieties of differing maturity varieties or hybrids thatflower earlier than jagger or later than arapahoe may runinto production difficulties in kansas from frost damageto heads and lateseason hot winds respectivelywinter hardiness wheat is most subject to damage from cold temperatures in the fall before wheat hardens and in thespring after growth starts varieties do differ in theirsusceptibility to freeze damage rating forwinterhardiness are based on a scale of 1 highest to 9worst variety complementation is important for thistrait if you have decided to plant a variety that is ratedaverage or poor for winterhardiness you should select acomplementary second variety with more emphasis onhigher levels of winterhardiness9disease and insect resistance genetic resistance to insects and diseases is an excellent control method when such resistance is available hessian fly wheat streak mosaic soilborne mosaic stemand leaf rusts speckled leaf blotch tan spot and otherdiseases can and do cause serious losses in the kansaswheat crop use of resistant or tolerant varieties plus goodcultural practices can minimize losseslodging and shattering since wheat is harvested with the combine and harvesting must wait until the crop is ripe varieties thatdo not lodge or shatter are desired the shortersemidwarf wheats usually stand better than standardheight varieties under dry conditions where deepplanting is necessary the short coleoptiles sprouts ofsome of the semidwarfs may cause a problem inobtaining good standsgrain quality the major use of kansas wheat is bread wheat for human consumption therefore it is important that thegrain be of a quality needed by the millers and bakers toproduce a quality end product quality is determined byvariety as well as by growing conditions since quality isimportant it is essential that producers consider qualityin selecting varieties to growacid tolerance many soils in kansas are becoming more acidic due to the use of nitrogen fertilizers acidic low ph soilshave more free aluminum which can burn root tips andlead to poor vigor as a wheat producer you should beaware of the ph of your soil wheat varieties do differ intheir ability to tolerate low ph soilscoleoptile length many newer semidwarf varieties have short coleoptiles that cannot emerge from deep plantingrating for coleoptile length are based upon the standardcheck variety larned producers should be attentive ofseed planting depth if they are planting varieties withcoleoptile lengths less than 3 inchesgrazing potential many kansas wheat growers gain extra income by grazing livestock on wheat fields in the fall winter orearly spring there are differences among varieties in theamount of forage produced producers should be careful in selecting wheat varieties for grazing without sounddata although most current varieties are rated for theirgrazing potential many newly released varieties have notbeen evaluated because the grazing or clipping tests aredifficult and expensive awnless varieties can be grazedafter heading in the spring because there is reduceddanger of awns injuring livestock seed quality utilizing good quality wheat seed for planting is the foundation for obtaining excellent germination and standestablishment good quality seed is true to variety free of other crop seeds weeds foreign material disease andhas plump dense kernels of high germination seed quality is one of many factors that affects forageproduction and grain yield and can be very importantwhen planting in poor conditions such as dry soils deepplanting or late planting growers may influence forage and grain yields with decisions relating to quality of seedthat is to be planted large dense kernels are considered to be of better quality than low test weight kernels large seed tends totiller more than small seed however small dense kernels are better than large light kernels in the seed cleaning process a gravity table will remove the lightseed after seed size another factor related to seed quality is the protein content of the seed the amount of protein not protein percentage in the seed is veryimportant to early seedling vigor large seed may have a lower protein percentage than small shriveled seed butbecause it is larger it will have more total protein perseed test weight of the grain is often used as a measure of seed quality but test weight is a bulk density or aweight per volume measurement and small seed thatpacks well can have a high test weight if producers use test weight as a seed quality measurement they shoulduse seed with test weights above 57 pounds per bushelactually a high thousand kernel weight tkw is abetter measure of seed quality a 30 gram tkw which translates to 15200 seeds per pound is an appropriateminimum tkw for a seedlot there are a few varieties grown in kansas that have small seed with a lower tkwbut their seed is still suitable for planting with thesevarieties producers should utilize the largest seed theycan obtain seed cleaning and sizing is essential to remove straw chaff dirt stones weed seeds and brokendiseased or small shriveled kernels generally seed cleaning will add 1 to 2 pounds to the seedlots testweight by removing the small kernels taking a germination test is essential to determine the seedviability after seed germinability has been determined the seeding rate can be determined seed to be used for planting should be above 85 percent germinationplanting practices10another reason for seed cleaning is the fact that semidwarf varieties tend to have more seed size variability this has resulted in higher cleanout percentages although the cleanout fraction small and shriveled kernels contains seed that will germinate thisseed may germinate and emerge slower and lessuniformly and produce weaker seedlings with fewertillers than larger kernels unfortunately a few producers still use combinerun or binrun grain as a seed source to be planted seed as received by a combine is seldom in condition forplanting planting combinerun or binrun seed allows a problem weed species to spread since it is replanted withthe uncleaned wheat seed using certified seed is an excellent way to ensure the quality of a seedlot all certified seed has been cleaned and is labeled according to seed law indicating varietypercent germination and date tested percent pure seedand percent inert material the official minimum test weight for certified seed is 56 pounds per bushelcertified seed is the growers best assurance ofpurchasing excellent quality seed seed is a very lowcost item in the total production costs high quality seed usually does not cost as much in the long run as bargainseed or lowpriced seedlots poor quality seed can be expensive in terms of poor stand establishment resultingin yield losses and future problems with weeds anddiseases producers ask how often they should buy new seed they are worried the varieties they are using will revertback or not remain pure wheat is a selfpollinated crop so varieties remain true to type but some cross pollination or outcrossing can and does occur especiallywhen freezing or very cool temperatures occur at headingor flowering when outcrossing occurs and that seed is used for planting the subsequent plants may differgreatly in height and appearance from the original plantsseed contamination with other varieties is another factorcausing the wheat to look ragged with offtype plants as most producers plant three or more varieties each yearthey will purchase certified seed of one of their varietieseach year this will minimize the effect of outcrossing or contamination with hybrid wheats becoming moreprevalent producers will need to buy new seed each yearplanting saved seed of hybrid wheat will result in yieldlosses of 5 to 15 percent the following year seeding date climatic conditions vary greatly across kansas causing the recommended planting dates to vary fordifferent areas producers try to plant wheat at a time so seedlings have well established crown roots and three tofive tillers before winter dormancy thereby enabling theplants to minimize winterkill damage planting within a week of the hessian flyfree date for an area will usuallyallow enough time for adequate fall growth planting too early increases the hazards of insects and diseases suchas hessian fly leaf rust and wheat streak mosaic virusbut in areas where wheat is grazed producers will plant2 to 3 weeks earlier than they would if the wheat is to beused for grain to ensure fall growth for grazing in some areas of western kansas where available soil moisture is always a concern planting too early cancause excessive fall growth and soil moisture depletionfor early spring growth but this is not a problem formuch of the state planting later than optimum often causes limited fall growth both root and tiller formationand subjects the wheat to wind damage and increasedpotential for winterkill damage but producers may need to plant later when late rains allow grassy weeds likecheat or downy brome to germinate and need to bedestroyed by tillage also in areas where wheat is doublecropped after row crops wheat will be plantedlater than optimum figure 1 optimum planting dates in kansas zone 1september 1030zone 2september 15october 20zone 3september 25october 20zone 4october 5october 25 seeding rate seeding rates vary across kansas like seeding dates because of environmental conditions due to the lower rainfall in western kansas generally the seeding ratesare lower than in central and eastern kansas but in western kansas seeding rates have increased slightlyduring the past decade seeding rates in western kansas range from 600000 to 900000 seeds per acre planted 40to 60 pounds per acre at a rate of 15000 seeds perpound considering 80 percent germination and emergence the plant population may vary from 450000to 750000 plants per acre with lower seeding rates the plants will tiller more than with higher seeding rates a hard rain soon after planting may cause crusting and result in poor emergenceand stands producers need to determine the plant populations before they decide to replant in most areas11stands can be reduced by 50 to 60 percent with only a small effect on grain yield producers may have areas within the field that require spot replanting to preventwind erosion or weed problems in central kansas the seeding rates range from 750000 to 900000 seeds per acre 50 to 60 pounds peracre at a rate of 15000 seeds per pound final stands should be 600000 to 720000 plants per acre in eastern kansas the seeding rates range from 900000 to1125000 seeds per acre 60 to 75 pounds per acre at arate of 15000 seeds per pound with final stands of720000 to 900000 plants per acre with irrigation seeding rates may range from 900000 to 1350000 seedsper acre 60 to 90 pounds per acre at a rate of 15000seeds per pound and final stands of 720000 to1080000 plants per acre seeding rates can be adjusted upward by 10 to 20 percent if conditions are good orproducers desire quicker ground cover as planting date is delayed the seeding rate should be increased tocompensate for the lack of tillering associated withdelayed planting with wheat doublecropping after row crops or planting wheat to graze the seeding rate shouldbe increased by 50 to 100 percent also seeding rates should be increased 10 to 15 percent when using verylarge seed to compensate for fewer seeds per pound wheat can emerge from various depths but a planting depth of 1 to 2 inches is optimal in drier areas a hoe drill can place the seed deeper into moisture with deeper plantings producers should be aware of thecoleoptile length of the variety to be planted and shoulduse varieties with long coleoptiles figure 2 optimum seeding rates by areas in kansas western kansas600000 to 900000 seeds per acre central kansas750000 to 900000 seeds per acreeastern

formoisture conservation and the producers attitude towardtillage the amount of tillage for seedbed preparation hasbeen reduced during the past decade plowing which was prevalent during the 1970s and 1980s is practiced onlyon a limited basis in the continuous wheat areas of southcentral kansas producers should strive for a firm seedbed which promotes good seed to soil contact andresults in rapid germination and stand establishment atthe lowest possible cost frequently producers will till in an attempt to cover all their acres when the soils are toowet for tillage equipment this contributes to compaction and tillage pans which can cause problems later in thegrowing season in the continuous wheat areas of the state residue management is difficult most producers use 1 or 2 diskings or a chisel operation to incorporate residuesthis is followed by another disking or a field cultivatoras planting time approaches with more residues remaining on the soil surface foliar diseases such as tanspot and septoria leaf blotch have increased resistant varieties are important in this cropping system on the heavier sloping soils of eastern kansas soil erosion bywater is a major concern terraces waterways and crop residue management are required on many highlyerodible acres where crop rotations are utilized the row crop residue after harvest is left untouched until latesummer when 1 or 2 diskings or field cultivations areused before wheat seeding many producers have saved time and soil moisture by planting notill wheat doublecropped after harvest most drills are able to notill into soybean and sunflower residue in a wheat doublecropping situation notill drills are effective for planting into corn and sorghum residues if the row crop is cornsome tillage may be performed to destroy the residuewhich lowers the incidence of scab traditionally in western kansas where moisture conservation is the most important goal the wheatfallowsystem has been dominant in this system a wheat crop isproduced every 2 years summer fallowing allows soil moisture to buildup while the land is idle from one harvestthrough the next summer until wheat seeding in the fallunfortunately the wheatfallow system has a very lowwateruse efficiency tillage operations to control weeds cause soil moisture loss as little as 025 inches of rain on bare soil can seal the soil and cause rain water to runoffhowever if residues are left on the soil by utilizingconservation tillage methods soil moisture will bereplenished sooner so that a summer crop corn grainsorghum sunflower or millet can be planted to utilize thestored moisture this wheatsummer cropfallow system produces two crops in 3 years and has been shown to bemore profitable than the wheatfallow system residues reduce evaporation soil erosion and runoff and increase water infiltration and snow catch during thewinter after wheat harvest in the summer a residual triazine herbicide replaces several tillage operations to12control summer weed growth to maximize moisture savings the wheat residue is left undisturbed until the summer crop is planted notill into the stubble after the summer crop harvest the residue is left untouched until thefollowing fall when wheat can be planted notill or if thereis ample moisture in the soil profile in the spring producersmay opt to plant a summer crop again residue management residue management through conservation tillage is an effective tool for reducing soil erosion the percentage of the soil surface covered with residue isimportant in determining how much erosion will occurfrom rainfall runoff crop residue shields the soil surface from the rainfall impact thus reducing the amount ofparticle detachment residue also reduces the amount of crusting which allows more water to soak into the soiland creates numerous small dams which reduce runoffvelocities and the capacity to carry sediment standing residue increases snow catch in the winter and increasesmoisture storage for the subsequent crop in kansas the highest erosive rainfall energies occur in late may and june when the growing wheat generallyprovides adequate cover to protect against soil erosionthe potential for significant water erosion exists afterharvest because of the intense nature of thunderstormstypical of kansas summers and in the fall when littleresidue may remain as a result of cultural practices wind erosion is a serious problem in kansas particularly in late winter and early spring wind erosion is especially troublesome with wheat because inadequateresidue or growing cover exists during the critical periodcrop residue serves to reduce wind erosion by reducingthe velocity of wind that contacts the soil surface bycreating small calm air pockets that allow airborneparticles to fall back to the surface standing residue is more effective than flat residue in controlling winderosion research from neighboring states shows a 50 percent reduction in soil erosion on fields with 20 to 30 percentresidue cover as compared to cleanly tilled fields notill planting reduced soil erosion by 90 to 95 percent a 30 percent surface residue cover for water erosion control or1000 pounds of flat small grain residue or its equivalentfor wind erosion control after planting is usuallyadequate in kansas the actual level of residue required in your fields may vary

available profile nitrogen is very helpful in evaluating the amount of residual nitrogen the test measures the quantity of available nitrogen in the soilat the time the sample is collected the soil

fall seeded small grains in kansas preplant applications ofnitrogen should be incorporated into the soil by tillage orinjected directly into the soil applying nitrogen prior toseeding has several advantages among which are eliminations of one planting time operation by incorporating fertilizer application into a tillageoperation deeper placement of the nitrogen to avoid poor utilization from

applications of nitrogen may increase protein contentof the grain but have less effect on yield spring appliednitrogen in general has increased grain protein contentmore than fall applied nitrogen selection of a nitrogen fertilizer should be made on the basis of cost availability and ease of application incalculating cost of specific materials dont forget toinclude application costs research in kansas has shownall nitrogen carriers to be essentially equal in supplyingnitrogen for small grains when properly applied in years of heavy straw production an additional 20 pounds of nitrogen per ton of incorporated straw should beconsidered to help decompose the straw realizingadditional residual nitrogen may be available forsucceeding crops fertilizing for protein in recent years the average grain protein in kansas wheat has been slightly over 11 percent which is belowthe optimum for domestic flour production this lowprotein content has been the result of several factorsincluding a decline in available soil nitrogen nitrogen fertilization for ensuring high protein in wheat requires nitrogen rates in excess of those foroptimum grain production farmers undertaking afertilization program for high protein must combine thepractice with a marketing program to receive a proteinpremium to pay for the additional nitrogen additionalnitrogen applied as a topdress above the recommended

influence on competition and yieldreduction caused by weeds weeds that emerge with thewheat crop or early in the season are more competitivewith wheat than weeds that emerge later in the seasonthus winter annual weeds generally cause more yieldreductions in winter wheat than do summer annual weeds winter annual weeds generally germinate and emerge in the fall about the time wheat is planted

are those that emerge early inspring such as wild buckwheat kochia russian thistleand sunflower perennial weeds generally are not as abundant as annual weeds but are more difficult to control perennialweeds grow indefinitely over a period of years andreproduce and spread both vegetatively and by seedsmany perennial weeds produce new stems fromextensive root systems that can be spread from one areato another therefore the roots of perennial weeds mustbe killed or depleted of food reserves to achieve longterm control once established perennial weeds are verycompetitive and difficult to control field bindweed and woollyleaf bursage are examples of perennial weeds that may infest wheat these weeds arefairly tolerant to the herbicides and rates that can beapplied to the growing wheat

are essential to managewinter annual grass problems crop rotation is probably the best way to manage these weeds rotation to a summer crop helps break thelife cycle of these weeds and allows the use of tillage orherbicides during the fall or spring to prevent seedproduction and deplete seed reserves in the soilhowever crop rotation without preventing weed seedproduction will not help reduce weed populations burning and moldboard plowing wheat stubble have been shown to reduce populations of certainweeds like cheatgrass but may not be practical oracceptable due to the risk of soil erosion theeffectiveness of burning is variable and depends on theposition of the cheatgrass seed and the duration andtemperature of the burn cheatgrass seed that is mixeddown into the soil will not be very susceptible toburning while cheatgrass seed that remains up off thesoil surface is susceptible weeds with a hard seedcoatgenerally are not very susceptible to burning plowing can reduce populations of certain weeds by burying the seed deeper than it can emerge plowing isfairly effective on cheatgrass problems because the seedis fairly shortlived and cannot emerge from more than 3to 4 inches deep in the soil however plowing maysimply delay problems with other weeds such as jointedgoatgrass because the seed goes dormant when burieddeep in the soil the seed remains dormant until broughtback up to the soil surface with tillage in future years planting date also can be manipulated to reduce populations of certain weeds winter annual weedsgenerally will start to germinate early in the falldepending on soil temperatures and moisture a delay inwheat planting date until several flushes of winter annualweeds have germinated and been destroyed with tillageor herbicides decreases the total number of weedscompeting with the crop however delayed seeding maydecrease grazing and yield potential depending onclimatic conditions and planting complications w eed control with herbicides herbicides if used properly are a safe and effective option for control of certain weeds in wheat howeverherbicides will not solve all weed problems and shouldbe used only as needed in an integrated

choosing aherbicide most herbicides selectively control certainweed species as listed on the label weeds not listed onthe label probably will not be controlled herbicides should only be applied at the stages of application recommended on the label in order to achievethe desired results wheat must be in the proper stage ofgrowth to avoid crop injury application too early or latemay result in

the early 1980s to between 700000 to 800000 acres figure 5 irrigatedwheat production represents about onefourth of the 3million irrigated crop base and is the second mostcommonly irrigated crop in the state following cornusing average production figures for the past 5 yearsjust less than 7 percent of harvested wheat acres areirrigated and just over 10 percent of total productioncomes from irrigated land reported yield figuresindicate irrigated land yields increases are 50 percentmore than average dryland yield the impact is evenlarger than this since most irrigated wheat productionoccurs in fallow wheat production areas the majority of irrigated wheat production occurs in southwest kansas water use characteristics wheat can develop an extension root system with penetration to 6 feet under favorable conditions most of this growth occurs in the spring during the rapid growthperiod after breaking of dormancy a normal rootextraction pattern is to have about 70 percent of waterextraction occur in the upper onehalf of the root zonehowever root extraction studies have shown wheatcapable of extracting a substantial portion of its waterneed from the lower portion of the root zone soil waterdepletion levels can approach 80 percent of availablewater without serious yield potential reductions at mostgrowth stages however the general recommendationwould be to maintain soil water at above 50 percentdepletion to maintain yield potential throughout thegrowth cycle all crops have characteristic water use curves summer grown crops have a bell shaped curve thatindicates low daily water use needs in the spring rises toa peak usually near the beginning of crop reproductionthen falls as the crop approaches maturity wheat has thesame pattern except that it begins its cycle in the fall andis interrupted by a period of winter dormancy figure 6illustrates the general shape of wheats water use curveafter planting and emergence in the fall water useincreases as wheat establishes itself until temperatureforces it into dormancy water use begins in the springwith rapid water use increase corresponding to the rapidperiod of growth between breaking from dormancy untilheading boot to heading may be the critical stage ofgrowth for wheat although wheat is tolerant of waterstress throughout its life cycles peak daily water userates of wheat can approach 05 inches per day butnormally peak use rates will be around 035 inches perday during heading and grain development water userates drop off rapidly after grain development total seasonal water needs of wheat will vary widely depending on weather conditions but are in the range of 16to 24 inches for a wheat crop that is not water limitedimprovements in varieties and management practices haveincreased

much of kansas irrigated wheat production occurs on surfaceirrigated deep silt loam soils most often using a single fall irrigation application the fall applicationamount is generally heavy often in excess of 6 incheshowever this normally results in yields at or above thegood dryland fallow yields because of good stands andfull soil profile after irrigation normally surfacedistribution in the spring after rapid growth begins is notpractical for surface systems wheat that is beingirrigated with sprinkler systems can generally makebetter use of applied irrigation water since a smallapplication depth can be efficiently applied in the fall toassure good stand establishment and the remaining waterapplied as needed during the spring growing season thisallows better storage and utilization of both dormant andgrowing season precipitation soil water holding capacity has a large influence on which management strategies will be successful heavy fallirrigation works well on deep silt and silty clay loams withavailable water holding capacities of 20 inches per feet ormore but fall irrigation would be a failure on sandy soilswith holding capacities around 10 inch per foot or lessspecific soils information can be obtained from countysoil surveys although general soils information andexplanations can be obtained in ksu extension bulletinl904 soil water and plant relationships wheat irrigation is frequently used as a method of stretching the irrigation season since it has a growingseason that is different from the other commonlyirrigated but summer grown crops wheat also grows in aperiod when the potential demand for water is lower andsince wheat is relatively insensitive to water stress longperiods of time are available to irrigate wheat utilizinglow

problemassociated with this study is duplicating the treatmenteffect in surface irrigated production fields essentiallysurface production fields can only apply a fall preplant orafter emergence treatment and this and other studiesindicate this will be a reliable production strategy but indry years some yield loss will occur sprinkler systems generally will require 3 to 4 applications to duplicate the effect of the single heavyapplication amount this however is an advantage sinceirrigations can be withheld if no water stress developedin general scheduling by soil water status or crop wateruse will result in the highest yield potential with thelowest irrigation water input over the longterm sinceabove normal rainfall years water will be better utilized thereby reducing irrigation demand summary any amount of water applied to wheat under the normal growing conditions of western kansas and inmost years in central kansas will result in a yield increase successful wheat irrigation management isreally a matter of understanding the irrigation systemlimitations and the soil water status most surfacesystems cannot efficiently apply water after springgrowth occurs so they are limited to fall waterapplications which should achieve yields at or abovegood dryland fallow yields irrigators using sprinkler systems should not apply heavy fall irrigations since sprinkler system operators havethe option of applying additional irrigation at any time afterthe dormant season ends the soil profile can be left withroom to store winter and early spring precipitation wheatwater use is low during this time because the crop is smalland temperatures are cool this means irrigation systemswith limited capacity can build up soil water reservesshould an unusually dry winter occur however as wheatapproaches jointing soil water availability should not beallowed to deplete to less than 50 percent availablethroughout the remainder of the growing season theestimated net irrigation

however part of the crop is left inthe field or the quality of the grain harvested is less thandesirable even in good harvesting conditions combinelosses as high as 10 bushels per acre of wheat can occurin kansas in most cases a few minor adjustments candrastically reduce losses or improve grain quality sinceany additional wheat saved is clear profit and cleansamples are not docked a little extra attention to combineadjustment can pay offpreliminary adjustments as a general rule start with the machine adjusted according to the specifications in the operators manualengine speed is often taken for granted but it is one ofthe most important adjustments of all if the engine speedis too slow separator speed will also be too low andperformance will suffer once the combine is adjusted and ready to harvest be prepared to fine tune it as required to finetune acombine the functions of the machine and how they32relate must be considered the combines five basic functions are cutting and feeding threshing separatingcleaning and handling the crop moves through thecombine in this order so if one function is notperforming adequately the areas that follow will haveperformance related problems for example if the headeris too low and excess straw is entering the combinethreshing and separation will be difficult because of theexcess material cutting and feeding take place at the header and feeder house adjustments include header or cuttingheight reel height and speed and reel position foreaftcutting height is controlled by the operator as conditionschange the goal should be to harvest all grain withminimal chaff and straw the reel should be adjusted togently move wheat into the cutterbar by positioning itslightly ahead of the cutterbar it should turn slightlyfaster than ground speed and be far enough down in thewheat to lay the heads onto the platform make sure thesickle is sharp and in good condition a dull sickle canlimit ground speed and cause shatter loss crop feedingfrom the header should be uniform to ensure properthreshing threshing occurs at the cylinder or front portion of the rotor and is affected by concave clearance andcylinderrotor speed cylinderrotor speed determineshow much grain damage will occur and the amount ofseeds threshed from the head clearance will determinehow many seeds are separated and drop through theconcaves ideally threshing removes all grain from thehead without damaging grain or straw cylinder adjustment is also important since it affects the performance of the rest of the machine first verifythat the cylinder clearance indicator on the machine isaccurate the bars and concaves may be worn such thatthe clearance is greater than shown by the pointer theconcave and cylinder must be parallel from sidetosideand the cylinderconcave clearance must have the correctconvergence from fronttorear the operators manualshould include detailed instructions on checking andadjusting these items underthreshing or not completely removing grain from the head makes separation difficult it occurs whenconcave spacing is too wide or cylinder speed is tooslow overthreshing is indicated by the straw beingpulverized and broken up as a result part of the strawmay overload the shoe thus carrying grain over the backof the shoe other symptoms of overthreshing arecracked grain and excessive amounts of return thecracked grain is more likely to be blown over the shoeand even if retained in the grain tank it causes problemsin handling and storage to avoid overthreshing set thecylinder no faster and no tighter than absolutelynecessary to thresh the grain from the heads someoperators prefer to leave an occasional kernel in the headas a sign of the best balance in threshing action since threshing plays an important role in grain cleaning the cleaning shoe should not be adjusted untilsatisfactory threshing occurs shoe losses can be caused byseveral factors in addition to overthreshing narrowchaffer openings can cause grain to be carried over as canimproper fan adjustment if the chaffer is opened too wideit will overload the sieve and increase tailings chaffer andshoe openings are measured perpendicular to the louvers an underblown condition at the shoe occurs when material is not adequately suspended in the air over thechaffer this is caused by narrow openings or insufficientairflow grain should fall through the first twothirds ofthe chaffer if there is a thick mat of material on the shoegrain cannot fall through and is carried over the rear ofthe shoe if chaffer openings are too narrow grain through them is limited increasing losses and limiting the overallcapacity of the combine changing chaffer openings alsoaffects air velocity and direction therefore they shouldbe adjusted together ideally chaffer airflow andmovement suspends material over the chaffer and allowskernels to drop through to the sieve sieve openingsshould be set large enough to let all grain throughwithout allowing foreign material into the grain binhowever if they are closed to keep foreign material outreturns should be monitored to ensure there is not toomuch grain being recycled manufacturers have greatly improved the cleaning area on newer combines by developing new fans andprecleaners many changes in machines have focused onachieving more uniform airflow across the cleaning shoethese changes have improved the overall performance ofthe combine air type chaffers are popular as aftermarketequipment for combines some of these are adjustableand others are not but most of them do a good job ofremoving large straw fragments combine capacity combine capacity is the maximum rate at which a properly adjusted combine can harvest a crop whilemaintaining an acceptable loss level capacity may belimited not only by cutting and feeding or powerlimitations but also by the performance of any of thefunctional areas of threshing separating or cleaning it isimportant to relate capacity to an acceptable overall losslevel a common limitation on conventional combines inwheat is straw walker overload if the combine is pushedbeyond a reasonable rate walker overloading causes thelosses to increase rapidly with constant crop conditions feed rate will be proportional to ground speed at low to moderate feed ratesmuch of the grain is actually separated in the concave area33about 90 percent of the separation should occur in the concave leaving only 10 percent for straw walkers athigher feed rates the amount of separation in the concavearea is drastically reduced so more grain is passed onto thewalkers resulting in excessive separating losses the only way to reduce walker losses is to slow down reducing ground speed by 25 percent on an overloadedcombine can easily cut harvesting losses in half high quality wheat combine adjustment can affect wheat quality in two fundamental ways grain damage and cleanliness graindamage consists of cracked and broken kernels that makewheat harder to handle generate dust harbor insects andincrease mold growth damaged grain also can be hiddenin that the operator may not see it some damaged grainmay end up in the bin but a high portion will probablygo out the back of the machine in the form of flour andsmall fragments generally 05 to 2 percent grain damageis achievable but it can be much higher grain damage occurs mainly in the threshing area of the combine but also can be caused in the clean grainconveying system in hard threshing wheat there is atradeoff between thorough threshing and grain damagean operator may not be able to completely thresh thecrop without causing damage grain damage is usuallycaused by excessive cylinderrotor speed if slowing thecylinderrotor speed doesnt improve the grain sampleadjustment of the concave clearance may be needed foreign material also contributes to a lower quality wheat sample some weed seeds especially cheat anddowny brome are difficult to separate from wheat agood way to help is to harvest cheat infested fields lastdrier cheat is easier to clean and the yield in cleanerfields is probably higher which makes them moreimportant some general adjustments for cheat infestedfields are chaffer toward open end of recommended range sieve toward closed end of recommended range and fan toward high end following these guidelines will probably cause returns to increase so keep an eye on machine capacityto avoid pluggingalso watch your travel patterns when dealing with cheat the combine is a serious vector for weed seed ittypically takes more than 1 minute to fully dischargecheat from a combine if the combine is cutting cheatalong the edge of a field it can carry it 200 yards orfarther into the field before it is through estimating y our losses checking the machine frequently is the best way to ensure efficient harvesting during a single afternoonconditions can change enough to require resetting someof the machines components a few simple groundcounts will give an indication of combine performanceas a general rule it takes about 20 kernels of wheat persquare foot to equal one bushel per acre when spreadevenly across the field the only item needed to checklosses is a one square foot frame made out of heavy wireto carry on the combine or in the grain truck followthese steps to determine losses 1 cut through a typical area at the usual speed then stop the combine and back up about 20 feet 2 in the area behind the separator discharge lay the one foot square frame down three times and take ground counts see figure 10 average the three counts thisis the separator count 3 in the area between the cutterbar and the standing wheat take three more ground counts and averagethem dont forget to look for heads this is theheader count 4 take a final three ground counts in the standing wheat and average them this is the preharvest count 5 calculate header loss in bushels per acre header loss header count preharvest count 20 6 calculate the separator loss in bushels per acre separator loss separator count header count 80 since header width for most combines is about four times as wide as the separator it takes about 80 kernelsper square

arebased on available field research and surveys howeverthey are not applicable in every situation and ones localelevator or mill should be consulted to determine theirinsect thresholds these guidelines assume that the wheatwill be moved to market in the winter and that theobjective is to keep insect levels below detectable levels if more than two insects are found in samples take a total of five samples from each bin if lesser grain borers or weevils internal feeders are found in more than one sample or if more than one ofthese insects is found in a single sample fumigationmay be

etc are found an average oftwo per sample is usually acceptable if the grain canbe cooled to below 50 f within 2 months structures the structure in which wheat is binned can help prevent loss and

should be easy toclean and inspect it should have an aeration system thatwill allow you to cool the grain and thus limit insectdevelopment and minimize moisture migration throughthe graininsect development in kansas over 20 different species of insects are adapted to survive in grain or grain products commonstored grain insects have a life cycle of 4 to 12 monthsthey may pass from egg to adult under optimalconditions in 30 days or less females of some commonspecies can leave 300 or more eggs in the wheat within afew weeks not all insects cause damage and it isimportant to be able to recognize those that do such aslesser grain borers or weevils insect reproduction is directly related to temperature through the life requirement ranges optimal feeding andreproduction of most storage insects typically occursfrom 70 to 90 f recent research has shown that optimum conditions for lesser grain borer are between90 and 110 f for dry wheat the lesser grain borer is the most damaging insect in kansas farm stored wheatas grain temperatures drop near 60 f reproduction falls off rapidly most visible insect activity includingfeeding ceases when grain temperatures fall below 50 f sanitation sanitation is critical to maintaining wheat quality while in storage the optimum time to clean a bin isimmediately after emptying and again 4 to 6 weeks priorto refilling critical areas where infestation can normallybe found include the floor area and unloading pits orsumps other areas may include the bin walls ladderrungs and openings if debris webbing kernels etcremains attached to them after unloading handlingequipment should be used to remove debris and aerationducts removed and cleaned the area around a bin mustalso be kept free of debris not only while the grain is instorage but also while the bin is empty nearby grain or feed storage bins feed processing centers or livestock feeders can provide breeding sites forinsects insects also harbor over the winter insidecombines trucks or handling equipment harvesting andhandling equipment need to be cleaned following harvestand then scoured as soon as harvest begins new grainscours out the machinery and removes a potential sourceof infestation this scoured wheat should be fed tolivestock rather than sold to prevent infesting other wheat when it is binned newly harvested grain will most likely be at optimum temperature and moistureconditions for insect development breeding areas in theimmediate storage area are an important source of insectsthat may invade newly stored grain unless steps aretaken to prevent this crossover infestation severalgenerations of insects could develop before cold weatherimpacts the insects reproduction cycle new grain should not be stored on top of grain that has been in storage if the old grain has even a lowlevelinfestation the problem will spread upward into the mostrecently added grain extensive hidden damage may36result before the infestation reaches the surface layer where problems are more readily detected a precautionaryfumigation of old wheat should be undertaken if newwheat has to be stored on top of existing wheat bin wall treatments bin wall treatments help eliminate insects remaining in the cleaned structure structural sprays are used 4 to 6weeks before grain enters storage after cleaning the structure thoroughly walls roof and floor should be sprayed as directed on the label posttreatment waitingintervals before binning the grain should be in accordanceto product label if more than 3 months elapse fromtreatment to filling of the bin a second binwall treatmentmay be useful a second treatment must be permitted bythe product label and applied accordingly malathion methoxychlor and reldan treatments are registered for wheat storage structures malathioncannot be used if soybeans are the next crop to be storedin the structure cyfluthrin marketed as temporecently has been labeled as an empty structure spraylike methoxychlor tempo cannot be applied directlyto any grains refer to product labels for information onapplication rates and procedures protectants grain protectants are insecticides designed to be placed on the grain kernels entering storage grainprotectants retain their insecttoxic properties for anextended time period depending on the grain moisturecontent and temperature they are not highly volatile andpenetration into infested kernels is very limitedprotectants do not destroy eggs and internally feedinginsects since fatal amounts of insecticide are probably notabsorbed by these forms after application malathion and chlorpyrifosmethyl are the major ingredients labeled for direct wheat application as a grainprotectant at this writing of these two products theactive ingredient in reldan chlorpyrifosmethyl hasdemonstrated longer lasting residual control in severalresearch trials especially where wheat with higher thanrecommended moisture contents has been treatedchlorpyrifosmethyl also is more widely recognized aseffective against indian meal moth larvae than currentlylabeled rates of malathion some export and domesticcustomers are now purchasing only wheat withoutchemical residue some types of inert dusts diatomaceous earth etc are available for use as protectants against grain storageinsects inert dusts may increase grainhandlingmachinery wear due to their abrasive characteristicsthere also has been some indication that test weightsmay change following the application of an inert dust tosome grains inert dusts must carry specific label mentionof stored grains to be used this way in kansas limiteddata from field scale trials is available at this writingsurface treatments split applications may perform more consistently when applying surface dressings labels may recommendto divide the product into two or three lots apply the lotsto the grain surface based on the label recommendationsmost protectants cannot be used as surface dressings ifthey have been used applied as a protectant during binningsince the maximum residue tolerance may be exceeded slowrelease ddvp or dichlorvos strips and several formulations of bacillus thuringiensis a biological insecticide are available for use against indian mealmoth adults and larvae respectively the strips are hungin the overspace at the rate of 1 strip per 1000 cubic feetand release a volatile insecticide that permeates

penetrating gases when released from the container used to transport them thesegases readily move into infested kernels and shouldeliminate all insect life stages if applied properlyfumigants do not provide residual protection soreinfestation can occur immediately after the grain hasbeen aired out and gas concentrations fall below lethallevels field studies in kansas found october to be theoptimum time to fumigate farmstored wheat iftreatment became necessary covering the surface withplastic was required for effective fumigation fumigantsare restricted use products fumigation requiresspecialized training and wellmaintained applicationmonitoring and safety equipment it can be fatal to theuser if recommended label procedures are not closelyfollowed data from research in kansas in 1991 showedthat 35 percent of kansas farmers who fumigated somewheat used a commercial applicator unless a producer iswilling to invest the time and money necessary to acquirethe equipment and knowledge needed fumigation shouldbe left to reputable professionals aeration the purpose of aeration is to cool the wheat this reduces an insects ability to reproduce in it andminimizes temperature gradients aeration cools grain byforcing ambient air through the wheat with fans grain iscooled using aeration or drying fans aeration fans moveless than 13 cubic foot of air per minute per bushel cfm bu through the storage structure approximately 80 to120 hours are required to cool the grain depending on theairflow rate the difference between the graintemperature and outdoor air temperature should be aminimum of 10 f before an aeration fan is turned on at harvest when temperatures are above 90 f a 20f differential should be used before operating the fans37drying fans move 12 to 1 cfmbu through the grain and require less than 24 hours to cool a bin temperature differences of 15 f between grain and air are recommended when aerating with a drying fan simple or complex automated aeration controllers are available controllers automatically turn a fan onbased on preset weather and grain conditionsautomatically controlled aeration fans will cool grain 6to 8 weeks earlier when compared to manually controlledaeration fans automated aeration controllers can beeffective in cooling grain in storage earlier thusminimizing the crossover impact by running aerationfans only when the outdoor temperatures are below apreset temperature stored grain contains moisture that can be transferred within a bin primarily in response totemperature differences differences develop either whenthe surface or perimeter areas around the bin cool or heatdue to outdoor air conditions or because of insect or moldactivity moisture transfer can result in damp areas withina mass of grain that are favorable for mold developmenttemperature differences can be controlled with aeration moving the air up through the grain is generally recommended and requires exhaust vents or roofopenings after the grain has been cooled the aerationfan needs to be covered if the fan is not automated with acontroller this prevents rodents from entering beneaththe grain and reduces the potential for air currentstransferring moisture within the grain the wheat shouldbe clean and level on top to assure uniform air movementthroughout the mass aeration is ineffective in coolingwheat located in peaks peaking wheat also createsbreeding grounds for insects and molds and presentsspecial problems when fumigating monitoring best management practices require monthly inspection throughout the storage period risk of majordeterioration can effectively be eliminated by frequentmonitoring monitoring requires a grain probe moisturemeter temperature measuring device and screeningpans changes in moisture content insect activity odoror temperature can best be detected by inspections aninspection log or diary should be maintained for futurereference monitoring is more than simply scooping grain from the surface especially if it has been cooled insects mayconcentrate near the top of the grain and give a falseimpression of the infestation level warm weatherinfestations generally are near the grain surface or areasbelow the points of entry a monthly approach to samplingis to sieve several samples probed from each binpest control decisions the results of sampling will tell you if sanitation and management were successful in controlling insects there are three basic management strategies for storing wheat these do not began to include all possiblecombinations of management strategies usingprotectants fumigation and aeration all began withproper sanitation and require frequent monitoring a maximum inputlow risk strategy costs between 025 to 03 per bushel assuming no fumigation isneeded and involves1 applying a protectant at binning2 summer aeration to equalize moisture and temperature differences 3 fumigating prior to november 1 if necessary and4 aerating in late fall to cool wheat below 50 f studies indicate reldan is generally more effective than malathion if the protectant is properly applied andrecommended sanitation and monitoring practices arefollowed no fumigation may be required a chemicalresidue does remain on the wheat when using thisstrategy another practice is a fumigationaeration strategy which involves1 applying no protectant at binning2 scheduled or routine fumigation in the early fall3 continuous aeration in early fall to cool wheat below 75f and 4 aeration in late fall to cool wheat below 45 f cost for a fumigationaeration strategy ranges from 0015 to 0035 per bushel proper aeration is criticalduring the late summer and prior to first fumigation toavoid having to refumigate temperature rangeguidelines provided by the fumigant manufacturer shouldbe followed to obtain the most effective fumigation more recent field studies indicate that an automatically controlled aeration strategy can be aneffective practice and involves1 cooling wheat below 75 f by late august 2 cooling wheat by late september to 60 f 3 fumigation if necessary in early fall and4 continuing to cool the wheat below 45 f the wheat cools gradually or in intermittent periods since the fan runs only when the outdoor air temperatureandor humidity is below the controller set point automatically controlled aeration costs range from 0005 to 001 per bushel with the controllers initial costbetween 300 and 2500 depending on complexity thisstrategy can be managed manually avoids the problem ofchemical residue and has a lower cost this strategy hasbeen field tested on farms in kansas and performed well because of economic environmental and food safety concerns chemical treatment of grain should beminimal unless insect thresholds are exceeded or longterm storage is desired38kansas has long been known as the bread basket of the world because of its ability to produce high quality wheat kansas consistently ranks number one or two in theproduction of wheat with 187 and 131 percent of thetotal us wheat crop in 1994 and 1995 respectively the total acres of wheat harvested in kansas remained fairly stable during the period 199395 at about1117 million acres or about 525 percent of the statesharvested crop acres in 1995 110 million acres ofwheat were harvested approximately 2860 millionbushels of wheat were produced for an average yield of260 bushels per harvested acre each producer must answer two questions when selecting crops and the acreage of each crop to produceare 1 will this choice be profitable 2 will this addmore to
