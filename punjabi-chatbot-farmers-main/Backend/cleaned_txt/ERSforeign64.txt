trade policy formulators isthepro tracted inability tobalance theimportexport trade thepersistent disparity between exports andimports ismainly responsible forindias adverse foreign exchange position therefore efforts have been directed tostimulating exports when possible although torestrict imports remains akeypolicy over thedecade 195060 thevalue offreeworld export trade about doubled
