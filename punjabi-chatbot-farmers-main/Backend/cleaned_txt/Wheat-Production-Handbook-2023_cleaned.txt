nebraska wheat board wheat production handbook welcome to the nebraska wheat board wheat production handbook we have integrated research from various sources to produce an easytouse guide that can help you manage your crop more efficiently wheat is an important commodity in nebraska with farmers producing an average of 30 million bushels annually the grain has sustained family farms in the state for generations and filled consumer needs across the globe with a consistently highquality product it has also helped to define nebraska as a flourishing agricultural mainstay in the united states and around the world wheat has tremendous potential to return a profit to your farm and the work of the nebraska wheat board will only improve that potential over time funding for this

agronomic advantages when considering adding wheat into your crop rotation the period when winter wheat needs the most water the flowering and early grainfill state coincides with the time of year when most areas normally receive the most rain may and june as a result winter wheat usually produces a crop when irrigation is limited most of the groundwaterirrigated land will be subject to allocations of 14 to 16 inches of water for at least the next several years winter wheat also can adapt to varying amounts of precipitation wheat has a lot of ways to make grain and will provide at least half a crop even in the worst years it also works well in rotation with other crops because its peak water need falls earlier than most summer crops now grown in irrigated rotations during the growing season winter wheat is very competitive with warmseason weeds by the time these weeds come on winter wheat already has developed enough of a canopy to block the sunlight from reaching the weeds introducing wheat into more traditional irrigated crop rotations is advantageous with farmers existing schedules and workloads winter wheat can spread the workload for producers of irrigated row crops it is planted in september following dry bean harvest winter wheat also will fit into doublecrop and relaycrop rotation systems under irrigated conditions a forage crop can be planted following wheat harvest in july enabling a farmer to produce two crops in one year converting the traditional three year crop rotation dry beans sugar beetscorn into a four year rotation by adding winter wheat also had advantages sugar beets are susceptible to soilborne disease its good to allow an additional year between one sugar beet crop and the next residue management is another advantage winter wheat produces a good amount of useful and resilient crop residue many farmers have begun harvesting with stripper headers on combines which removes only the heads and leaves behind the remainder of the plant this stubble has a higher silhouette factor than other crops better protecting the soil from wind erosion during the winter it is effective in trapping snow thus increasing soil moisture at the university of illinois a team of researchers found that having wheat in the crop rotation helps increase the yield of corn and soybean crops that follow a recent threeyear summary of the results showed that corn grown in a threecrop rotation soybeanwheatcorn yielded 4 percent more than corn in a cornsoybean rotation corn in a wheatsoybeancorn rotation produced 6 percent higher yields meanwhile soybeans in both threecrop rotations yielded 4 percent more than soybeans in the cornsoybean rotation for producers considering adding wheat to their rotation late july or early august is the time to think about which variety is best nebraska crop improvement association offers a seed guide that can assist you in picking a variety that is best for you you may contact the nebraska wheat growers association for information on membership and getting started in wheat production 3the wheat kernel 4the kernel of wheat is sometimes called the wheat berry the kernel is the seed from which the wheat plant grows each tiny seed contains three distinct parts that are separated during the milling process to produce flour the endosperm makes up about 83 percent of the kernel weight and is the source of white flour the bran is about 145 percent of the kernel weight bran is included in whole wheat flour and can also be bought separately the germ is about 25 percent of the kernel weight the germ is the embryo or sprouting section of the seed often separated from flour in milling because the fat content limits flours shelflife ash content indicates milling performance and how well the endosperm separates from the bran ash content can affect flour color white flour has low ash content which is often a high priority among miller because consumers prefer white flour damaged kernels the kernels which may be undesirable for milling because of disease insect activity frost or sprout damages dockage the percentage of wheat measured by weight easily removed from a wheat sample using the carter dockage tester foreign material any material other than wheat that remains after dockage is removed because foreign material may not be removed by normal cleaning equipment it may have an adverse effect on milling quality moisture content an indicator of grain condition and store ability moisture content is often standardized 12 to 14 percent moisture basis for other tests that are affected by moisture content lower moisture levels are desired to prevent spoilage in storage protein content relates to many important processing properties such as water absorption and gluten strength and to finished product attributes such as texture and appearance higher protein dough usually absorbs more water and takes longer to mix hard red winter wheat generally has a medium to high protein content making it suitable for allpurpose flour and yeast raised flour foods shrunken and broken kernels the kernels which were either insufficiently filled during the growing season and as a result have shrunken and shriveled appearance or have been broken in handling such kernels may reduce milling yield thousandkernel weight kernel diameter provide measurements of kernel size and density important for milling quality millers tend to prefer larger berries or at least berries with a consistent size total defects the sum of damaged kernels foreign material and shrunken and broken kernels whole wheat products are made with the whole wheat kernel the bran outer layer contains the largest amount of fiber insoluble b vitamins trace minerals and a small amount of protein the endosperm middle layer contains mostly protein and carbohydrates along with small amounts of b vitamins iron and soluble fiber and the germ inner part is a rich source of trace minerals unsaturated fats b vitamins antioxidants phytochemicals and a minimal amount of highquality protein 5glossary6 wheat growth stages being able to determine the growth stage of wheat is important in deciding

determined after dockage is removed 12 diseases affecting heads grain wheat kernels infected by common bunt have a graygreen color and are wider than healthy kernels diseased kernels can be seen in developing wheat heads but are often not detected until harvest the outer layers of diseased kernels remain intact initially but are easily broken during grain harvest releasing masses of black powdery spore the fungus produces chemicals with a fishy odor which sometimes causes this disease to be referred to as stinking smut management fungicide seed treatment diseasefree seed sources 13 common bunt fusarium head blight ergotsymptoms of fusarium head blight include tan or light brown lesions encompassing one or more spikelets some diseased spikelets may have a dark brown discoloration at the base and an orange fungal mass along the lower portion of the glume grain from plants infected by fusarium head blight often shriveled and has a white chalky appearance some kernels may have a pink discoloration management avoid the most susceptible varieties avoid planting into corn residue foliar fungicides ergot is a fungus an ascomycete that forms sclerotia ascospores and conidia the sclerotia vary in size 220 millimeters long depending on the hosts seed size which the sclerotia replace and are purpleblack elongate spur like with white centers ascospores are long thin and septate conidia are small round and onecelled management use sclerotiafree seed and implement crop rotation with nonhost crops such as legumes corn and sorghum diseases affecting heads grain 14 the normal head tissue of plants infected by loose smut is completely replaced with dark masses of fungal spores giving the heads of black powdery appearance it is possible to see heads damaged by loose mut while much of the head is still inside the boot only the central stem of the head is left after the spores are released management fungicide seed treatment diseasefree seed sources sooty head molds are characterized by a dark green or black mold growth on the surface of mature wheat heads these molds are part of a naturally occurring complex of organisms that help to decay dead plant debris sooty molds are most common when mature wheat is subjected to repeated rains and delayed harvest this disease also may affect plants that have been damaged by root rot the sooty head mold growth is normally superficial its effect on grain is thought to be minor but it can make for dusty harvest operations sooty molds can contribute to discoloration of the grain called black point management generally impractical or not needed the disease causes dark brown or purple lesions on heads lesions are often more intense at the top of the glume with brown streaks or blotches extending down toward the base of the spikelet the presence of tiny fungal reproductive structures embedded in the tissue can confirm the diagnosis but will require significant magnification management genetic resistance foliar fungicides crop rotation fungicide seed treatment loose smut sooty head molds stagonospara nodorum blotchdiseases affecting leaves early symptoms of bacterial streak include small water soaked areas between leaf veins these watersoaked areas become tan streaks within a few days when the disease is severe streaks may merge to form large irregular areas of dead tissue when dew is present the bacteria causing this desase may ooze from the lesions and dry to form a clear thin flim this film flakes easily and is visible when the leaf is viewed for different perspectives management avoid highly susceptible varieties 15 bacterial streak barley yellow dwarf leaf rustthis viral disease causes wheat leaves to have a yellow or red discoloration the discoloration is often more intense near the tip of affected leaves giving them a flamelike appearance barley yellow dwarf often occurs in patches within a field the size and distribution of these patches depends on the feeding activity of aphids which spread the barley yellow dwarf virus infected plants within these patches may be shorter than neighboring healthy plants management genetic resistance delayed planting date insecticide seed treatment small orangishbrown lesions are key features of leaf rust infections these blisterlike lesions are most common on leaves but can occur on the leaf sheath which extends from the base of the leaf blade to the stem node lesions cause by leaf rust are normally smaller more round and cause less tearing of the leaf tissue than those caused by stem rust management genetic resistance foliar fungicides diseases affecting leaves powdery mildew causes white lesions on leaves and leaf sheaths glumes and awns also can be infected when the disease is severe fungal growth is largely limited to outer plant surfaces and can be easily wiped away by rubbing a finger across affected areas mature lesions may have dark reproductive structures mixed with the white cottony growth of the fungus management genetic resistance foliar fungicides 16 powdery mildew septoria tritici blotch stagonospora nodorum blotchthis fungal disease causes tan elongated lesions on wheat leaves lesions may have a yellow margin but the degree of yellowing varies among varieties the dark reproductive structures produced by the fungus are key diagnostic features and can often be seen without magnification this disease is also known as speckled leaf blotch management genetic resistance foliar fungicides crop rotation the lesions of stagonospora leaf blotch are normally brown or tan and surrounded by a thin yellow halo lesions cause by stagonospora leaf blotch are more irregular in shape and often have a darker color than those of tan spot the presence of small honeycolored fungal reproductive structures is diagnostic for stagonospora nodorum blotch however these reproductive structures are only visible with considerable magnification management genetic resistance foliar fungicides crop rotation fungicide seed treatment diseases affecting leaves plants infected with cephalosporium stripe have pronounced yellow stripes running the full length of the leaf blade the center of the yellow stripe may have a long brown streak that extends onto the leaf sheath splitting the stem of infected plants often reveals small brown streaks within the node tissue cephalosporium stripe can also cause areas of stunted irregular growth within a field often infected plants die prematurely causing patches of white heads within a field management genetic resistance crop rotation control grassy weeds 17 cephalosporium stripe stripe rust tan spotstripe rust causes yellow blisterlike lesions that are arranged in stripes the disease is most common on leaves but head tissue also can develop symptoms when the disease is severe outside the united states this disease is sometimes referred to as yellow rust management genetic resistance foliar fungicides the key diagnostic feature of tan spot is tan lesions with a yellow margin mature tan spot lesions often have a dark area in the center lesions may merge as they expand resulting in large sections of diseased leaf tissue the fungus that causes tan spot survives in the debris of previous wheat crops and produces small black reproductive structures in the spring management avoid planting into wheat residue tillage where appropriate genetic resistance foliar fungicides diseases affecting leaves winter wheat infected by wheat soil borne mosaic develops a paleyellow discoloration shortly after breaking dormancy in the spring the incidence of wheat soil borne mosaic is often greater in low areas of a field where moist soil conditions favor growth of the protozoa that spread this viral disease leaves of infected plants often have a mosaic pattern of dark green blotches on a paleyellow background symptoms normally fade when warm weather slows the viral activity within infected plants management genetic resistance 18 wheat soilborne mosaic wheat spindle streak mosaicwheat streak mosaicleaves of plants infected with wheat streak mosaic have a bright yellow streaking symptoms are often most severe near the leaf tip the virus that causes wheat streak mosaic survives in volunteer wheat and is spread by wheat curl mites the disease is often most severe in areas of a field that are closest to these sources of the disease and mites commonly plants infected with wheat streak mosaic are also infected with high plains disease and triticum mosaic the symptoms of these diseases are nearly identical disease severity is greater when plants are infected by more than one virus management control volunteer wheat delayed planting date genetic resistance avoid planting near maturing corn wheat spindle streak mosaic causes a yellow discoloration to wheat seedlings this yellow discoloration is often most intense in the wettest areas of a field leaves of infected plants have long yellow streaks that are slightly wider in the middle than at their ends symptoms are similar to wheat soil borne mosaic and plants often are infected with both diseases management genetic resistance diseases affecting stem roots 19 fusarium root stem rustcommon root rot stem rust causes blisterlike lesions on leaves leaf sheaths and stems infection of glumes and awns is also possible the reddishbrown spores of the fungus cause considerable tearing as they burst through the outer layers of the plant tissues mature stem rust lesions are more elongated than those of leaf rust management genetic resistance foliar fungicides common root rot causes premature death of wheat resulting in patches of white heads scattered throughout a field infected plants are often dark at the base and have poor root development a key diagnostic feature of common root rot is darkbrown lesions on the thin stem extending from the base of the plant to the remnant of the seed this stem is known as the subcrown internode healthy subcrown internodes should be cream colored and firm management crop rotation control grassy weeds fusarium root crown and foot rots cause patches of wheat to die prematurely resulting in areas of white heads within a field infected plants are typically brown at the base and have poor root development during advanced stages of the disease the fusarium fungus often produces a pink cottony growth inside the lower portions of the stem often the disease is most severe after prolonged periods of dry weather management crop rotation control grassy weeds takeall this fungal disease causes wheat to die prematurely resulting in patches of white heads in otherwise green fields of wheat plants infected by takeall normally have a black discoloration of the lower stem and roots frequently the disease is most severe in wet areas of a field and near field edges where the fungus survives in association with grassy weeds management crop rotation control grassy weedsinsect management 20 aphids chinch bugsrussian wheat aphid newlyhatched bugs are small and bright red all life stages feed on susceptible grass plants between the leaf sheath and stalk they are red to brown with a white band across their backs during the first four stages the fifth nymphal stage is nearly black with a white spot between the developing wings chinch bugs have piercingsucking mouthparts at all stages they injure host plants by sucking plant juices they have a characteristic musty odor that is detectable when large numbers are present or when the bugs are crushed management integrated program of careful crop management and insecticide application aphids are small softbodied insects that obtain their nutrition by sucking sap from plants they have two cornicles that protrude from the upper surface of the abdomen near the tail these tailpipes vary in length and may be reduced to mere bumps in some species during feeding aphids inject salivary secretions into plant tissues the salivary secretions of some aphids are toxic and can cause severe tissue damage in the plant symptoms of aphid injury include leaf stippling discoloration or striping in addition wilting premature browning and death of the plants may result management controlling volunteer wheat avoiding early planting of winter wheat and maintaining a healthy crop will help minimize risks monitoring aphid populations in the fall and spring and following treatment guidelines are necessary to minimize the risk of serious lossesbird cherryoat aphid the hessian fly passes through two generations per year in which adult flies deqposit eggs maggots hatch on the leaves and feed on the stalks and after feeding the maggots pupate into a form commonly recognized as flaxseeds the flaxseed pupae can often be located near the infested tiller in the spring or associated with broken stems oberved in the early summer management plant varieties that are resistant to the hessian fly and plant wheat in the fall after the late summer adult egg laying period has passed hessian flyinsect management 21 wheat curl mite sawflywireworms the adult sawfly is a slender wasp about 12 inch along with a black abdomen and yellow ringed markings when observed in the field sawflies may be recognized by the unusual habit of resting head downward on the stems of grain plants sawfly damage is threefold first they cause grain yield reduction by their tunneling activity in the infested stems additional loss occurs when sawflycut stems fall to the ground and become unharvestable the protein content of grain from the infested stems is also lower management crop rotation delayed planting and fall tillage these insects may spend the winter as adults or larvae adults are about 14 to 34 inch long hard shelled brown to nearly black with a streamlined body the adults are called click beetles because when they are on their backs they will flip up and turn over with a clicking noise larvae live from two to six years in the soil feeding primarily on roots wireworms eat the germ of the seeds or hollow them out completely leaving only the seed coat management wireworms are among the most difficult insects to control planter box insecticide seed treatments will reduce damage to the seeds but will not protect seedlings these mites are wingless cigarshaped and approximately 02 millimeters in length unless found in extremely high numbers these mites generally cause little direct damage in the field other than the characteristic leaf curling and the occasional trapping of the flag leaf however both immature and adult wheat curl mites transmit wheat streak mosaic virus management chemical control of mites is believed to be largely ineffective as they predominantly live within leaf whorls volunteer wheat and grasses should be destroyed at least 10 days prior to planting in the fall to limit vector survival armyworms in autumn fall armyworms may be a problem in seedling plants fall armyworms feed on the young plants and eat the plants to the ground causing a loss of stand damage of this type may occur from emergence until a bad frost or freeze eliminates the threat of armyworms wheat will usually recover from moderate fall armyworm damage in the spring true armyworms are a threat about the time heading begins wheat is very attractive to the armyworm and thick vigorously growing fields can attract high infestations occasionally when wheat starts to mature armyworms will move up from leaf feeding and cut the wheat heads from the plant stem management an infestation level of five to six worms per square foot will justify treatment treat only with liquid insecticides during the warmer part of the day field history field number crop variety acres date seeded tillage operations fertilizers
