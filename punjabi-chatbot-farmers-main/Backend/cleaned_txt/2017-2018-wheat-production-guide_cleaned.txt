the previous year following the overall decline observed over the past three years profitable wheat management was challenged by the weak market coupled with disease pressure and environmental conditions in 2017 growers harvested only 70000 acres with a state average yield of 47 bushels per acre above average temperatures through the fall and winter generally reduced vernalization especially for medium to latematuring varieties with extended vernalization requirements georgia also experienced a late frost in midmarch which resulted in added damage to the wheat crop in some areas of the state these environmental issues combined with additional damage and costs due to another year of fusarium head blight fhb infection had significant impact on yield and returns here are a few critical items to consider in preparation for the 20172018 wheat season 1 prepare ground well in advance for planting this will enable timely planting when adequate rainfall occurs for germination optimum planting dates will be the week prior to and week after the average first frost date for your area be conscious of soil moisture and try to time planting with rainfall events to maximize emergence 2 partition some of your nitrogen fertilizer for the early season at planting or shortly after to support fall tiller production approximately 85 of yield potential comes from fall tillers 3 choose top yielding varieties for your area with good disease resistance and good stalk strength if fusarium head blight is a concern pay close attention to resistance ratings in the variety characteristics table as fhb resistance is somewhat limited in current varieties the occurrence of head blight infection depends largely on weather conditions during the flowering stage 4 be prepared to control weeds early planting on time will enable you to apply your herbicides early and maximize your control avoid revenge killing and control weeds early to reduce competition and protect yield potential 1 recommended wheat varieties for fall planting 20172018 one of the most important decisions to make for profitable wheat production is choosing the right variety or varieties to plant many differences exist among the varieties and it is critical to assess what characteristics are most important in a given production area growers should choose multiple varieties to plant to reduce risk and improve chances of success every season the following informa tion tables 14 is provided to compare and understand the differences between each of the varieties recommended in georgia in table 1

following url httpwwwcaesugaeducommoditiesfieldcropsgagrainsindexhtml 6 land preparation and traffic patterns reagan l noland and dewey lee the soil environment plays a critical role in optimizing wheat growth and development research from alabama georgia and south carolina has consistently shown increased wheat yields with deep tillage in fields with a hard pan or compacted soils tillage enables easier root growth and penetration increasing the potential for water and nutrient uptake tillage also serves to reduce surface residue that may host diseases and pests in wet years compacted dense soils can result in very low soiloxygen conditions which can reduce yields of most small grains due to poor root production and nutrient uptake notill is less common in wheat production due to observed yield reductions ranging from 3 to 20 with the understanding that no till management often has a wheat yield penalty it may be considered as a decision for the whole farm system to reduce erosion and save on tillage costs disking is a common tillage practice that can provide an excellent seedbed but may lead to the formation of a compacted layer of soil the weight of the implement is concentrated in a very small area at the tip of the disk and when disking is repeated several times a hardpan can form deep tillage bottom or paraplowing or vripping is the most reliable tillage option to optimize yield potential it is slower and more expensive than disking but is usually cost effective with improved yields when doublecropping field operations make it impractical to deep till chiseling or subsoiling can be a beneficial alternative consistent and proper seed placement will influence the uniformity of emergence final stand and potential yield of wheat good seed soil contact with soil moisture promotes rapid emergence and good root development wheat should be planted at least 1 to 15 inches deep when soil moisture is adequate for good germination take care to achieve uniform planting depth as poor depth control leaves seed too deep or too shallow for uniform emergence planting wheat with a properly calibrated drill is preferred over broadcasting as uniform emergence is very difficult to achieve when broadcasting wheat studies conducted in the southeastern us demonstrate that higher yields are consistently achieved with a properly calibrated drill compared with broadcasting establishing a row traffic pattern at planting or soon after emergence for all postemergence field traffic can be beneficial traffic patterns or tramlines can be established by closing one or more openings in the drill when planting the crop this can be done by retrofitting the drill with clutches attached to the metering cup that can close the opening to leave unplanted rows that match the wheel spacing of your sprayer or tractor devices for drills can be purchased to establish tramlines on any tractor width in any multiple of drill widths tramlines may also be established after the crop has emerged by chemically killing the rows with glyphosate that match the wheel spacing of the implement used to apply fertilizer or pesticides precision agriculture tools such as light bars and gps guidance systems can help reduce the error of overlapping when chemically killing rows to establish tramlines this method should be applied early once the wheat has one to two developed leaves using tramlines in intensively managed wheat enables uniform applications of nutrients and pesticides with improved precision and timeliness tramlines can save on the cost of aerial applications and can reduce the chance of disease development when compared to plants that are 7 crushed by running over standing wheat studies have shown that the border plants will compensate 50 to 60 of the yield lost by the missing rows whereas plants damaged by tires rarely produce good grain 8 planting dates reagan l noland and dewey lee planting date is another critical component of successful wheat production planting too early or too late reduces yield potential always plant late maturing varieties first since these varieties most often have the longest vernalization requirements recognize though that some medium maturing varieties may have also have long vernalization requirements which makes them less suitable for late planting vernalization requirement varies widely with variety in order for wheat to vernalize temperatures must be low and remain cold for a specific length of time in the absence of cold weather wheat waits until enough heat units have accumulated and nights are short before heading this delay in heading usually results in wheat filling the grain during a hot and dry time of the year such as may or early june the warmer the temperature during grain fill the poorer the yield and we ight if planting late in the season choose an early maturing variety because they have in general very low vernalization requirements this ensures the crop will vernalize properly even in a mild or warm winter caution should be taken to avoid planting these types of varieties too early in the season due to their short season growing abilities these varieties may enter the jointing and heading phase too quickly and therefore be subject to severe winter kill or damage from late spring freezes in fact varieties with very short vernalization requirements such as ags 2040 coker 9700 etc often perform best when planted between december 1 and december 15th in this case the recommended planting dates are two weeks later than the recommended dates for most other varieties the effect of planting date on three popular varieties are shown in tables 6 notice the loss in yield at the late planting date with the late maturing variety this variety requires longer vernalization and growing degree days than the early or medium maturing varieties the effects of late planting can be severe depending on variety table 6 effect of

yields are penalized as planting is delayed into the winter it is important to plant within the recommended planting time for high yields table 7 effect of planting date on yield bua of soft red

to pd2 is the recommended time period for each region table 8 lists the recommended planting dates for different regions of the state these dates represent a tradeoff between planting early enough for adequate tillering before cold weather begins and planting late enough to avoid excessive heat and moisture stress in many parts of the country planting dates are set late in order to avoid problems with the hessian fly but in georgia there is no such thing as a flyfree date the optimum window for wheat planting in georgia is typically within one week before or after the average first frost date for a given area planting during the appropriate time for your area will allow wheat to develop enough tillers prior to january or early february which reduces the likelihood of needing two applications of n fertilizer in the spring fall produced tillers will have 10 stronger root systems tolerate more stress and produce larger heads with greater potential for high test weig ht studies show that fall tillers account for about 85 of the yield if the crop is planted late and plants do not tiller well prior to the onset of winter days then the crop will be dependent of spring tillers spring tillers generally have smaller heads fewer spikelets and le ss opportunity to produce grain planting ontime ensures the best chance to obtain the proper number of tillers by gs 30 or stem elongation high yield wheat requires about 100 tillers per square foot at gs 30 if your stand has fewer tillers ie 50 to 60 by gs 25 then early nitrogen applications will be needed to support additional tiller production see the fertility section for additional info only varieties with short vernalization requirements table 8 general planting times for most wheat varieties grown in georgia

coastal plains december 1 december 15 11 seeding rates reagan l noland and dewey lee optimum seeding rates for wheat can vary widely due to differences in seed quality genetics planting conditions or planting dates and planting methods drill or broadcast seeding based on seeds per acre is much more accurate than seeding based on weight per acre multiple seeding rates studies have been conducted throughout the southeastern us and most show that seeding 12 million to 15 million seeds per acre is optimum this is equal to seeding about 30 35 seeds per square foot however achieving this rate will require knowledge of seed size akanumber of seeds per pound in a normal year wheat cultivars vary between 10000 and 18000 seeds per pound this difference can impact the actual seeding rate if a grower seeds wheat in bushels per acre for example in table 8 seeds per pound of variety 4 and variety 6 vary by 35 if a grower planted according to bushels per acre he would plant 35 more seed of variety 6 than variety 4 potentially overplanting or underplanting one of the cultivars this illustrates the importance of purchasing wheat seed based on seeds per pound with a target of 3035 seeds per square foot rather than bushels per acre table 9 example of seeds per pound of wheat grown in one year in georgia variety seedpound 1 9610 2 11340 3 14823 4 12064 5 11172 6 16316 7 12741 8 14538 9 15534 average seeds per pound 13126 information in table 10 provides appropriate seeds per row foot for various row widths when planting on 75 inch row widths each linear foot of row should contain 2025 seeds depending on germination this provides enough seed to achieve the target number of live plants per acre for high yield if planting date is delayed seeding rates should be increased by 1520 the use of certified seed will help insure you are planting seed with a minimum germination of 85 and free of noxious weeds planting b inrun seed is not recommended for intensively managed wheat however it is important to test for germination if you choose to use binrun seed thorough seed cleaning will often increase the germination of a seed lot because it eliminates some nonviable seed 12 information in table 11 illustrates the differences in pounds per acre between two lots of seed planted at various row widths and seeds per row foot if you had a variety with approximately 12000 seeds per pound and you planted on a 75 inch row width with a target of 22 seeds per row foot then you would need to purchase 128 lbs of seed per acre if the seed were small er and the variety had 15000 seed per pound then you would need to purchase only 102 lbs per acre to achieve the same target population yield potential is maintained when wheat is planted as accurately as possible therefore calibrate grain drills each time you change cultivar or seed lots to achieve the desired number of plants per acre calibrating a drill can be as simple as filling the bottom portion of the seed hopper and catching seed from the down spout that leads to disk openers first measure off a known distance that you can calibrate to an acre remove the rubber tubes that lead to the disk openers use individual plastic bags or small bottles to catch seed from several tubes as you travel the known distance then count the number of seed or weigh the amount of seed captured then determine if you captured the a ppropriate amount for the desired seeding rate by distance or by determining the amount by weight needed to get the amount of seed by pounds you will have to know the number of seeds per pound to determine the amount by weight table 11 an example of p ounds of seed per acre as determined by row width see ding rate and seeds per pound row width 6 75 10 seedrow ft 12000 15000 12000

utilization has become increasingly important in the economic value of wheat production there are many uses of wheat straw such as residue for conservation tillage landscaping residue to reduce soil erosion during road or building construction mushroom production horse bedding hay feeding and others varieties vary in their ability to produce straw from year to year table 12 is provided to demonstrate the range of straw heights and production across wheat varieties in griffin ga in general higher grain yield correlates to greater straw production if the straw is removed from the field remember to apply the same amount of nutrients to the subsequent crop that are removed by the straw table 12 example of straw yield of different soft red winter wheat varieties lbsa griffin variety

primary yield building components of small grain management a properly managed fertility program including recommended fertilization and liming practices can improve yield and quality more than any other single management practice such a program includes soil testing knowledge of crop nutrient requirements and removal timely application of nutrients and recordkeeping nutrient uptake and removal varies with yield table 13 most fertilizer recommendations account only for nutrients removed in the grain when straw is also removed additions of phosphorus p potassium k and sulfur s should be increased for the following crop table 13 nutrient uptake and nutrient removal by wheat at different yield levels removal based on grain only yield bua 40 70 100 nutrient uptake removal uptake removal

key management factors for making good wheat yields nitrogen rates should be based on soil potential cultivar realistic yield goal previous crop and residual n for expected wheat yields of 40 to 70 bushels per acre use a total n rate of 80 to 100 pounds per acre higher yields will likely require rates of 100 to 130 lbs per acre or more apply nitrogen in the fall is critical to encourage good tiller production prior to the onset of winter adjust this rate based on the preceding crop in general apply n based on the previous crop rotation as follows cotton 35 to 40 lbs ac corn 30 to 35 lbs ac fallow 25 to 30 lbs ac soybeans 15 to 20 lbs ac peanuts 0 to 15 lbs ac 15 tillers produced in the fall generally produce the most grain per unit area it is important though not to overfertilize with nitrogen in the fall as it may cause excessive growth and result in winter injury timing of n fertilization should be based on the pattern of uptake by the crop demand for n is relatively low in the fall but increases rapidly in the spring just prior to stem elongation therefore make the fall applications of nitrogen at planting and the remaining n prior to stem elongation zadoks 30 use the lower rate of fall applied nitrogen at planting on heavier textured soils and the higher rate on sandy soils when the wheat crop reaches the growth stage zadoks gs 25 begin counting tillers to determine the need for additional nitrogen applications for the proper tiller production prior to the onset of stem elongation this stage of growth generally occurs during the mid to later week of january in south ga and late january to midfebruary in north ga randomly chose about 10 to 15 areas in the field to obtain an accurate estimate of tillers per square foot the graph below can be used to get a nitrogen rate recommendation after counting the tillers if the tiller counts a stem with at least three leaves are low 80 tillers per square foot or less nitrogen applications at this time are critical for improving the yield potential of the crop some nitrogen will still be needed to maximize the yield potential if the tiller counts are lower than 100 if the tiller count exceeds 100 or more per square foot at zadoks gs 25 then apply all remaining nitrogen at or just before gs 30 stem elongation usually zadoks gs 30 or feekes 5 occurs during early to mid february in the southern half of georgia in extreme n ga stem elongation may not occur till early march splitting spring nitrogen applications can improve yields when n leaching conditions occur although yields may not always be improved this practice can also reduce the amount of n released into the environment and offers the chance to adjust n rates downward if climatic or economic conditions do not warrant the added expense of the last n application the graph below is a guide used by growers in north carolina and virginia to determine the 16 need for nitrogen at gs 30 or feekes 5 it assumes that the average tiller count will be above 100 per square foot gs 30 is when the leaf sheaths of the wheat plant are strongly erected and splitting the stem shows a hollow internode area about 14 to 12 inch in length it is important to have an accurate assessment of the nitrogen content at the right growth stage prior to completing the final n applications obtain a representative tissue sample from about 20 areas in the field cut the samples about inch above the soil surface making sure to shake any dirt away from the tissue pi ck away any debris or dead leaves from the sample combine the samples and mix thoroughly take two to three handfuls out of the combined sample for testing and place in a paper bag send the sample immediately to an appropriate lab use the graph below to obtain the rate recommendation from tissue test results taken just prior to the onset of stem elongation total n applications generally should not exceed 130 lbs n per acre make the final n adjustments based on these results for example lets say the tissue analysis results show a 30 n content at gs 30 but you applied 20 lbs n at planting and 40 lbs n at gs 25 if the graph calls for 80 lbs then only apply 70 of the 80 lbs of n the graph suggest since it would exceed the upper limit of 130 lbs n in the season 20 40 60 60 70 130 nitrogen fertilizer prices have increased significantly over the last five years but declined slightly this fall as compared to last year therefore choosing the proper rate and timing of application is critical in terms of making an economic yield also there are still a good number of different nitrogen fertilizers to choose from that vary in characteristics and price be careful not to choose a nitrogen fertilizer based on price alone in addition there is currently a shift away from ammonium nitrate to urea urea volatilization is of greater concern under hot and dry conditions the timing of n applications on wheat are typically not that conducive to losing large amounts of n from urea irrigation or rainfall can also reduce n losses from volatilization of urea urease inhibitors such as agrotain are commercially available and when added to urea can reduce volatilization losses especially in dryland conditions 17 other nutrients since 65 of the total p uptake and 90 of the total k uptake occurs before the boot stage these nutrients should be applied according to soil test before planting and thoroughly incorporated into the rooting zone when double cropping after wheat apply p and k for fall and spring crops prior to fall planting except on deep sands in this case split k applications between the fall and spring crops sulfur s leaches readily in sandy soil horizons but accumulates in subsoil clay horizons if the depth to clay is greater than 16 inches apply at least 10 pounds of s per acre best results are obtained when s is supplied with topdress n applications micronutrient levels in georgias soils are usually adequate for wheat production unless soils have been overlimed low zinc zn levels may occur in soils of the coastal plain a soil test readily detects these conditions and it is easily corrected by applications of three pounds of elemental zn per acre in the preplant fertilizer manganese mn deficiency occurs most frequently in poorly drained soils of the flatwoods region availability of mn declines significantly as ph increases above 62 to 65 in these soils soil applications seldom correct the problem since mn is readily converted to unavailable forms foliar applications of 05 pounds of mn per acre as mnso 4 or 025 pounds of mn per acre as mn chelate will correct deficiencies but two or more applications may be required poultry litter managed properly poultry litter manure mixed with bedding material can be a valuable source of plant nutrients for wheat production it is most like a complete fertilizer containing significant amounts of primary secondary and micronutrients except for boron on average broiler litter contains approximately 3 n 3 p 2o5 and 2 k 2o fertilizer value of 33 2 based on this average one ton of poultry litter contains 60 lbs of n 40 lbs of p 2o5 and 40 lbs of k2o based on current fertilizer prices for n p and k poultry litter is valued at approximately 50ton this figure does take into account that only 60 of the total n is available to the first crop and p and k 80 also the nutrient content of litter does vary significantly depending on moisture content type of bird feed ration and especially storage and handling methods therefore it is highly recommended that litter be analyzed for nutrients by a reputable laboratory before determining application rates and value application rates of poultry litter for fertilizer are usually based on the nitrogen requirement for the crop grown buildup of phosphorus however is an increasing concern due to water quality issues therefore poultry litter is best used as a preplant incorporated complete fertilizer to supply p k secondary and micronutrients to the crop on a timely basis for wheat an application of 2 tona of poultry litter preplant incorporated will supply an adequate amount of fall n and should meet the p and k requirements of even a soil testing low in p and k the remainder of the n requirement should then be applied in the spring using inorganiccommercial n fertilizer release of n from litter in the spring will depend on a number of factors especially weather conditions therefore the crop should be monitored in the spring and topdress applications of inorganic commercial fertilizer n should be adjusted accordingly 18 weed control in wheat stanley clup epper effective weed management is one of many critical components of successful wheat production weeds compete with wheat for light nutrients water and space while often harboring deleterious insects and diseases severe weed infestations can essentially eliminate wheat production andor harvest efficiency while also creating weedy plant fragments often reducing food and feed value winter annual broadleaf weeds such as wild radish common chickweed and henbit perennials such as wild garlic and curly dock and italian ryegrass are often the most problematic weeds in wheat in fact wheat production in georgia is in jeopardy as a result of weed resistance ryegrass resistant to all currently labeled postemergence herbicides has been documented and is becoming more common growers must implement management programs to delay the development or spread of resistant ryegrass cultural control methods one of the best tools for suppressing weeds in wheat is a healthy vigorous crop good crop management practices that result in rapid wheat stand establishment and canopy development minimize the effects of weeds recommended cultural practices include the following 1 planting certified seed free of weed seeds and garlic bulblets 2 good seedbed preparation including free of emerged weeds at planting 3 proper fertilization 4 seeding at the proper rate planting depth and time of year 5 management of diseases and insects site selection also is important for weed control rotation away from fields infested with troublesome weed species such as herbicideresistant ryegrass may reduce the presence of these weeds and allow for the use of alternative crops and control methods additionally so as to prevent weed spread from field to field during harvest equipment should be cleaned when moving from infested areas this precaution can be of significant consequence in preventing or minimizing the introduction of new weed species into clean areas when commercial combine operators who travel long distances are used for harvest planning a herbicide program before using herbicides growers should know what weeds are present or expected to appear soil characteristics such as texture and organic matter content capabilities and limitations including carryover of the various herbicides how best to apply each herbicide and of extreme importance is knowing when to apply each herbicide relative to crop and weed stage of growth weed mapping the first step in a weed management program is to identify the problem this task is best accomplished by weed mapping surveys should be developed each spring to provide a written record of the species present and their population levels 19 inseason monitoring fields should be monitored periodically to identify the need for postemergence herbicides even after herbicides are applied monitoring should be continued to evaluate the success of the weed management program and to determine the need for additional control tactics proper weed identification is necessary to ensure effective control since weed species respond differently to various herbicides contact your local extension office for aid in weed identification managing weeds with herbicides if applying herbicides read and follow label recommendations information concerning weed response to herbicides herbicide rates and grazing restrictions for wheat are provided in tables 16 17 and 18 refer to product labels for up todate suggestions and restrictions larger weeds are often more difficult to control than smaller weeds therefore timely herbicide applications are critical many herbicides used in wheat affect growth processes within the weed in essence the more actively the plant is growing the better the control applications made to stressed weeds ie drought wet cold will often result in decreased control all wheat herbicides are restricted to certain growth stages to minimize crop injury table 14 andor to ensure illegal pesticide residues are avoided although the stage of development provides a good indicator for application timing factors such as environmental conditions health of the crop and variety early vs late maturity also have an impact on crop tolerance table 14 the effect of stage of growth on wheat injury by various herbicides percent injury by stage of growth1 2 herbicide 01

however 24d often does not adequately control chickweed and henbit thus mixtures with harmony extra or express are advised this phenoxy herbicide is available in several formulations amines esters and acid ester mixtures ester or acid ester formulations tend to be more effective under very cold conditions as compared to amine formulations rarely are large differences noted among formulations additionally ester and acid ester formulations mix well with liquid nitrogen amine formulations can usually be mixed with liquid nitrogen but the amine herbicide often must first be premixed with water one part herbicide to four parts water and then the waterherbicide mixture added to the nitrogen with good agitation amines tend to cause less burn on the wheat than esters when nitrogen is used as the carrier amine formulations of 24d are much safer to use when sensitive plants are nearby volatility of ester and acid ester formulations of 24d can be significant georgia research has shown nearly 90 less impact from volatility of an amine formulation of 24 d when compared to an ester formulation of 24 d during hot weather timing of application of 24d is critical to avoid injury to wheat the critical period for 24 d applications is after wheat is fully tillered but before jointing feekes stages 4 and 5 figure 1 application before this growth stage may cause a rat tail effect whereby the leaf does not form and unfurl properly the crop may appear stunted and delayed in maturity and tiller development may be adversely affected conversely application after jointing has commenced may result in malformed seed heads often reducing yield mcpa is similar to 24d in that it is a phenoxy herbicide controlling a broad spectrum of broadleaf weeds table 16 when compared to 24d mcpa is generally less injurious to wheat but also less effective on larger weed species application of mcpa is after wheat tillers preferably 2 tillers at a rate of 12 to 16 oza 37 to 40 lb ai material up to just before jointing if wheat is fully tillered a rate of 1 to 15 pta may be applied figure 1 mcpa plus harmony extra offers weed control similar to 24d plus harmony extra with less crop injury potential harmony extra is a prepackaged mixture of the sulfonylurea herbicides thifensulfuronmethyl and tribenuronmethyl and can be applied in wheat after the twoleaf stage but before the flag leaf is visible figure 1 applications should be completed by the fully tillered stage for improved spray coverage on weeds harmony extra controls many of the common winter annual broadleaf weeds including wild garlic and curly dock table 16 however cornflower and wild radish are exceptions while henbit can be challenging to control depending on its physiological maturity mcpa or 24d at 0375 pound active ingredient per acre may be mixed with harmony extra for excellent wild radish control and 21 improved control of cornflower these mixtures must follow the application growth stage restrictions noted with 24d or mcpa a nonionic surfactant at the rate of 1 quart per 100 gallons of spray solution is recommended when harmony extra is applied in water harmony extra also may be applied using liquid nitrogen as the carrier in this case premix the herbicide in water and add the mixture to the nitrogen with agitation adding surfactant when using nitrogen as a carrier will increase burn on the wheat foliage thus when applying harmony extra in nitrogen reduce the surfactant rate to 05 to 10 pint per 100 gallons of spray solution for easy tocontrol weeds consider eliminating the surfactant when nitrogen is the carrier however do not eliminate surfactant when treating wild garlic or wild radish do not use surfactant when mixtures of harmony extra plus 24d or mcpa are applied in nitrogen an advantage of harmony extra compared to 24d or mcpa is the wide window of application however tank mixtures of these herbicides are suggested for wheat in the appropriate growth stage see table 17 for the appropriate rate depending on the formulation used express tribenuron and peak prosulfuron are sulfonylurea herbicides that are effective on many winter annual broadleaf weeds table 16 however harmony extra is superior to express in controlling henbit shepherds purse and wild garlic peak is often the most effective option for controlling wild garlic but a 10 month rotation restriction for soybeans peanuts and cotton exist for peak at 075 oz of product per acre express can be applied after the wheat has two leaves but before the flag leaf is visible figure 1 peak can be applied after wheat has reached the threeleaf stage but before the second detectable node of stem elongation these herbicides also have an advantage over the phenoxytype compounds such as 24d because they can be used later in the season similar to harmony extra express may be tank mixed with 0375 lb active ingredient of 24d or mcpa for improved control of wild radish express may be also be slurried with water and then added to liquid nitrogen solutions use 10 qt of surfactant per 100 gallons of spray solution when applying express in water use 1 pt of surfactant per 100 gallons when mixing with nitrogen 24d or mcpa use pt of surfactant per 100 gallons when mixing with nitrogen plus 24d or mcpa 22 wild ra dish control wild radish can be controlled effectively with numerous herbicide options table 15 harmony extra mcpa or 24d is suggested to control wild radish as well as most other commonly present broadleaf weeds powerflex an effective ryegrass herbicide is also a very

postemergence herbicides has been documented and is becoming more common growers must implement management programs to delay the development or spread of resistant ryegrass immediately research has shown that wheat yields can be reduced 04 for every ryegrass plant per square yard heavy infestations if uncontrolled can eliminate production italian and annual ryegrasses are annuals with spread through seed production management practices to reduce seed production and spread will greatly decrease ryegrass problems such practices may include the following cleaning equipment from field to field maintaining clean fence rows and ditch banks surrounding the fields avoiding those fields with heavy ryegrass populations and avoiding saving and then planting seed harvested from fields infested with ryegrass the previous season additionally research has confirmed deep turning can have a significant influence on the emergence of annual ryegrass the graph and picture below note how effective deep turning may be in reducing ryegrass emergence by spring in this experiment ryegrass emergence was reduced over 99 with deep turning although this experiment does not address ryegrass seed spread throughout the soil profile which is present in grower fields it does suggest ryegrass seed do not emerge very well when placed deep in the soil profile the next step is to understand how long the seed will live buried in our soils and our environment rarely will any cultural or mechanical practice effectively control ryegrass by itself thus an herbicide program will usually be needed options include the following axial xl active ingredient pinoxaden at 164 fl oza can be applied postemergence to wheat having at least two leaves up to preboot stage figure 1 ryegrass resistant to hoelon may be cross resistant to axial xl although in many cases axial xl is still effective in georgia apply in no less than 10 gallons of water per acre rain falling 30 minutes after application will not impact control axial can be applied only once per crop and will not offer residual control 24 axial may be mixed with harmony extra for broadleaf weed control add the harmony first then axial xl according to the label axial xl may also be applied in mixture with liquid nitrogen fertilizers with up to 50 liquid nitrogen by volume add water to the tank then add axial xl mix thoroughly and then add nitrogen the university of georgia recommends strongly against mixing axial xl with nitrogen fertilizer as a carrier because of the potential for reduced ryegrass control labeled rotational crop restrictions include 30 days for leafy and root crops and 120 days for all other crops including other cereal grains axiom active ingredients flufenacet and metribuzin can be applied to wheat after the spike stage of growth up to the 2 leaf stage figure 1 preemergence applications can cause severe crop injury especially on sandier soils when conditions are wet during crop emergence injury has also been observed occasionally when axiom is applied during the spike stage of growth if heavy rains or recurring rainfallsirrigation occur within a few days of application if axiom is activated prior to ryegrass emergence then control will be good but if ryegrass emerges prior to axiom being activated then control will be poor axiom will also provide fair to good control of several problematic broadleaf weeds including wild radish and henbit axiom may be used as part of an herbicide resistance management program because it has an alternate mode of action for the control of ryegrass compared to typically used products such as axial hoelon osprey and powerflex those wanting to use axiom need to review the label very carefully regarding injury potential and use rates most georgia growers will be using 6 oz or maybe less in some environments of product per acre but again this should be determined from your soil type and label restrictions onions and sugar beets can be planted 18 months after applying axiom cotton 8 months and potato 1 month no plant back issues exist for corn or soybean see label for other crops fierce containing the active ingredients flumioxazin plus pyroxasulfone has obtained a section 24 c special local need label for georgia wheat this is a new tool to help georgia wheat producers but it must be used on a small scale until experience can be obtained as injury can occur in some environments wheat must be planted between 1 and 15 inches deep fierce cannot be applied to wheat that has been broadcast and shallow incorporated fierce at 15 oz of product per acre mixed with only water can be applied topically once 95 of the wheat is in the spike to 2leaf stage of growth rainfall or irrigation of inch must occur prior to ryegrass reaching in height good control of wild radish will also be achieved as long as it is less than inch at time of activation do not apply fierce to heavy sands or low organic matter soils as injury is expected hoelon containing the active ingredient diclofopmethyl can be applied in wheat to control annual ryegrass hoelon does not control broadleaf weeds wild garlic or annual bluegrass hoelon can be applied postemergence in any variety of wheat any time before the first node or joint develops up 25 to feekes stage 6 figure 1 timely application of hoelon to annual ryegrass is essential for good control best control is obtained when treating one to threeleaf ryegrass about 2 to 3 inches tall which usually occurs prior to christmas higher rates are required for larger ryegrass and even then control decreases better activity is obtained under warmer temperatures nighttime temperatures should be above 350 f for three days before and three days after application postemergence hoelon rates for ryegrass postemergence hoelon effectiveness ryegrass hoelon rate ryegrass percent growth stage pints per acre height control 1 to 3 leaves 133 2 inches 100 3 to 4 leaves 133 to 20 4 inches 80 90 5 leaves to 2 tillers 20 to 267 6 inches 50 the hoelon label allows for the addition of crop oil concentrate crop oil is usually not necessary and it may increase the risk of crop injury under stressful conditions however a crop oil can improve control under dry conditions or when treating large ryegrass hoelon should not be applied postemergence in nitrogen or tank mixed with other herbicides either of these situations can reduce ryegrass control additionally to avoid reduced ryegrass control do not apply 24d within five days of applying hoelon ryegrass resistant to hoelon is quite common throughout georgia prowl h 20 active ingredient pendimethalin at 15 to 25 pta can be applied postemergence to wheat as long as the wheat is between the 1st leaf stage and the flag leaf being visible figure 1 prowl does not control emerged weeds but can provide residual control of sensitive weed species if the herbicide is activated by rainfall or irrigation in a timely manner for ryegrass prowl can provide 50 to 80 control at 30 d after application as long as the prowl was activated prior to ryegrass germination research results on prowls ability to control broadleaf weeds like henbit chickweed etc is currently limited the prowl h 20 label allows for mixtures with any labeled postemergence wheat herbicide the two greatest uses for prowl h 20 might be the following first a mixture of prowl h 20 with a postemergence annual ryegrass herbicide in theory with this application the postemergence herbicide would control the emerged ryegrass and the prowl h 20 would provide residual control of germinating ryegrass for a couple of weeks however it is worth mentioning that most of the ryegrass seen at harvest is not ryegrass that emerged after postemergence herbicide treatment but rather is ryegrass that was not controlled with a postemergence herbicide because the ryegrass was too large or resistant when treated prowl h 20 will not help with this situation a second use for prowl h 20 in wheat would be in a situation where the wheat emerges while the ryegrass is late to emerge in this situation prowl h 20 applied over one leaf wheat and activated by rainfall or irrigation could provide control of that later emerging ryegrass 26 osprey active ingredient mesosulfuronmethyl is a postemergent herbicide applied at 475 oz per acre in wheat from emergence up to the jointing stage figure 1 for annual ryegrass control applications must be made between 1leaf and 2tillers if applied properly and timely osprey controls ryegrass very well and very consistently including hoelonresistant ryegrass as long as it is not alsresistant ryegrass osprey is a sulfonylureatype herbicide and works slowly symptoms appear three to four weeks after application but eight weeks may pass before ryegrass dies four hour rain fastness required an adjuvant is required with osprey the manufacturer is currently recommending a nonionic surfactant containing at least 80 surfaceactive agents plus an ammonium nitrogen source for wheat in georgia the nonionic surfactant should be used at a rate of 05 by volume 2 quarts per 100 gallons spray solution in addition to the nonionic surfactant also include 1 to 2 quarts per acre of urea ammonium nitrogen fertilizer 280 0 300 0 or 320 0 or ammonium sulfate fertilizer at 15 to 3 pounds per acre 210 024 apply osprey in 12 to 15 gallons of water per acre do not use liquid nitrogen as a carrier and do not apply osprey within 14 days of topdressing occasionally significant injury has been observed when wheat has been topdressed shortly after an osprey application separate osprey and 24d applications by at least 5 days osprey may be mixed with harmony extra to improve control of broadleaf weeds the label also allows a mixture with mcpa however antagonism reduced ryegrass control with ospreymcpa mixtures has been noted in several georgia research studies osprey will also provide good control of henbit wild radish and common chickweed if applied when these weeds are small 2 inch osprey is very effective on annual bluegrass but does not control little barley the rotational restriction following osprey application is 30 days for barley and sunflower 90 days for cotton peanut soybean rice lentils peas and dry beans 12 months for corn and 10 months for other crops resistance to osprey and powerflex is now common growers should rotate powerflex or osprey with alternative chemistries every year never treat the same piece of land more than once in a two year time period with either osprey or powerflex powerflex hl active ingredient pyroxsulam can be applied from the threeleaf stage until jointing figure 1 apply after the majority of the ryegrass has emerged but before it exceeds the twotiller stage which means most applications should occur prior to christmas the current formulation of powerflex hl should be a 1313 wdg where 20 oza is the appropriate rate applications should be made in 12 to 15 gallons per acre and include a crop oil concentrate at 1 to 125 vv 1 to 125 gal crop oil per 100 gal spray solution four hours is needed prior to the first rain in addition to ryegrass the powerflex hl label claims control of several broadleaf weeds including carolina geranium common chickweed hairy vetch wild mustard and suppression of 27 henbit the label does not mention wild radish but numerous georgia studies suggest excellent control of radish up to 8 inches in height table 13 for additional broadleaf control powerflex hl may be mixed with harmony extra do not mix with dicamba 24 d or mcpa also do not mix with or spray within 5 days of organophosphate insecticides do not fertilize with an independent liquid ammonium nitrogen application within 7 days before or after a powerflex application however the label allows for powerflex to be mixed in water nitrogen mixtures containing up to 50 liquid nitrogen 30 lb actual nitrogen per acre when powerflex is applied with nitrogen use a nonionic surfactant at 1 pt per 100 gallon 025 vv of solution instead of crop oil uga strongly recommends against mixing powerflex with nitrogen fertilizer as a carrier because of the potential for reduced ryegrass control powerflex is a sulfonylureatype herbicide and similar to other sulfonylureas powerflex works slowly symptoms appear three to four weeks after application with up to eight weeks passing before the ryegrass actually dies ryegrass resistance to powerflex and osprey are now common growers should rotate powerflex or osprey with alternative chemistry every year never treat the same piece of land more than once in a two year time period with either of these herbicides labeled rotational restrictions include 1 month for wheat and triticale 3 months for cotton soybean grain sorghum and sunflower 9 months for grasses including barley field corn millet oats popcorn seed corn sweet corn and for broadleaves including alfalfa canola chickpea dry bean field pea flax lentil mustard potato safflower and sugar beet all crops not listed have a 12 month rotational restriction zidua active ingredient pyroxasulfone can be applied as a delayed preemergence or early postemergence in wheat that is planted between 07 5 to 125 inches deep delayed preemergence applications can occur when 80 of the germinated wheat seeds have a shoot at least inch long up until spiking applications of 07 to 10 oza coarse soils are appropriate for most georgia fields while the rate can be increased to 125 oza on medium to fine soils do not irrigate fields treated with a delayed preemergence application until wheat spiking and do not apply delayed preemergence applications to broadcastseeded wheat early postemergence zidua applications can be applied to wheat at spiking up to the fourthtiller growth stage at a rate of 10 to 20 oza sequential applications may also be applied as long as the total use rate does not exceed 25 oza if zidua is activated prior to ryegrass emergence excellent control is expected however if ryegrass is up at time of zidua application then control of the emerged plants will likely be poor the label does allow mixtures with axial greatest potential for injury occurs when opencracked seed furrow allows herbicides to directly contact the seed when seed are planted too shallow or when seed are planted in a deep furrow that 28 allows herbicide concentration after a rainirrigation event during wheat germination herbicide resistance management herbicide resistance is a natural inherited ability of a plant to survive and reproduce following exposure to a dose of herbicide that normally controls that plant species resistant plants are not responsive to a particular herbicide because of a genetic change within the plant population herbicides do not create resistant plants resistant plants are naturally present in very low numbers repeated use of the same herbicide or those herbicides with the same mode of action may select for resistant plants in other words allow the resistant plants to become the predominant type present resistant weed populations are allowed to flourish as competition from susceptible species is eliminated by the herbicide treatment ryegrass with resistance to hoelon has been a problem in georgia for years osprey and powerfl exresistant ryegrass are now common because of repeated use of osprey andor powerflex during 2009 ryegrass with resistance to hoelon osprey and powerflex was confirmed and in 2011 numerous ryegrass populations with resistance to hoelon osprey axial and powerflex were confirmed one effective way to avoid or delay buildup of herbicideresistant weed populations is rotation of herbicides with different modes of action additionally integration of nonchemical controls such as crop rotations and cultural control methods including deep turning of the land can delay resistance evolution early detection of herbicideresistant weeds is important to limit their spread to other fields and farms currently not infested since some control failures are not due to weed resistance growers should eliminate other possible causes of poor herbicide performance before assuming they have resistance these causes include the following 1 improper herbicide choice or rate 2 poorimproper application 3 poor timing of application 4 unfavorable weather 5 later weed flushes 6 antagonism by other pesticides 7 time of day in which the herbicide was applied 8 weed covered by dirt during the planting process after eliminating possible causes for control failure then look for known indicators of resistance 1 poor performance on one species while other species are controlled well 2 product that normally controls a weed in question performs poorly under ideal conditions 3 poor control confined to localized spots in a field at least initially 4 within a species some plants are controlled well whereas others are not 5 field history of heavy use of herbicides with same mode of action not required but likely to increase the potential for resistance 29 liquid nitrogen tank mixes although several herbicides used in wheat may be mixed with liquid nitrogen see label of individual herbicides herbicide and nitrogen timing for wheat applications may not coincide for example nitrogen should be applied at full tiller and prior to jointing whereas herbicides should be applied when the weeds are small and the wheat will not be injured stretching the window for effective weed control to accommodate nitrogen fertilization may result in poor weed control and possibly greater wheat injury additionally nitrogen fertilizers should never be mixed with herbicides being applied to control annual ryegrass because of the strong potential for antagonism additional consid erations for notill wheat production in notill production systems weed control at planting is critical because many winter annual weeds such as chickweed henbit annual bluegrass and italian ryegrass are already established at planting time paraquat gramoxone etc or glyphosate may be applied after planting but before wheat emerges tables 16 and 17 for control of emerged weeds a burndown herbicide is recommended in every case of notill wheat production without a burndown application winter annuals can quickly get too large to control easily and can cause substantial yield reduction higher rates of preplant burndown herbicides may be needed for dense weed populations under drought or cool or cold growing conditions or for specific problem weeds just as is the case in all other crops wheat should be planted into fields free from weeds 24d mcpa axial hoelon powerflex osprey and prowl h20 harmony extra express and peak 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 101 105 11 one begin forms leaf stem first second

david buntin this chapter discusses the major insect pests of wheat insect pests can reduce both grain yield and quality of small grain crops in georgia historically the hessian fly aphids and cereal leaf beetle are the pests of significant economic importance aphids can directly damage wheat but are of concern mostly because they transmit a viral disease called barley yellow dwarf byd true armyworm and other insects also occasional ly damage cereal grain crops major insect pests aphids aphids are small softbodied insects that can be found in wheat anytime during the growing season the most common aphids found on wheat are the bird cherryoat aphid rice root aphid greenbug corn leaf aphid and english grain aphid the first four occur mostly in the fall and winter only the greenbug causes direct feeding damage that appears speckled brown and discolored with some leaf curling the other aphids usually do not cause obvious feeding damage the english grain aphid is mainly present in the spring and can reach large numbers on flag leaves and developing grain heads damage from this pest can reduce kernel size and low er grain test weight aphids are a serious pest of wheat because they also transmit a viral disease named barley yellow dwarf byd and a related disease called cereal yellow dwarf wheat and barley can be severely damaged but oats are most susceptible to this disease a new aphid sipha maydis has been found in the southeast on wheat which also can transmit byd but its impact on wheat production in georgia is not yet known byd is present in most fields in most years throughout georgia yield losses are sporadic but losses of 515 are common and can exceed 30 during severe epidemics infection can occur from seedling emergence through heading but yield loss is greatest when plants are infected as seedlings in the fall although all aphids can potentially transmit certain strains of the virus infections in the southeast are mostly associated with infestations of bird cherryoat aphid and rice root aphid planting date is the single most important management practice with early plantings having greater aphid numbers and greater byd incidence than late plantings for the most part beneficial insects such as lady beetles are helpful in reducing aphid numbers in the fall before frost and in the spring but they are not active during the winter when aphids can quickly increase to large numbers during warm periods systemic seed treatments are available for controlling aphids in the fall and winter and may reduce infection rates of byd these seed treatments are more effective in the northern half of the state but are only recommended when 1 grain yield potential is high 60 buacre 2 a field has a history of byd infection andor 3 early plantings will be made in the coastal plain region seed treatments have been inconsistent in control and are not recommended for routine aphid control a single welltimed insecticide application of the insecticide lambda cyhalothrin wa rrior ii silencer and similar products or gamma cyhalothrin declare also can control aphids reduce the incidence of byd and increase yields the best time for treatment in northern georgia usually is about 25 35 days after planting although an application in the winter until full tiller also may be beneficial in southern georgia the best treatment time usually 39 is at fulltiller stage in late january to mid february but scout fields for aphids at 25 35 days after planting and during warm periods in january to determine if an insecticide application is needed a lambda cyhalothrin or gamma cyhalothrin treatment at full tiller can be applied with topdre ss nitrogen two new insecticides sivanto prime and transform wg also will provide useful control but its effect on byd infection has not determined op insecticides such as dimethoate also will control aphids but are not effective in preventing barley yellow dwarf infection to sample aphids inspect plants in 12 inches of row in fall and 6 inches of row in winter in spring inspect 10 grain heads flag leaf per sample count all aphids on both the flag leaf and head for making control decisions sample plants at 5 to 10 locations per field treat when populations reach or exceed the following thresholds seedlings 1 bird cherryoat aphids per row foot or 10 greenbugs per row foot 2 or more tillers per plant 6 aphids per row foot stem elongation to just before flag leaf emergence 2 aphids per stem flag leaf emergence 5 aphids per flag leaf heading emergence to early dough stage 10 aphids per head do not treat for aphids after middough stage hessian fly the hessian fly mayetiola destructor can cause severe damage to wheat production throughout the southern united states wheat is the primary host of the hessian fly but the insect also will damage triticale barley and rye also may be infested but damage normally is very limited hessian fly does not attack oats little barley is the only important noncrop host in georgia adult hessian flies are small black flies about the size of a mosquito adults live about two days and females lay about 200 eggs in the grooves of the upper side of the wheat leaves eggs are orangered 132 inch long and hatch in 3 to 5 days young reddish larvae move along a leaf groove to the leaf sheath and then move between the leaf sheath and stem where they feed on the stem above the leaf base maggots become white after molting and appear greenish white when full grown once larvae move to the stem base they are protected from weather extremes and foliarapplied insecticides maggots suck sap and stunt tillers presumably by injecting a toxin into the plant infested jointed stems are shortened and weakened at the joint where feeding occurs grain filling of infested stems is reduced and damaged stems may lodge before harvest generally three generations occur in the piedmont region and four generations occur in the coastal plain region of georgia the fall and winter generations stunt and kill seedling plants and vegetative tillers the spring generation infests jointed stems during head emergence and grain filling yield losses usually occur when fall tiller infestations exceed 8 of tillers and when spring stem infestations exceed 15 of stems the hessian fly is a cool season insect and is dormant over the summer in wheat stubble as a puparia which is sometimes called a flaxseed adults begin to emerge about september 1 since wheat is not yet planted the first generation develops entirely in volunteer small grains and little barley thus reduced tillage lack of crop rotation wheat after wheat and lack of 40 volunteer wheat control in summer crops enhance problems with hessian fly in autumn planting a hessian flyresistant variety is the most effective way to control hessian fly varieties in the georgia state wheat variety trials are evaluated for hessian fly resistance each year and these ratings also are available in the small grain performance tests bulletin the next table provides a list of varieties with good fair and poor resistance to hessian fly in georgia but also check the characteristics of recommended

such as gaucho cruiser or nipsit inside when applied at a high rate see table 20 will suppress fall infestations but will not prevent hessian fly infestation in winter or spring in february through midmarch with a properly timed foliar application of lambda cyhalothrin also may suppress spring infestation but consistent control is difficult this application must be applied while adults are active and eggs are being laid so sampling of eggs on leaves is needed for proper timing cereal leaf beetle cereal leaf beetle oulema melanopus was first discovered in northwest georgia in 1989 the insect is spreading southward and now occurs throughout the mountain and piedmont regions and in most of the upper coastal plain region larvae feed on many grasses including oats wheat barley rye orchard grass and annual ryegrass but the insect is a problem mostly on oats and wheat adult beetles are 5 mm long and blueblack with a reddish thorax neck and legs larvae are yellowwhite and up to 6 mm long but appear shiny and black because they are covered with fecal material adults and larvae defoliate or skeletonize long narrow sections of the flag and upper leaves adults are present in wheat during march and april when they mate and lay eggs larvae are present during wheat head emergence through 41 dough stage there is one generation per year newlyemerged adults over summer and overwinter in fence rows and wooded areas these adults will feed on green grasses in adjacent fields such as corn sorghum and crabgrass before moving to oversummering sites corn planted next to whe at fields can be damaged by the beetles although damage to corn usually is confined to field margins cereal leaf beetle can be effectively controlled by one application of an insecticide to foliage fields should be scouted by counting the number of larvae and adults on 10 stalks at 6 to 10 locations per field treatment should be considered when populations exceed 1 larva per 4 stems most insecticides should be applied after most eggs have hatched but before larval damage becomes extensive tank mixing with a foliar fungicide at heading time is usually feasible fall armyworm fall armyworm looks much like other armyworm species it is brown to black in color with an invert y on its head and four dots spaced in a square on the upper side last abdominal segment fall armyworms cannot tolerate freezing temperatures and die out in georgia each fall the moths are migratory and fly up from southern florida each spring there are several generations and in outbreak years they heavily infest and damage pastures grasses in late summer and the fall in these year fall armyworm also may infest seedling cereal grains especially fields planted early for grazing if present larvae can complete destroy a seedling stand of cereal grains field should be scouting soon after planting and an insecticide used if larvae are present and damage is occurring true armyworm the true armyworm looks much like other armyworm species it is brown to black in color larvae have three orange white and brown stripes running the length of each side the larvae will also have a narrow broken stripe down the center of its back wheat fields should be checked for the presence of true armyworms when wheat is heading usually in march and early april two weeks later in north georgia armyworms generally are active at night and rest during day under plant residue at the base of stems armyworms chew large irregular holes in leaves generally from the bottom up but may climb stems and cut grain heads off the plant very large infestation sometimes will march in large numbers out of defoliated wheat fields to continue feeding on crops in nearby fields treatment should be considered if 4 or more worms per square foot are found before pollenshed stage and if 8 or more worms per square foot are found after pollenshed stage insecticides listed are effective but coverage of dense foliar and lodged plants sometimes makes control difficult stink bugs wheat is often infested with stink bugs in spring during grain fill the brown and southern green stink bugs may reproduce and have a complete generation in wheat before harvest rice stink bug adults also are common in wheat as wheat dries down stink bug adults will disperse to nearby summer crops such as corn and vegetable crops stink bugs almost never require control in wheat treat if 1 or more bugs per square foot are present at milk stage treatment is not needed in the dough stage except to prevent dispersal to adjacent summer crops as wheat matures however stink bugs are highly mobile and in most cases it is best to scout and treat adjacent crops such as corn and vegetables when stink bugs move into and reach threshold levels in those summer crops 42 sampling for insect pests wheat should be scouted for aphids cereal leaf beetle and secondary pests scout the entire field insects tend to clump and thus an examination of the whole field should be made fields should be inspected soon after planting to verify timely emergence if emergence is poor the field should be checked for soilinhabiting insects such fall armyworm before replanting after stand establishment scout fields for aphids at 4 critical times 25 45 days after planting warm periods in january fulltiller in midfebruary and boot stage to head emergence the first three periods are intended to control byd infection and some direct aphid damage the last period is to prevent damage by grain aphids armyworms and cereal leaf beetle to sample aphids inspect plants in 12 inches of row in fall and 6 inches of row in winter in spring inspect 10 grain heads flag leaf per sample sample plants at 8 to 16 locations per field treat according to thresholds listed for aphids inspect fields for cereal leaf beetle adults and larvae weekly for several weeks beginning at boot stage count the number of larvae and adults on 10 stalks at 6 to 10 locations per field no other insect pest justifies routine sampling in wheat except possibly inspecting fields for armyworms during a boot stage while sampling for aphids and cereal leaf beetle insecticides except for the hessian fly most other insect pests can be controlled by applying foliar insecticides when population densities exceed economic thresholds table 19 granular insecticides at planting such as thimet phorate 20g are no t registered for use on wheat systemic se ed treatments such as gaucho 600 cruiser 5fs or nipsit inside may control aphids suppress byd infection and at high rates control hessian

recommendations see table 20 and the most recent edition of the georgia pest management handbook commercial edition httpwwwcaesugaedudepartmentsentomologyextensionpestmanagementhandbookhtml summary of management practices for insect pest control 1 avoid continuous planting of wheat in the same field including wheat as a cover crop 2 control volunteer wheat 3 plow fields to bury wheat debris burning wheat stubble alone is not effective without tillage 4 do not plant wheat for grain before the recommended planting date for your area 5 plant rye oats or ryegrass instead of wheat for grazing 6 select a hessian fly resistant variety that is adapted to your area 7 on hessian fly susceptible varieties consider using a systemic seed treatment if the field has a history of hessian fly damage is reduced tillage or if planting before the recommended planting date 8 scout wheat periodically for aphids true armyworms and cereal leaf beetles apply a foliar insecticide if numbers exceed treatment

martinezespinoza the most effective and economical method to control diseases of wheat is to plant disease resistant varieties resistance is the primary means to manage foliar diseases which cause the greatest yield reduction each year however few recommended varieties have good or high resistance to all the major foliar diseases in addition populations of fungi causing leaf rust and powdery mildew are constantly changing there are numerous strains or races of these fungi when a new variety is released it is usually resistant to the most commonly occurring races of the fungi prevalent at that time the race population can change rapidly certain individual races or new races may become more common if a variety is not resistant to these races of the fungus it can become severely diseased this may happen as quickly as a year after the release of a new variety varietal recommendations are modified each year often as a result of changes in disease susceptibility refer to the most recent information about the best varieties to grow in this guide and in the annual variety performance bulletin located at httpwwwswvtugaedusmallhtml weather conditions during the winter and spring can have a major effect on the incidence and severity of disease table 22 if the winter and spring are cool andor dry leaf diseases will usually be of little or no significance regardless of a varietys resistance a warm wet winter and spring are favorable for infection by diseasecausing fungi this results in more severe disease new fungal races also increase more rapidly under such conditions the combination of low resistance and warmer than normal winters and springs are favorable for severe powdery mildew leaf rust and stagonospora nodorum leaf and glume blotch the three most important fungal diseases stagonospora nodorum was formerly named septoria nodorum these conditions lead to an increased use of foliar fungicides to control diseases on susceptible varieties seedborne and soilborne diseases are controlled primarily by seed treatment and crop rotation resistance is generally not available for these diseases following planting and fertility management recommendations all contribute to successful disease management for these and other diseases among the diseases of wheat viruses are often the most difficult to control three virus diseases occur on wheat in georgia soilborne mosaic wheat spindle streak mosaic and barley yellow dwarf most varieties have good tolerance to soilborne mosaic and wheat spindle streak tolerance or resistance to barley yellow dwarf is fair to low for most varieties historically fusarium head blight f hb infections have been low in georgia however fhb incidence and severity has been high throughout the state over the last three years 20142016 fhb also called scab is a devastating and dangerous disease of wheat and barley with worldwide distribution the disease causes yield loss lowtest weights low seed germination and contamination of grain with mycotoxins a vomitoxin called deoxynivalenol don is considered the primary mycotoxin associated with fhb this mycotoxin is subject to regulatory limits by the us food and drug administration fda in the 2016 2017 season fhb incidence throughout the state was lower than previous years leaf diseases powdery mildew this disease may occur on any above ground plant part but it is usually most prevalent on the upper surface of the lower leaves the conspicuous white to gray patches of fungus appear early in the season when powdery mildew is severe the entire leaf turns yellow and dies black sporeproducing structures develop in older lesions dense stands high nitrogen fertility and rapid growth increase susceptibility under such conditions a variety listed as having good resistance may become heavily infected as the stem elongates and temperatures increase conditions become less favorable for powdery mildew this disease has the least effect on yields of any of the three diseases 50 discussed in this guide on all but the most susceptible varieties powdery mildew confined to the lower leaves has little or no effect on yield fungicides should not be applied until flag leaf emergence unless a variety is very susceptible if fungicide is applied too early the plant will not be protected during the latter half of the grainfilling period a complete description diagnosis and management is now available httpextensionugaedupublicationsdetailcfmnumberc1059 circular 1059 leaf rust reddishbrown pustules develop on leaves and sheaths these pustules are filled with spores of the fungus rubbing an infected leaf will leave rusty colored areas on your fingers rust pustules may be very tiny barely large enough to see with the naked eye to 18 inch in length generally varieties with higher levels of resistance will have smaller pustules than varieties with lower levels of resistance varieties with poor resistance will also have larger yellow halos around the pustules leaf rust has the greatest effect on yield of the diseases discussed here because it develops rapidly during favorable weather a complete description diagnosis and management is now available httpextensionugaedupublicationsdetailcfmnumberc1060 circular 1060 stripe rust also known as yellow rust pustules coalesce to produce long yellow stripes between veins of the leaf and sheath small yellow linear lesions occur on floral bracts these pustules are filled with spores of the fungus in georgia the disease appears in late february early march during cool overcast and wet weather stripe rust occurs well before leaf rust stripe rust is an emerging disease in georgia and has been seen for two of the last three years stripe rust can have a potentially devastating effect on yield chemical options are available to control stripe rust however selection of fungicide should be made judiciously genetic resistance to stripe rust should be the best way to manage the disease according to state breeders there are several varieties or breeding lines than have higher levels of resistance to the disease work is in progress to release newer varieties with resistance to stripe rust a complete description diagnosis and management is now available at httpextensionugaedupublicationsdetailhtmlnumberc960 circular 960 leaf and glume blotch lesions spots are initially watersoaked and then become dry yellow and finally brown lesions are generally oblong sometimes containing small black spore producing structures called pycnidia the lesions are often surrounded by a yellow halo lower leaves are generally more heavily infected with lesions joining together to cause entire leaves to turn brown and die if pycnidia are present on lower leaves when the uppermost leaf and the head begin to emerge infective spores will move to the top of the plant in splashing rain even after a brief shower symptoms may not appear for 1015 days on the top leaves or glumes on the head by the time lesions are seen on the head it is too late for effective fungicide use therefore it is important to examine the lower leaves for lesions when making decisions about fungicide application not just the top leaves lesions are first tan or brown on the upper portion of the glume while the lower part remains green as the head matures it becomes purplish to black in appearance from glume blotch leaf and glume blotch can reduce yield as much as 20 and reduce test weight due to grain shriveling even when disease severity is low barley yellow dwarf barley yellow dwarf virus bydv is probably the most widely distributed virus in wheat it is estimated to reduce yields by 5 to 25 each year the symptoms are variable and resemble nutritional problems or frost damage usually the discoloration is characterized by various shades of yellow or reddening from the tips to the base and from the leaf margin to the midribs of the leaves some varieties have more yellow symptoms whereas others have red to purple discoloration when infection begins early in the season after heading the uppermost leaf is often very upright severe infection usually causes some stunting and reduction in numbers of seeds per head bydv is transmitted by several aphid species aphids acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants for very short periods and then move to other uninfected plants infection can occur any time when viruliferous aphids multiply and migrate in fields crop rotation is less effective for barley yellow dwarf because aphids can transmit 51 the virus between fields and many grasses on which the aphids feed also harbor the virus barley yellow dwarf can cause severe losses in many georgia fields most often following a mild fall and winter which allows aphids to be active and transmit the virus early in plant development bydv is present in nearly all fields each year disease severity depends on aphid populations and the proportion of aphids that can transmit the virus control of volunteer wheat and grassy weeds during the summer and along the edges of fields may slow initial infection planting during the latter part of the recommended period can delay fall infection resistant varieties and insecticide application to control aphids can reduce damage from barley yellow dwarf see insect management table 22 optimum temperature and moisture for the major diseases affecting

favorable for powdery mildew fungal development seedborne and soilborne diseases seedling blights several fungal pathogens infect the seed as it matures particularly when rains are frequent during seed development seed quality is reduced significantly and germination is often problematic soil temperatures which are higher early in the fall also favor infection of the ungerminated seed and tissues of the germinating seedling by several species of soilborne pythium the combination of infection by both seedborne and soilborne fungi can result in severe pre and post emergence damping off the result may be a substantially reduced stand that grows slowly or it may be necessary to replant seedling blights can be reduced by planting goodquality seed and by the use of fungicidetreated seed table 23 smut diseases there are two smut diseases that affect wheat in georgia they usually cause only minor problems but they can increase rapidly and cause serious losses if not controlled loose smut causes the tissues in the head to be replaced by masses of powdery spores the fungus spores invade the embryo of the developing seed and the fungus survives there until the seed germinates common bunt or stinking smut occurs rarely but it can cause complete loss of a crop the tissues of the head remain intact but the seed is destroyed the masses of smut spores are in bunt balls which are held in the seed coat of the grain stinking smut gets its name from the foul odor it produces that is similar to rotting fish the bunt balls are easily ruptured during harvest and millions of spores are deposited on the surface of healthy seeds spores germinate and invade the germinating seedling and then the fungus grows systemically like loose smut smut spores are not toxic to animals or humans these smut pathogens are only transmitted by seed planting certified seed is an effective method to control smut diseases because seed fields are carefully inspected seed treatment with systemic fungicides is an inexpensive way to achieve nearly complete control of loose smut and common bunt table 23 52 table 23 seed treatment fungicides for control of seedborne and soilborne diseases of

takeall root and crown rot the fungus responsible for this disease builds up in the soil when wheat is planted in the same field two or more years roots are damaged progressively during the winter and early spring shortly after heading infected plants wilt and die due to poor water movement from the rotted roots to the stems the crown and lower stem turn black and plants are easily pulled from the soil areas of dead plants are circular or follow tillage patterns indicating movement of infested crop debris takeall is reduced by rotation with oats fallow or other noncereal winter crops such as canola rotation with barley rye or triticale maintains the fungus in roots of these crops although they may not exhibit symptoms as severe as on wheat sorghum as a summer crop will reduce the disease in a subsequent wheat crop whereas soybeans favor takeall other control measures include planting near the end of the recommended period to reduce fall infection and avoiding soil ph above 65 soilborne mosaic and spindle streak mosaic the symptoms of soilborne mosaic range from mild green to a prominent yellow leaf mosaic plants may be stunted or rosette in shape symptoms are usually seen in late winter and early spring new leaves may be mottled or exhibit streaks or flecking wheat spindle streak mosaic virus causes stunting and poor growth with yellow mottling and numerous elongated streaks on leaves leaf streaks are usually a light green to yellow the discontinuous streaks 54 run parallel to the leaf veins and taper to form a spindle shape both viruses are transmitted by a fungus which survives in the soil and transmits the virus into the wheat roots these diseases are typically a problem when soils remain wet during the late fall and winter spindle streak mosaic and soilborne mosaic are most common in fields planted to wheat for two or more years both viruses may occur together and symptoms may intermingle crop rotation is an effective control method other diseases fusarium head blight fhb or head scab fusarium head blight is caused by the pathogen fusarium spp teleomorphs gibberella spp and microdochium nivale severe infections of fusarium head blight have been registered in 2014 2015 and 2016 in georgia fhb is a devastating and dangerous disease of wheat and barley with worldwide distribution the disease causes yield loss lowtest weights low seed germination and contamination of grain with mycotoxins a vomitoxin called deoxynivalenol don is considered the primary mycotoxin associated with fhb this mycotoxin is subject to regulatory limits by the us food and drug administration fda the fungus requires warm 7886 f consistently humidwet weather coinciding with wheat at flowering stages for infection to occur fusarium conidia andor ascospores infection are most common at wheat anthesis fusarium head blight is best recognized on emerged immature heads where one or more or the entire head appears prematurely bleached see image to right usually a pinkishorange mycelium is present which will develop dark fruiting bodies perithecia diseased bleached spikelets are sterile or contain shriveleddiscolored seed usually with a tint of pink or orange for control avoid rotation with other cereal crops specifically corn fusarium graminearum also causes ear and stalk on corn or sorghum for more information on fhb visit httpwwwscabusaorg for fhb risk and or prediction information visit httpwwwwheatscabpsuedu a complete description diagnosis and management is now available at httpextensionugaedupublicationsdetailcfmnumberc1066 circular 1066 fungicide use the decision about whether or not to use a fungicide needs to be made carefully fungicides do not increase yield they only help preserve yield and test weight if yield potential is low or there is no disease present at the critical time for fungicide application or conditions are not favorable for disease there will be little benefit from fungicide application if the price of wheat is low there will be less profit from the use of fungicides for these reasons a decision guide has been developed to help you determine if fungicides will be beneficial this guide makes no guarantee for an economic return on the fungicide investment it will simply allow you to determine if fungicide treatment might help maintain yields to use this guide effectively you must scout your wheat fields and be able to recognize the three major foliage diseases likely to reduce yields consult the uga extension publications plant pathology section at httpextensionugaedupublicationshtml or the field crops section of the uga plant pathology extension site httpwwwcaesugaedudepartmentsplantpathologyextensioneducational materialsplantdiseaselibraryhtml for information on these and other wheat diseases some fungicide manufacturers have a color booklet on small grain diseases which is helpful in disease identification begin scouting soon after the plants tiller and the stem begins to elongate the leaves of plants should be observed at least once per week when jointing begins inspect plants twice each week from the time the flag uppermost leaf begins to emerge until flowering is complete this is the most critical time to consider fungicide application inspect all the leaves especially the lower leaves early in the season the lowest leaves may have symptoms while the younger upper leaves do not symptoms on the lower leaves are a good indication that the upper leaves will become infected especially if rain or heavy dews occur during the next several weeks because disease symptoms may not appear until 712 days after infection begins upper leaves that appear healthy may already be infected fungicides can only be effective when you carefully select the fungicide with good activity against the diseases present table 24 they should be applied at the correct rate and time according to the label 55 fungicides should be applied with enough water to get good coverage 57 galacre for aerial and 2030 galacre for ground application use of a spreadersticker will help improve leaf retention and fungicide performance when applying fungicides always read the label and comply with the instructions and restrictions listed generally the most effective time to apply fungicides is from flag leaf emergence to completion of heading but be certain to follow any label restrictions concerning time of application the number of applications and total amount of fungicide that can be applied per season infectious fungi sometimes develop resistance to particular fungicides especially when a product is used repeatedly without alternating with chemically unrelated fungicides when fungicide resistance develops there is no value in increasing rates shortening intervals between sprays or using other fungicides with similar modes of action several general strategies are recommended to minimize the risk of fungicide resistance first dont rely on fungicides alone for disease control avoid using wheat varieties that are highly susceptible to common diseases follow good disease management practices to reduce the possibility of fungicide resistance limit the number of times atrisk fungicides are used during a growing season alternate atrisk fungicides with different fungicide groups these are general principles that can help to reduce but not eliminate risk a fungicideresistant pathogen population can still develop when these principles are practiced table 24 fungicides for wheat foliar diseases disease chemical and formulation rate product per acre remarks and precautions

planted area yields are projected slightly up in 2017 increasing from 46 to 47 bushels per acre wheat prices continued to fall for the fifth year in a row the 2016 marketing year crop average is estimated at 405 per bushel compared to 4 60 and 535 per bushel for the 2015 and 2014 crops respectively prices for 2017 are looking to be just slightly better moving back towards 2014 prices but not quite reaching that level united states total wheat acreage planted in the us is estimated to fall 8 2 percent to 46 million acres for 2017 harvested acreage also is projected to decrease over 6 million acres to 376 million ac res winter wheat acreage is projected to drop 96 percent to 32 7 million acres in 2017 the us average winter wheat yield is estimated to drop from a record high 553 bushels per acre in 2016 to 502 bushels per acre in 2017 seventyseven percent of the winter wheat planted was harvested the us all wheat production is projected at 17 billion bushels of which 13 billion bushels are winter wheat both significant decreases in production compared to last year meanwhile total us soft red winter srw production fell 3 9 percent to 345 2 million bushels in 2016 and is projected to fall another 154 percent to 292156 in 2017 the july 2018 chicago futures price for wheat was around 5 per bushel in the fall of 2016 and while there was a spike in july 2017 to 6 per bushel there has been a steep decline since back to 500 monthly srw wheat price s dropped be low 4 per bushel in the late 2016 but have since rebounded to around 450 per bushel by mid2017 supply georgia georgia planted acres dropped again in the 2017 to 160 000 acres while harvested acres dropped 36 percent to 70000 acres the crop was far below the tenyear average crop of 280000 acres planted and 210200 acres harvested while the average yield increased 1 bushel per acre from the prior year to 47 bushels per acre this too was below the tenyear average of 49 bushels per acre producers were slightly ahead of the 5year average harvest rate at the end of may with almost all harvest completed by the end of june total production in georgia in 2017 dropped by 35 percent to 329 million bushels this level of production represents a 848 percent decrease from the recent high in 2013 and a 708 percent decline from 2014 the figure below shows the number of acres planted and harvested for georgia wheat as well as the annual yield for 2000 2017 59united states winter wheat for 201718 the soft red winter wheat production is projected to decrease by 53 million bushels to 292 million bushels well below hard red winter wheat and just 17 percent of all wheat total winter wheat acreage is estimated in 2017 to be down 34 million acres to 327 million planted acres with yields back down from record levels production of all winter wheat is projected to decrease by 24 per cent to 13 billion bushels united states all wheat total us wheat production decreased in 2017 with a drop in acreage and a decrease in yields total supply has dropped with the decline in production however there is still a very substantial buildup of stocks total production of all us wheat for 2016 17 is down 25 percent to 17 billion this level of production is the lowest since 2002 the carryover us wheat supply grew in 201617 to reach 12 billion bushels by the end of the marketing year with the decreased production estimated in 201718 ending stocks will drop but are still forecast to be above most recent years the figure below shows the total supply for us wheat including beginnings stocks and production for 20002017 note that imports are not included 60world wheat the 201617 global wheat production set a record of 7533 million tons while projections are slightly down from that record for 201718 total world wheat production is forecast to be 7449 million tons and has recently been revised upwards in particular russia is projecting a record 81millionton crop based on very favorable weather and updated harvest numbers that have exceeded initial optimistic yield expectations wheat production however is lower in australia a combination of bad weather in various parts of australia have affected the crop which is projected to decrease 11 million tons from the record crop produced last year the european union crop is projected to be up about 4 million tons after having dropped 15 million tons from the prior year the figure below shows the world wheat production and disappearance from 2000201 7 also included is the world stocks touse ratio showing 2017 at record levels having increased every year for five years in a row 61 disappearance close to record global wheat production is projected for 201718 and foreign domestic wheat use is projected to stay stable at 737 million metric tons total use of all wheat in the us increased in 201617 to 2 219 million bushels projections for 2017 18 however show a slight decline to 2141 million bushels the decrease is expected to mainly be in exports as a result of increased global competition recent hurricanes in the gulf coast region have also caused transportation issues for exports these are expected to be only temporary and should have no lasting impacts on export projections other uses remain stable or slightly increasing the percentage breakdown of major us wheat use includes food use 444 percent exports 45 5 percent feed and residual use 7 percent and seed use 31 percent total use of soft red winter wheat is projected to be 307 million bushels in 201718 this represents a 4 percent decrease from the 320 million bushels in 201617 the decrease is attributed to a 18 5 percent decrease in feed and residual use food use is projected to stay the same while exports are expected to drop 1 8 percent the percentage breakdown of major us soft red winter wheat use includes food use 48 9 percent exports 29 3 percent feed and residual use 179 percent and seed use 39 percent the figure below displays the total supply and major category use for us soft red winter wheat from 20002017 62 price projections prices for all wheat in the us have been on a steady decline in recent years falling almost 1 per bushel each of the last four years the marketing year annual price in 201617 averaged 3 89 per bushel the lowest price since 2005 since mid201617 marketing year the price of all wheat has started to increase with the
