chapter 8 agriculture 81 background with the growth of indian economy the share of agriculture in gdp has declined over the years and even today productivity of some agricultural products is lower compared to countries like usa china the growth in indian agricultural sector has had its moments of glory nonetheless green r evolution pioneering work by agriculture scientists and the efforts of farmers popularly known as the green revolution had helped achieve a breakthrough in the agriculture sector in the 1960 has been the major success story of free india the nation that was frequently plagued by famines and chronic food shortage before green revolution today faces surplus from a food grain production around 55 million tons at the time of independence we now boost of production of about 260 million tons of food grain unlike developed nations agriculture still remains the backbone of our country 82 significance of agriculture sector the agriculture sector occupies centre stage in indian economy embodying three thrust areas as 1 to promote inclusive growth 2 to enhance rural income and 3 to sustain food security it accounts for nearly 14 of gdp and exports and supports half o f the countrys population as its principal source of income as per census 2011 the total number of agricultural cultivators and agricultural labourers increased from 234 million in 2001 to 263 million in 2011 the share of agri exports in total exports increased from 13 08 in 2012 13 to 1417 rs 2 68000 cr in 2013 14 a record level 83 historical growth trends in agriculture 1 indian agriculture has witnessed wide variations in growth performance during a span of six decades after independence the variability was particularly pronounced due to the subsistence nature of farming in india and the sectors heavy dependence on monsoon and other climatic parameters in the initial years after the inception of planne d development it was the green revolution technologies that fired up growth in the sector for nearly three decades the impact of green revolution tapered off gradually towards the later years of the last century economic reforms initiated in early nineties had a significant impact on agricultural sector primarily due to the opening up of economy to external competition liberalization of trade and deregulation of input and other subsectors to overcome difficulties in identifying structural breaks or secular acceleration etc due to inter year fluctuations and to capture the effects of major changes in technologies and policies on the sector in various phases an analy sis based on decadal trend growth rates was carried out 1 the gdp agriculture series 1950 51 to 201011 was first smoothened by taking 2 year moving averages to remove the effects of abrupt weather variations and other shocks further trend growth rat es were estimated by fitting semi log trend to the smoothened data fi ve distinct phases of growth were identified i phase i pre green revolution period 1950 51 to 196768 ii phase ii early green revolution period 196869 to 198586 iii ph ase iii period of wider dissemination 198687 to 199697 iv phase iv post reform

parappurathu national centre for agricultural economics and policy research new delhi 84 the pre green revolution period 1950 51 to 1967 68 was characterized by steep decline in growth in gdp agriculture with decadal growth rates found to plummet sharply from 278 per cent to 106 per cent between the period 1950 51 and 1967 68 the green r evolution was kick started from the year 1966 and the effects of adoption of superior technology and institutional reforms were found to manifest from 1968 69 onwards the subsequent period is classified as early green revolution period and a visible rever sal of growth in gdp agriculture was observed the decadal growth rate reached near 3 per cent by the decade ending with 1985 86 the period of wider dissemination of technology was characterized by sustained growth in the sector for over a decade peaking at the year 1996 97 the deceleration of growth was started from 1997 98 onwards and a clear indication of slumping of the agricultural sector was visible till the year 2005 06 this slump is widely perceived as an outcome of substantial diversion of resources away from agriculture to other sectors of the economy however a significant recovery of growth was observed in the last few years that has pushed the decadal growth rates above 3 per cent in nutshell the growth series reflects sharp deceleration of the agricultural sector in the post reforms period and an unambiguous turnaround in the last five years which also happens to be the 11th five year plan period trend growth rates in gdp of various sub sectors in india at 1999

inter year fluctuationin contrast to two year averages used above the paper may be seen at httpwwwisecacin recent trends initiatives challenges decreasing size of operational holdings 85 the average size of holdings for all operational classes small marginal medium and large have declined over the years and the same for all classes put together has come down to 115 hectare in 2010 11 agriculture census 2010 11 from 282 hectare in 1970 71the average size of holdings was 123 ha in the last agriculture census of 2005 06 increasing pressure on agricultural land 86 increasing demand for industrialization urbanization housing and infrastructure is forcing conversion of agricultural land to non agricultural uses the scope for expansion of the area available for cultivation is limited this is reflected in d ecrease in net sown area on the whole from 143 million hectares in 1990 91 to 1399 million hectares in 201213 however the gross cropped area has gone up by 6 million hectare from 186 to 19 4 million hectare during the same period due to increase in the cropping intensity from 130 to 139 per cent diversification commercialization of agriculture 87 departing from the traditional subsistence nature of agriculture the farmers in the post green revolution scenario are increasingly growing crops with an eye on the market non remunerative or low yield crops are being replaced by nonfood crops that fetch higher remunerative prices and the farmers are increasingly resorting to horticulture floriculture sericulture viniculture apiculture and other similar activities a s a result of which area under food crops is declining in some areas specially in case of coarse grains organic farming is also p icking up due to increase in demands for healthy products shift towards high v alue agriculture 88 structural shift in consumption pattern away from cereals to high value agricultural commodities both in rural and urban areas has been observed in the last two decades this relatively strong and growing domestic demand for livestock products and fruits and vegetables in both rural and urban areas and increased trade in these commodities has spurre d a shift towards production of high value commodities in agriculture during the 2000s the growth rate in value of exports of rice sugar marine products tea etc declined while high value exports fruits and vegetables floriculture meat processed fruit juices grew by about 18 percent annually march towards ict revolution 89 since independence india has witnessed significant increase in foodgrain production green revolution oilseeds yellow revolution milk white revolution fish blue revolution and fruits and vegetables golden revolution now india is marching towards what is called as ict revolution in agriculture most of the earlier revolutions were with the single objective of increasing production the extensions activity was limited to providing physical inputs viz fertilizers seed pesticides among others however all this is undergoing a change the extension efforts are now directed towards providing farmers with the knowledge of the market conditions so as to enable them to decide what to produce how and how much to produce when and where to sell farmers can now also avail information regarding the weather conditions and decide their farm operations the use of gis is also being promoted in a big way growth in area production and yield 810 year 2013 14 was a an exceptionally good year for agriculture in india as several crops witnessed record production the production in the year thereafter ie 2014 15 declined across most crops except for some crops like sugarcane as per final estimates for 2013 14 total production of rice in the country was estimated at 1066 million tonnes which is a new rec ord production of wheat estimated at record 958 million tonnes was also higher than ever before the production of coarse cereals was estimated at 433 million tonnes which was also higher than the production during 2012 13total food grains production estimated at 265 million tonnes is also a record it is higher by about 8 million tonnes than the production during the year before total production of pulses and oilseeds estimated at record levels of 1925 million tonnes and 327 million tonnes respect ively are higher by 09 million tonnes and 18 million tonnes than their production levels during 2012 13 production of sugarcane during 2013 14 estimated at 35 2 million tonnes is higher by about 11 million tonnes than its production of 341 million tonnes during 2012 13 production of cotton estimated at 359 million bales of 170 kg each is also higher by about 17 million bales than its production of 342 million bales during 2012 13 811 as per fourth advance estimate in 201 415 production of food grains is expected to decline by about 47 compared to the previous year as india is likely to produce about 253 million tons of food grains a

small millets ground nuts rapeseed and mustard sunflower and mesta has witnessed a negative growth while the yields of all the major crops have recorded positive growth impressive rates of growth more than 4 percent per annum in production were observed in the case of wheat bajra maize coarse cereals gram tur total pulses groundnut sesamum s oyabean total oilseeds and cotton the increases in production in the case of wheat bajra maize groundnut and total oilseeds can mainly be attributed to increase in yields whereas the growth in production in the case of gram tur total pulses soyabean and cotton was driven by a combination of both expansion in area and increase in productivityyield a perusal of the rates of growth in yield reveals that most of the crops have recorded higher growth during the 11th plan than that during the 10th plan however sugarcane and rapeseed mustard soybean and cotton recorded lower rates of growth in yield during the 11th plan than that of the 10th plan growth in yields of sugarcane and rapeseed mustard suggest that their yields seem to have attained the plateau and need renewed research to boost their productivity levels all india growth rates of

to each and every agricultural field in the country c price stabilization fund for cereals and vegetables government has established a price stabilisation fund of rs500 crore in order to reduce price volatility in perishable agricultural commodities onions potatoes tomatoes etc d national agritech infra structure an agri tech infrastructure fund has been proposed to create a common e marketing platform for agri commodities in the agriculture produce marketing committees apmcs in the state as a first step towards creation of a national market 815 in order to keep up the momentum gained during the 11th plan and achieve the targeted growth rate of 4 during the 12th five year plan as also to ensure focused approach and to avoid overlap all the schemes of the department has been restructured into five missions viz national food security mission nfsm mission for integrated development of horticulture midh national mission on oil seeds and oil palm nmoop national mission for sustainable agriculture nmsa and national mission on agricultural extension technology nmaet four central sector schemes viz national crop insurance programme ncip integrated scheme on agri census

pilot schemes of modified national agricultural insurance sc heme mnais weather based crop insurance scheme wbcis and coconut palm insurance scheme cpis with some improvements for full fledged implementation from rabi 2013 14 season throughout the country nais was to be discontinued after implementation of nicp from rabi 2013 14 season however on the representations from states it has been continued during 2013 14 and 2014 15 the total funds released by government of india goi under various schemes for crop insurance till december 2014 are as follows 820 a range of area specific and crop specific interventions to boost productivity have been introduced by the government some of them are listed as under national food security mission the national food security mission is presently under i mplementation in 482 districts of 19 states of the country with a view to enhance the production of rice wheat and pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement restoring soil fertility and productivity creating employment opportunities and enhancing farm level economy to restore confidence of farmers during the 12th plan it is proposed to include coarse cereals as well in

labour increasing costs of inputs and uncertainties associated with pricesrealisation which impact the viability of farming are some of the formidable challenges the agriculture sector faces resource use efficiency to improve factor productivity and ensuring natural resources sustainability are necessary to reconcile the conflicting demands of farmers and consumer while the country is presently self sufficient in cereals it meets its domestic requirements for pulses and edible oils through imports the working group for the 12th five year plan has also projected that the deficit between the domestic demand and supply in the cases of pulses and edible oils would continue even by the end of the 12th plan despite the various efforts being made there is no technological breakthrough in pulses the yields are still hovering around 600 800 kg per hectare pulses continue to be grown by small and marginal farmers on marginal lands under rainfed conditions even though substantial increases have been made in the msp due to weak procurementprice support mechanism farmers response in terms of increase in acreage under pulses is lukewarm nearly half of our domestic requirement of edible oils is met through imports developing oil palm which have high oil contents on large track of lands suitable for its cultivation can bridge the gap between demand and supply of edible oils 822

system in india is a decentralized one w here the state governments state agricultural statistics authorities sasas to be more specific play a major role in collection and compilation of ag riculture statistics at the state level des m0 agriculture is the pivotal agency for such a compilation at all india level the other data gathering agencies involved are national sample survey office nsso state dess the estimate of crop production are based on area through field estimation and yield rate through crop cutting experiments 825 crop area statistics from the point of view of crop area statistics the states and union territories can be classified into three broad groups a states and union territories 18 in number which have been cadastrally surveyed and where area and land use statistics form a part of the land records maintained by the revenue agency referred to as temporarily settled states b kerala orissa and west bengal known as permanently settled states where there is no land revenue agency at the village level and crop area and land use statistics are collected through a scheme of sample surveys c part of assam hill districts arunachal pradesh manipur m eghalaya mizoram nagaland sikkim and tripura and the two union territories of andaman and nicobar islands and lakshadweep for which only conventional estimates are available 826 statistics of crop area are compiled with the help of the village revenue agency commonly known as patwari agency in the temporarily settled parts of the country and by specially appointed field staff in the permanently settled states under a scheme known as establishment of an agency for reporting agricultural statis tics earas conventional crop estimates for the states in third category are based on personal assessment of the village chowkidars the three categories of states and union territories account for eighty six nine and five per cent respectively of the total reporting area whereas about 7 per cent of total geographical area is not reported upon 827 in the states that have a patwari agency a complete enumeration of all fields survey numbers called girdawari is made in every village during each crop season to compile land use irrigation and crop area statistics in the states covered by earas the girdawari is limited to a random sample of 20 per cent villages of the state which are selected in such a way t hat during a period of five years the entire state is covered however in view of increasing range of functions assigned to patwaris in temporary settled states in order to improve the timeliness and quality of crop area statistics two schemes are in o peration since early seventies namely the timely reporting scheme trs and the scheme for improvement of crop statistics ics under the trs the patwari is required to complete the girdawari on a priority basis in a 20 per cent random sample of villages in such a way that the entire temporarily settled parts of the country are covered over a period of five years and to submit the village crop statements to higher authorities by a stipulated date for the preparation of advance estimates of the area under major crops under the ics scheme an independent agency of supervisors carries out a physical verification of the patwaris girdawari in a sub sample of the trs sample villages in a sub sample of earas sample villages the national sample survey organisation is responsible for the planning and operations of the ics and employs full time staff for field supervision it shares the fieldwork with the designated state agencies which carry out the field supervision in about half the number of sample villages 828 crop production statistics estimates of crop production are obtained by multiplying the area under crop and the yield rate the yield rate estimates are based on scientifically designed crop cutting experiments conducted under the general crop estimation survey gces the improvem ent of crop statistics ics scheme carries out a quality check on the field operations of gces under which around 30000 experiments are supervised by the ics staff at the harvesting stage one half by the assistant superintendents of the field operations division fod of nsso and the remaining half by the staff of the state agricultural statistics authority sasa terms definitions 829 classification of land data are taken from latest forestry statistics publication agriculture census or are estimated based on latest available year data received from the statesuts respectively the ninefold classification land uses are as under i forest area this includes all land classified either as forest under any legal enactment or administered as forest whether state owned or pr ivate and whether wooded or maintained as potential forest land the area of crops rose in the forest and grazing lands or areas open for grazing within the forests remain included under the forest area ii area un der non agricultural uses this includes all land occupied by buildings roads and railways or under water eg rivers and canals and other land put to uses other than agriculture iii barren and unculturable land this includes all land covered by mountains deserts etc land which cannot be brought under cultivation except at an exorbitant cost is classified as unculturable whether such land is in isolated blocks or within cultivated holdings iv permanent pasture and other grazing land this includes all grazing land whether it is permanent pasturemeadows or not village common grazing land is included under this category v land under miscellaneous tree crops etc this includes all cultivable land which is not included in net area sownbut is put to some agricultural use land under casurina trees thatching grasses bamboo bushes and other groves for fuel etc which are not included under orchards are classified under this category vi culturable waste land this includes land available for cultivation whether taken up or not taken up for cultivation once but not cultivated during the last five years or more in succession including the current year for some reason or the other such land may be either fallow or covered with shrubs and jungles which are not put to any use they may be accessible or inaccessible and may lie in isolated blocks or within cultivated holdings vii fallow lands other than current fallows this includes all land which was taken up for cultivation but is temporarily out of cultivation for a period of not less than one year and not more than five years fallow land has been split up into i current fallow land and ii other fallow land land lying fallow for a period of one year are included under current fallows those lying fallow for more than one year but less than five years are included under other fallow land while those fallow beyond a period of five years are included under culturable wastes or under miscellaneous tree crops and groves not included under net area sown as the case may be viii current fallows this represents cropped area which are kept fallow during the current year for example if any seeding area is not cropped against the same year it may be treated as c urrent fallow ix net area sown this represents the total area sown with crops and orchards area sowed more than once in the same year is counted only once area under crops the figures related to total cropped area are either estimated based on the latest available data received from statesuts or are based on advanceforecast estimates received from the statesuts gross cropped area this represents the total area sown once andor more than once in a particular year ie the area is counted as many times as there are sowings in year this total area is also known as total cropped area or total area sown area sown more than once this represents the areas on which crops cultivated more than once during the agricultural year this is obtained by deducting net area sown from gross cropped area irrigated area the figures used in this chapter related to irrigate area are either estimated based on the data for the latest available year received from the statesuts or are estimatedtaken from agricultur e census the area is assumed to be irrigated for cultivation through such sources as canals govt private tanks tube wells other wells and other sources it is divided into two categories as a net irrigated area it is the area irrigated through any source once in a year for a particular crop b total net un irrigated area it is the area arrived at by deducting the net irrigated area from net sown area gross irrigated area it is the total area under crops irrigated once andor more than once in a year it is counted as many times as the number of times the areas are cropped and irrigated in a year totalgross un irrigated area it is the area arrived at by deducting the gross irrigated area from the gross sown area average yield of crops average yields per hectare of principal crops have been obtained by dividing the total production by the corresponding total area under each crop all india and state average yield per hectare has generally been calculated on the basis of area and production figures rounded up to hundreds in the case of tea rubber and minor crops average yield has been calculated on the basis of area and production figures upto the unit place in the case of coffee yields per hectare relate to sowing or plucked area and in the case of rubber to tapped area references the state of indian agriculture 2012 13 department of agriculture
