conventional wisdom tells us that as an economy moves along the development path the importance of agriculture declines both in terms of employment and contribution to national income as measured by gross domestic product or gdp this process of structural transformation has received substantial treatment in the literature the diminishing share of agriculture has led scholars such as timmer 2009 to claim that we are headed to a world without agriculture wherein the shares of agriculture in both gdp and employment are less than 3 timmer 2009 also emphasises that in terms of labour productivity there is no discernible difference between the agriculture and nonagriculture sectors meaning that income gaps between the two groups are miniscule at best this paper first examines where india and individual states lie on this path put forward by timmer 2009 between the years 199394 to 201920 the findings are hardly surprising indias structural transformation is incomplete while the share of agriculture in gdp has been falling the share of agriculture in employment has not been falling at a commensurate pace this has created an imbalance between labour productivity in the agriculture sector vs labour productivity in the nonagriculture sectors for example at an allindia level in 201920 the share of agriculture in employment is 456 whereas the share of agriculture in gdp stood at 135 while some states are further along this path of structural transformation it has been found india still remains someway away from the canonical structural transformation path the work of timmer 2009 largely assumes that the conditions in which most present day developed countries such as the present oecd countries that have completed their transformation would continue to hold true for developing countries such as india it has so far been assumed that all economies follow the trajectory first laid out by lewis 1954 yet this path of structural transformation assumes certain preconditions first labour is pulled out of agriculture into more productive sectors of the economy leaving behind fewer farmers to work on larger farms this allows the productive capacity of the agriculture sector to rise both in terms of land productivity through intensification of inputs and labour productivity through mechanisation rising land availability per farmer is an important precursor to this process indeed raising agriculture productivity is seen as the precursor to the development process the paper then examines the challenges agriculture in india faces in raising productivity the mechanisms through which countries in the past have raised agriculture productivity are not necessarily true for india first the size of the average farm in india has been falling over time whereas in developed countries farms got bigger as labour migrated out of agriculture into urban areas while india has seen urban migration and a spillover of workers in agriculture to other sectors the pace has not been commensurate with that of conventional knowledge executive summarya new paradigm for indian agricultureviii executive summary raising irrigation coverage is another mechanism to increase productivity nearly half of indias cropped area remains rainfed informal credit especially to small and marginal farmers remains prevalent the literature has found a positive relationship between formal credit availability and agriculture growth nor have the best scientific practices permeated at the field level perhaps more important than the productivity enhancing challenges are the environmental challenges that the india faces in ensuring sustainable agriculture the current practices prevalent are causing serious environmental damage in terms of declining soil health depleting water tables greenhouse gas emissions etc analysis of data from the soil health card scheme shows the alarmingly low levels of soil organic carbon soc across india an important indicator of soil health imbalance in the use of fertilisers has been linked to declining soil health as per a study by the national academy of agricultural sciences naas 2018 this paper demonstrates the imbalance in fertiliser use at the statelevel sources of irrigation water have shifted from surface water channels such as canals to groundwater presenting administrative data on groundwater extraction this paper demonstrates the alarming level of water extraction in the most productive states based on these discussions the paper concludes that india faces the twin challenges of improving productivity but also doing it in an environmentally friendly manner which the current system of production is at odds with therefore prima facie these two goals may seem mutually exclusive diminishing marginal returns are now evident in the current system of production the canonical path of structural transformation is also not evident in the case of india as mentioned earlier the conditions in which the developed countries of today were able to transform themselves and the conditions which informed the work of timmer 2009 may not necessarily hold as this paper has shown dorin et al 2013 identified three other paths of structural transformation along with the path laid down by lewis 1954 and timmer 2009 apart from the canonical path termed the lewis path the other three are farmer developing path farmer excluding path and lewis trap path crucial in determining these paths is the labourincome ratio lir defined by dorin et al 2013 which is the ratio between the share of agriculture in gdp and in employment as the lir 1 this indicates a convergence between farm and nonfarm incomes if the lir 0 then there is divergence between the two in the lewis path the lir 1 as the number of farmers decreases but productivity rises this is the path taken by most oecd countries in the farmer developing path lir 1 as labour productivity in agriculture increases but the number of farmers also increases on the opposite we have the lewis trap where the income gap between the farm and nonfarm sectors widens and the agriculture workforce increases the final path identified is the farmer excluding path where the income gap between farm and nonfarm sectors widen and the number of farmers decreases the key contribution of this paper is that it identifies the path taken not just at the national level but also the state level the findings indicate that rather than on the lewis path of transformation as theory tells us india is on the lewis trap path individual states are either on the lewis trap path or the farmer excluding path only two northeastern states manipur and nagaland are found to be on a farmer developing path this indicates that indias path of structural transformation will continue to exacerbate inequalities while india has made significant strides in raising land productivity but shrinking land availability has meant that labour productivity has grown at a much slower pace than average labour productivity in the economy a new paradigm for indian agricultureix executive summary the paper then introduces the concept of agroecology as a potential solution to the supposed tradeoff between productivity and sustainability and also as a solution to a path of structural transformation where inequalities are not exacerbated altieri nicholls 2020 assert that there are five main areas through which agroecology can point a new way for agriculture reduced reliance on pesticides enriching biodiversity revitalising small farms creating alternative animal production systems and enhancing urban agriculture the paper then introduces natural farming being practised in some parts of india which is a chemicalfree method of farming evidence from recently conducted field studies on natural farming are presented showing that natural farming has the potential to reduce input costs and in many cases exceed the yield of conventional farming the paper also attempts to distil some policy implications from the discussion at the outset we note that these suggestions are an attempt to further policy discourse on this matter and in no way are finalised suggestions however they do represent promising areas of future research to further agroecological farming in india i introductiona new paradigm for indian agriculture2 introduction despite its declining share in gross domestic product gdp all across the world agriculture still remains an important policy priority for governments around the world this declining share of agriculture in national income and employment has been described as the structural transformation of an economy rural to urban migration and a decline in birth rates and mortality rates are other characteristics of this transformation herrendorf et al 2014 lewis 1954 pioneered the work on the structural transformation of an economy with his dualsector model he postulated that the capitalistic sector drew excess labour from the subsistence sector raising the wages of those entering the capitalistic sector johnston mellor 1961 term the decline of the agricultural sector as the general transformation model they note that the important precursors to a structural transformation are an income elasticity of food of less than one and the ability to expand agricultural production with a declining workforce the authors reiterate the conclusion from lewis 1954 that overall economic growth demands a structural transformation of an economy one which sees a declining role of the agriculture sector this has led many to claim that this process of structural transformation will lead to a world without agriculture timmer 2009 as today in oecd countries where the share of agriculture in both gdp and employment is less than 3 however when timmer 2009 talks about a world without agriculture it may be a misnomer he does not mean economies are functioning without agriculture rather that the share of agriculture in national income is diminished to the point where the share of value added in agriculture is miniscule compared to the rest of the economic sectors 3 however timmer 2009 also notes that the labour productivity of those remain in the agriculture sector are no different to those in other sectors of the economy however despite this declining role for agriculture it still has an important role to play in ensuring this structural transformation is underway raising agriculture productivity is critical to create a surplus of food labour and savings in oecd countries despite a considerable decline in the shares of agriculture in gdp and employment this decline was met by an increase in agriculture labour productivity relative to nonagriculture closing the gaps of labour productivity between the two sectors therefore in a world without agriculture there is no discernible difference between the average labour productivity of a worker in the agriculture sector compared to a worker outside it agricultural poverty has been eliminated with the goal of raising agriculture productivity established the historical sources of increased labour productivity were through intensification in modern inputs use andor mechanisation dorin et al 2013 intensification with these inputs involve raising the area under irrigation usage of highyielding varieties of seeds enhanced synthetized fertiliser and pesticide use to raise land productivity mechanisation in turn affects productivity by allowing more land to be worked per worker india has made significant strides in improving land productivity but at the expense of sustainability declining soil health and water availability are the two biggest issues india faces in maintaining food security going forward with climate change expected to negatively impact crop productivity developing countries are now grappling with the twin goals of raising productivity whilst trying to enhance sustainability and resilience the goals can often seem to be at odds with each other in fact the oecd canonical path of structural transformation has been questioned by some authors dorin et al 2013 show that rather than a singular path as envisaged by timmer 2009 a country can actually be on one of any four different paths critical in determining which path a country is on is first the income gap defined as the difference in shares of agriculture in gdp a new paradigm for indian agriculture3 introduction and employment this gap is usually negative at first as the share of agriculture in employment is greater than the share of agriculture in gdp as a country develops this gap tends to zero as observed in oecd countries the second element of dorins typology is the growth rate of active population in agriculture over the chosen time period a country on the path to a structural transformation described by timmer 2009 will see the income gap close over time and see negative growth rates of the active population in agriculture the path as described by timmer 2009 has been termed as a lewis path by dorin et al where the active population in agriculture declines and income gaps become smaller the polar opposite of this path is the lewis trap where the active population in agriculture increases and income gaps widen leading to greater inequality and poverty the other path is termed as a farmer developing path where the income gap decreases but the active population in agriculture decreases the opposite of the farmer developing path is the farmer excluding path where the active population in agriculture decreases with income gaps widening the purpose of this paper is manifold section ii briefly reviews the process of structural transformation in india its key characteristics and the role of agriculture in the development process this section tells us that raising land and labour productivity in agriculture is critical in the process of structural transformation by imagining india and its constituent states on the path to a world without agriculture wwa section iii reviews trends in labour productivity and terms of trade to discern trends in indias performance towards that path it is found that overall india is still a long way from a wwa but some states are closer than the others the paper then reviews the challenges faced by current indian agriculture in section iv delineating them into productivity enhancing challenges and sustainability challenges it is found that whilst india has done well in increasing land yields labour productivity is still constrained keeping agriculture productivity growth deflated the discussion in this section also shows that increasing intensification of agriculture has led to severe environmental damage in the face of climate change mitigation and adaptation india now faces the twin goals of raising productivity whilst seeking to enhance sustainability and resilience section v reviews the indian situation with dorins four paths of structural transformation the primary conclusion from this section is that land constraints appear to be a significant explanator of low labour productivity growth rates it then shows that indian states have been following one or other of these four paths since 1993 but most states as well as india overall are on a farmer excluding path where the active population in agriculture has seen a decline but income gaps continue to widen many of the other states are seen to be on the lewis trap path and very few in a lewis path or farmer developing path the key conclusion from this section is that a paradigm shift in agriculture is necessary to ensure the longterm health of indias agriculture sector section vi introduces the concept of agroecology as an alternative to todays industrial farming systems it calls for a complete shift in the approach towards agriculture as the only solution to these seemingly mutually exclusive goals of raising productivity and ensuring sustainability section vii presents some highlevel policy implications that such a shift would necessitate and section viii concludes the process of structural transformationiia new paradigm for indian agriculture6 the process of structural transformation the economy of india at the time of independence and now is starkly different we have gone from an era of shortages to surpluses in grains this change is reflective of the structural transformation india has undergone indeed this process is something all countries in the world have gone through or will go through structural transformation has been defined as both the cause and effect of economic growth timmer 2009 identifies three interrelated processes that define the structural transformation i a declining share of agriculture in national income employment with rising secondary tertiary sectors of the economy at the end of the process the productivity gap between agriculture nonagriculture sectors is extremely small several oecd countries have transitioned into a world without agriculture wwa where both the share of agriculture in gdp and in employment is now less than 3 ii rural to urban migration increasing urbanisation is witnessed in all countries that are undergoing the process of structural transformation industrialisation has had a key role to play in this regard new urban centres come up with shenzhen in china being the most pertinent contemporary example iii from high birth rates deaths to low birth rates and deaths as health systems improve high mortality rates gradually improve birth rates decline a international evidence the evidence presented by timmer 2009 spanned 86 countries between 1965 and 2000 he finds a negative relationship to exist between percapita incomes and share of agriculture in gdp in employment this provides statistical evidence that as percapita incomes increase the role of agriculture in the overall economy becomes smaller the results also show that the rate of decline in agricultures share in gdp is faster than employment setting up a potential mismatch between the two the author defines this difference in shares as a gap and constructs a measure of a ruralurban income gap based on these gaps the author finds that the ruralurban income gap only becomes larger as an economy grows this is due to labour productivity growing faster in the urban areas rather than rural ones further he finds that agriculture terms of trade tot are used as an effective policy tool to smoothen the integration of agriculture with the rest of the economy it is also becoming increasingly harder to close this productivity gap between the agriculture and nonagriculture sectors the author claims that the global growth process has been failing to integrate lowproductivity agricultural labour into the rest of the economy this finding has serious implications for india an interesting finding from this work is the divergent paths taken by asian countries compared to others he finds that the pattern of employment change in the agriculture sector in asian economies did not follow the pattern set by nonasian ones the results indicate that asian countries employed a disproportionately large number of agriculture workers in the early stages of development the tot variable was positive and statistically significant for asia whilst it was negative and statistically significant for others this finding leads the author to conclude that asian countries provided price incentives to the agriculture sectors as a way to prevent the movement out from being too fast a new paradigm for indian agriculture7 the process of structural transformation b the role of agriculture despite a shrinking role of agriculture in the process of structural transformation agriculture still has an important role in catalysing this transformation according to timmer 2009 the linkages between agriculture and development were first discussed by lewis 1954 in the classic dualsector model of an economy where growth is explained as a transition of labour between two sectors the capitalist sector and the subsistence sector for overpopulated countries as termed by lewis the central to the process of development was moving a large number of underemployed workers with low productivity to a modern capitalist sector with higher productivity and wages gollin 2014 these conclusions are similar to the ones drawn by jorgenson 1967 lewis further assumed that capital could only be employed in the modern sector giving us the distinction between the two sectors according to gollin 2014 this assumption required either a market failure or technological barriers keeping capital from flowing to the subsistence sector these assumptions may perhaps be weakly true in the case of india whilst the agriculture sector has seen modernisation there still remains a credit gap similarly farmer returns have not been growing at the same pace as nonfarm returns reflecting a widening income gap the distinction between indias agriculture sector and nonagriculture sectors are clear to see timmer 2009 claims that historically no country has been able to sustain a rapid transition without increasing productivity in the agriculture sector first through higher productivity agriculture is able to provide food labour and savings to the process of urbanisation and industrialisation johnston and mellor 1961 this finding is also supported by the results of gollin parente rogerson 2002 who showed that low agricultural productivity slows down the industrialisation process studying the process of structural transformation in asia it is found that the lewis turning point where the shift from surplus labour to shortage in agriculture labour reflected in rising agricultural wages is yet to be reached by most asian countries briones and felipe 2013 these findings corroborate the conclusions in timmer 2009 however timmer also noted that this turning point is coming at higher and higher levels of percapita incomes making the transition harder and more challenging for developing countries until this turning point is reached income gap between farm and nonfarm activities continues to widen based on the literature discussed above the role of agriculture in the structural transformation seems clear productivity in this sector needs to increase to generate a surplus of food labour and savings which then fuel the growth of industrialisation and urbanisation therefore even though countries are moving to a world without agriculture this path is built on the back of a modernising agriculture sector is india headed for a world without agricultureiiia new paradigm for indian agriculture10 is india headed for a world without

gdp has been falling it has not fallen by a commensurate pace in employment figure 2 plots the path of various states on the wwa sufficient heterogeneity is revealed the southern states of kerala tamil nadu karnataka seem to closest to a wwa relative to others states in north india are found to be right in the middle of the chart in absolute terms all states have a long way to go to a wwa where the share of agriculture in employment and in gdp is less than 3 the gap between agriculture share of employment and gdp is also evident from figure 2 states like punjab haryana for example exhibit a small gap indicating the relatively more prosperous nature of farmers there compared to the rest of india then there are states such as maharashtra karnataka kerala tamil nadu and gujarat where the gap is much wider these states have seen their secondary and tertiary sectors grow with the share of agriculture in gdp falling below 10 yet in terms of share in employment the decline has been less steep this in fact was a finding emphasised by timmer 2009 this gap in agricultures income share and employment share is a major driver of inequality in developing countriesa new paradigm

during this time we have also witnessed a slowing in the pace at which the share of agriculture in employment was declining from the analysis above it is clear that indias structural transformation as defined by timmer 2009 is incomplete india is still a long way from a world without agriculture there remains a substantial gap between the share of agriculture in employment and national incomes the productivity gap between agricultural workers and nonagricultural workers continues to widen however these are factors that timmer 2009 predicted in his seminal work the only way out according to him was raising investments in agriculture to boost productivity which would eventually close both the gap in share of agriculture in employment and national income and the gap in labour productivity between agriculture and nonagricultural sectors of the economy since the mid20th century raising labour productivity in agriculture is a function of input intensification and motorisation dorin et al 2013 this means raising the intensity of inputs such as using highyielding varieties hyvs seeds expanded irrigation coverage use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides paired with the mechanisation of agriculture through lesser use of farm labour the use of tractors threshers and other machineries and robots to replace them the strides made by india during the green revolution were both in and out of this policy prescription however new challenges are on the horizon whilst the old ones still remain the next section analyses these challenges challenges in indian agricultureiva new paradigm for indian agriculture16 challenges in indian agriculture over the years several legacy issues have emerged in indian agriculture one set of challenges is related to increasing labour productivity in the average indian farm many indian farms are caught in a low labour productivity trap leading to depleted incomes intensification of inputs have been one avenue of increasing land productivity which have delivered impressive results increase in area under irrigation since the green revolution and increased use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides have seen land productivity increase manifold this green revolution ensured india going from a cereal deficit country to a cereal surplus one however the intensification of inputs apart from their rising costs to farmers are also posing serious environmental costs to the nation and indeed the world this is where the second set of challenges comes in to play which are related to the sustainability of the current set of practices being prescribed in india the first part of this section will explore the factors impeding productivity in india the second part of this section will present evidence on the environmental costs being incurred by these practices a productivityenhancing challenges farm sizes labour productivity is constrained owing to land sizes the average farm size in india has been consistently becoming smaller hampering labour productivity and limiting economies of scale as table 2 shows the average farm size in india has roughly halved in size since 197071 this also implies a prevalence of small landholders close to 85 of indias holdings are operated by small and marginal farmers smf table 2 average size of operational holdings hectares 197071 to 201516 year size 197071 228 197677 200 198081

procurement and distribution network ensured cereals were procured from farmers at announced minimum support prices msps credit despite a provision of rs 15 lakh crores rs 15 trillion of credit to the agriculture sector in the union budget of 202021 access to formal credit still remains constrained for many of indias farmers according to a nabard survey approximately 30 of all agricultural households had borrowed money from noninstitutional sources which is primarily made up of relatives friends or informal moneylenders as per the survey farmers with smaller plot sizes took a greater share of loans from the noninstitutional lenders than did farmers with larger plot sizes 2 hectares nabard 2018 this indicates that more small and marginal farmers rely on expensive informal sources of credit than large ones a positive relationship has been found with increased formal credit availability and agriculture gdp growth primarily through enabling greater input use the results obtained by the author narayanan 2016 show that a 10 increase in institutional credit flow to agriculture leads to a 21 increase in gdp controlling for inflation similarly narayanan shows that a 10 increase in institutional credit leads to a 17 increase in fertiliser consumption a 51 increase in pesticide consumption and 108 increase in tractor purchases therefore through enabling the use of more inputs credit should lead to an increase in land productivity at least to a certain point 2 the latest published data available is for the year 201819 source landuse statistics published by the directorate

best modern practices to the level of the farmer extension services are perhaps the most critical link in raising land productivity through industrial agriculture gulati et al 2018 gulati et al note that india has one of the largest agricultural research systems in the world and provide an excellent overview of indias network of agriculture extension the authors call for expanded investments in agriculture research and education to 1 of agrigdp from 07 of agrigdp to boost land productivity the committee on doubling farmers income recognised several shortcomings with the existing system of extension they recognised that extension services have been focusing more on production aspects whereas the need of farmers had shifted to postproduction aspects gulati et al 2018 noted that public extension services are skewed in favour of the crop sector and needed to take a more holistic view of the agriculture sector including animal husbandry for instance the committee on doubling farmers income also questioned whether the current system of extension was able to discourage inefficient farm practices such as flood irrigation imbalance in the use of fertilisers and pesticides they also recognised that extension services were not focused on serving all aspects of the agricultural supply chain nor were the targets set for extension agencies outcome oriented this short discussion serves the purpose of highlighting the underdeveloped nature of extension services in india funding constraints lead to manpower constraints however the effectiveness of the existing extension systems has also been questioned by a government committee underdeveloped extension services have not only created a yield gap but also led to the proliferation of inefficient and unsustainable practices causing major sustainability challenges b environmental challenges as mentioned over the years inefficient practices have come to dominate flood irrigation excessive use of nitrogen n over potash p and potassium k and excessive pesticide use are some examples agriculture also contributes to air pollution through emission of greenhouse gases ghgs independent estimates peg this figure to be 196 of total ghg emissions olivier et al 2017 similarly stubble burning is a significant contributor to the fall in air quality all over north india during winter months as a result degrading soil health and declining availability of water are perhaps the critical issues facing farms in india today as noted earlier critical to raising productivity is raising the area under irrigation as it would enable multicropping application of fertilisers etc this creates a dichotomy under the regime of industrial agriculture the only way to increase productivity is to increase intensification in inputs but this increased intensification will lead to environmental degradation requiring more and more intensification with each cycle soil health degrading soil health is another factor that will affect productivity growing forward according to the national academy of agriculture sciences naas 2018 degradation of soil can occur due to four reasons i salinisationalkanisation ii acidification iii soil toxification through chemicals and iv depletion of nutrients and organic matter soil organic carbon soc has been cited as an important indicator of soil health due to its contributions to food

jharkhand punjab are applying fertilisers above the prescribed norms the rest of the states are utilising less fertiliser than prescribed as per the results of chand and pavithra 2015 the conventional knowledge has been that at a national level a ratio of 421 was ideal however as noted by chand and pavithra 2015 this norm needs to be revisited especially as a national level norm cannot reflect the heterogeneity across and within states table 4 compares the normative ratios against the actual ratios the imbalance in fertiliser use towards n is evident across all states on the impact of imbalanced use of fertilisers on soil health the authors note that where the actual use of fertiliser is below the prescribed use the impact on soil health of npk balance will be negligible it is pertinent to note that the npk imbalance is the greatest in states with the highest area under irrigation in interpreting tables 6 7 it must be kept in mind that the norms derived by chand pavithra 2015 were based on the cropping patterns prevalent during 201112 since the cropping patterns may have changed since then the prescribed norms would have altered as well it is for this reason the prescribed norms as per the paper are presented against the actual usage and ratios for 201112 and 201920 recalculating the prescribed norms of fertiliser usage based on the package of practices published by state agriculture universities saus and the indian council of agriculture research icar is beyond the scope of this paper as such an exercise is a paper in its own right this remains a future avenue of research where the normative fertiliser usage is calculated at regular intervals to aid policymaking yet a preliminary analysis was undertaken to understand if there has been any

benefits of economies of scale do not accrue to small and marginal farmers india is facing two interrelated challenges the first is raising land productivity to continue meeting the demands of a growing population the second challenge is raising productivity whilst ensuring sustainable and resilient farms both challenges are interrelated but at times seem at odds with each other increasing the intensification of industrial agriculture which has been an ongoing process and resulted in increased land productivity has resulted in environmental damage however without increasing productivity india may face food shortages in the future therefore the challenge in front of india and indeed the rest of the developing world is to increase land and farm labour productivity whilst maintaining sustainability and building resilience to climate changeis industrial transformation a possible path for indian agricultureva new paradigm for indian agriculture28 is industrial transformation a possible path for indian agriculture so far the literature has established that raising both land and labour productivity in agriculture is critical for a country to complete its structural transformation however section iv showed that india faces severe challenges in raising both productivities with inputs of the green revolution moreover ensuring sustainability and resilience of farms has emerged as a crucial policy goal in the face of climate change at times it seems the goals of raising productivity and sustainability are at odds with each other productivity in agriculture can be raised through intensification higher production per unit of land andor motorisation higher cultivated land per worker dorin et al 2013 formulate a technology affluence and labour productivity in agriculture tala equation to represent this relationship given below aaqa q ll l q agricultural production mt a cultivated area ha la workforce in agriculture where q a intensification mtha and aa l motorisation haworker according to the tala equation and based on the evidence presented in section iii it is clear that labour productivity in agriculture is being constrained by the net availability of land per worker as table 2 shows the average farm size in india has been on a decline while intensification has grown as yields have increased availability of land seems to be constraining indias labour productivity critical to the structural transformation is the share of labour in agriculture as recognised by timmer 2009 dorin et al 2013 derive two statistics aa a ayllabour income gap lig yl y ylabour income ratio lir l l they note that in the structural transformation path envisaged by timmer 2009 the lig is initially negative and then tends towards zero the lir is initially less than 1 but tends to unity as the process continues the authors derive two important results first the lir increases only when agricultural labour productivity grows faster than average labour productivity second the number of agricultural workers only decreases when labour productivity grows faster than agricultural output based on this analysis the authors draw not one but four potential paths to structural transformation i farmer developing path in this path farm nonfarm incomes converge lir 1 while the number of farmers increases the authors note that if the source of demand of agricultural commodities comes from foreign markets then this path may be one of urban poverty a new paradigm for indian agriculture29 is industrial transformation a possible path for indian agriculture ii lewis path this is the canonical structural transformation path as envisaged by timmer 2009 and described later by dorin 2021 as the path of industrialisation without land constraints here the lir 1 and number of farmers decreases this decreasing workforce in agriculture increases land availability per farmer raising agricultural labour productivity at a faster pace than farm output and nonfarm labour productivity iii lewis trap here farm and nonfarm incomes widen and the agricultural workforce increases farm labour productivity grows at a slower pace than average labour productivity and farm output unless land availability per worker increases then gains to farm labour productivity will be limited this is the polar opposite of the lewis path iv farmer excluding path farm and nonfarm incomes widen and number of farmers decreases there are fewer farmers poorer than other workers examining the path of several countries dorin et al found that from the 1960s to 2007 only a few countries namely oecd countries and transition countries russia eastern europe have followed the lewis path of structural transformation latin america the middle east africa have been found to follow the farmerdeveloping path whilst asia has entered a lewis trap land constraints emerge as a key determinant of the structural transformation path a country embarks on according to the results of dorin et al 2013 an inverse relationship between farm size and labour productivity has long been claimed in india bhalla 1979 using measures of land fragmentation and the impact on cost of cultivation it has been found that once land fragmentation falls below a threshold mechanisation tends to become more difficult deininger et al 2017 in turn the inability to mechanise falls on small and marginal farmers the correlation between larger farm sizes and mechanisation has found further support mehta et al 2014 state that mechanising small plots is against economies of scale especially for land preparation and harvesting on the other hand there is literature that emphasises that small farms are actually more productive per unit of land than their larger counterparts for instance it has been contented that small farms have been using higher doses of inputs making more intensive use of land and adopting new technology better than large farms chand and srivastava 2014 however the authors also note that despite advantages in land productivity and a better production performance percapita availability of land constrains their income from agriculture from the discussion above shrinking land availability per worker has been identified as a primary reason for widening gaps in labour productivity between agriculture and nonagriculture sectors of the indian economy as earlier sections have shown there exists considerable heterogeneity amongst indian states when it comes to agriculture therefore examining the paths to structural transformation that indian states have taken is important from a policy standpoint the next section will attempt to place india and large indian states on the four paths highlighted by dorin et al 2013 following the methodology of dorin et al the

agriculture30 is industrial transformation a possible path for indian agriculture figures for 201819 201920 have been taken from the successor of the eus the periodic labour force survey plfs3 annual estimates of population have been taken from interpolating between various census periods 1991 2001 2011 population estimates for states since 2011 have been derived through gsdp data4 the workerpopulation ratio wpr estimates from these surveys have then been applied to the population estimates to arrive at estimates of total employment and agriculture employment in absolute terms based on these estimates we are able to compute the variables of interest for indian states to extend the analysis of dorin et al 2013 namely the variables of interest are the active population in agriculture on the x axis and the labour income ratio lir on the y axis5 whose annual growth rates are cumulated over the years to show their evolutions since 199394 our starting year here at the intersection of the x and y axes there exist however some limitations with data employment and population in particular first there is no official backseries which gives us gsdp at 201112 prices the rebasing exercise undertaken is a quick workaround since we do not have any official annual estimates of population except for decadal censuses the compound annual growth rate cagr has been used to interpolate between census years for instance it also may be possible despite falling shares of agriculture in employment the cagr in agricultural workers may be positive owing to population growth during this time furthermore since 199394 several new states have been carved out of existing ones namely chhattisgarh jharkhand and uttarakhand in 2001 and telangana in 2014 data for these states has been merged into their original states to give us a continuous series the results presented in figure 11 show that since 1993 india continued to sink into the lewis trap until 2010 as shown by dorin et al 2013 from 1971 to 2007 with united nations annual statistics on indias gva and employment then bifurcated towards the farmer excluding path where the active population in agriculture tends to decrease in absolute numbers while its income gap with nonfarmers continues to widen now in 201920 we see india returning on to the path of the lewis trap as the share of those employed in agriculture increased in 201920 this is perhaps reflective of the migration back to rural areas of migrant workers owing to the pandemic induced lockdown in march 2020 against this national trend since 1993 table 10 and figure 12 shows heterogeneity amongst states most indian states have remained locked either in the lewis trap or the farmer excluding path since 1993 moreover after at least three decades of growing agricultural labour force and income gap with nonfarmers since 1970 dorin et al 2013 3 at this point it is prudent to note that while data on gdp follows the financial year aprilmarch the plfs reports cover the period julyjune therefore for the last year of analysis data of gdp is reflective till march 2020 and employment data till june 2020 4 gsdp data provides both gsdp and gsdp per capita allowing us to calculate population 5 the lir is defined as the ratio of agricultures share in gsdp on agricultures share in employment in the lewis path of structural transformation this ratio is initially less than 1 but then tends to one therefore the closer to one the lower the gapa new paradigm for indian agriculture31 is industrial transformation a possible path for indian agriculture

authors only largest indian states are representeda new paradigm for indian agriculture36 is industrial transformation a possible path for indian agriculture the findings in this section broadly seem to corroborate the findings of dorin et al 2013 they are also consistent with the discussion in section iii of this paper for any region to embark on the lewis path then not only does the active population in agriculture need to decrease but agricultural productivity growth has to be faster than nonagriculture labour productivity but also farm output productivity which can be increased through intensification section iii and iv showed us that productivity in the nonagricultural sector has grown at a faster pace than agriculture india has made significant gains in increasing land productivity through intensification but shrinking land availability as evidenced through decreasing farm sizes has meant that indias agriculture labour productivity has grown at a slower pace than non agriculture labour productivity all in all india does not seem to be on the canonical path to structural transformation raising productivity would require intensification of inputs combined with an increase in percapita availability of land india is constrained on both fronts as section iii showed the average farm size in india is shrinking and intensification of inputs are causing severe environmental stress and seem unsustainable given the impending threat of climate change therefore the policy goals in front of india can seem to be at odds with each other a trade off emerges between raising productivity and ensuring sustainability however an idea that has been gaining traction is that of agroecology a holistic agroecological approach has the potential to convert these seemingly at odds policy goals to complementary ones the next section discusses agroecology the attempts in india to promote natural farming and offers policy suggestions drawn from the literature agroecology as a potential solutionvia new paradigm for indian agriculture38 agroecology as a potential solution the canonical structural transformation path has been eluding india earlier sections have shown that whilst india has done well in improving land productivity through increasing intensification of industrial inputs labour productivity remains constrained owing to declining availability of land intensification of inputs has also led to severe environmental degradation calling into question the sustainability of such practices going ahead according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 we could see crop yield declines of 1025 per cent by 2050 therefore the challenge in front of india is to increase agriculture productivity whilst ensuring sustainability the current policy paradigm of focusing on a few crops and crop monocultures increasing intensity of inputs such as chemical fertilisers and pesticides unchecked use of flood irrigation has led to degrading soil health and stressed water availability at the same time there exists a link between agriculture and nutrition sustainable development goals sdg2 calls not only for zero hunger but also to end all forms of malnutrition indias nutritional outcomes where 384 of children under 5 were stunted 210 wasted and 358 underweight prompted a new national nutrition mission the food agriculture and nutrition fan report of 2020 shows that indias nutritional transition is in contrast to the transition made by other countries as they advance economically tci 2020 the authors note that as a country advances economically the first stage consists of increasing consumption of vegetables fruits and animal products the second stage then involves increasing consumption of more calorie dense foods india seems to have skipped to increasing consumption of calorie dense foods such as wheat and rice aided by public policy since the green revolution era the report notes the fan report also notes that agriculture impacts individual nutrition outcomes primarily through improving household food access this improved access is a result of better incomes and access to diverse foods sdg2 apart from calling for zero hunger and an end to malnutrition also calls for a doubling of incomes and productivity of smallscale producers therefore the need is to usher in a new paradigm in indian agriculture one that combines the goals of increasing productivity sustainability and access to diverse foods dorin et al 2013 lay out the economic fundamentals of this alternative through a simple equation a pq ynaa la where a farmer incomes p farmgate prices q production ynaa cost of inputs produced by nonagri sector fertilisers pesticides and la number of farmers according to the authors we need to increase production q and farm incomes without strongly downsizing the agriculture labour force la and threatening the environment the authors note that past rd efforts have focused on monocultures such as wheat rice etc which has substantially increased production whilst raising input costs at the same time the environmental effects were discussed in section iv based on the equation above the authors devise the parameters of this alternative system first a reduction in industrial inputs ynaa second biological synergies between many plant and animal species both above and below the ground to boost production q and increase resilience third improved human abilities la in managing these smallscale and biologically complex synergies higher prices p to a new paradigm for indian agriculture39 agroecology as a potential solution farmers for supply of diversified and nutritious food and for the wider ecological services they provide the positive externalities that accrue to the environment the authors note that these parameters developed are in fact similar to those of agroecology overall smallscale farmers like in india could not only be highly productive per unit of land but also close their income gap with nonfarmers if diverse tasty nutritious and healthy foods are better priced on local and international markets as well environmental goods or services that are of local or global value but are currently unpaid such as biodiversity reservoirs resilience to biotic and abiotic shocks nutrient recycling water saving and filtering or soil carbon storage dorin 2021 the report of the highlevel panel of experts hlpe 2019 on agroecology notes that agroecology is transdisciplinary science which initially focused on understanding fieldlevel farming practices such as natural farming in india it is increasingly being promoted to transform existing food systems into sustainable food systems sfs through regenerative use of natural resources in agriculture while there is no definitive set of practices there exist three characteristics which can be identified as agroecological i reliance on ecological processes rather than purchased inputs ii equitable environmentally friendly locally adapted and controlled and iii they adopt a systems approach the hlpe has also set out 13 agroecological principles related to soil health animal health and welfare biodiversity synergy managing interactions economic diversification cocreation of knowledge embracing local knowledge and global science social values and diets fairness connectivity land and natural resource governance and participation various approaches can be encompassed under agroecology at this point a comparison between industrial agriculture and agroecology would be prudent the excellent work of frison 2016 provides a comparison recreated in figure 13 the differences in the two approaches are clear through this figure the intentional inclusion of functional biodiversity at multiple spatial and temporal scales through either traditional practices or scientifically developed ones is a distinguishing feature of agroecology kremen and bacon 2016 the authors note that whilst diversified farm systems share much in common with multifunctional organic and sustainable farming it differs from these concepts in a subtle way the critical differentiator according to the authors is that the design of farming systems to support functional biodiversity ensure that the critical inputs required by agriculture are supplied most authors on agroecology emphasise the socioeconomic facets of switching to agroecological systems the first impact is that on farm incomes through reduced input costs frison 2016 kremen et al 2012 diversification also protects farmer incomes through reducing the risks associated with variable yields since organic products command a premium in markets owing to their associated health benefits farmer incomes increase owing to higher prices received as well given that agroecological systems are more labour intensive there exist significant employment opportunities especially in onfarm processing and direct marketing channels a new paradigm for indian agriculture40 agroecology as a potential solution industrial agriculture agroecology crop monocultures or select crops at farmlandscape level concentrated animal feeding operations use of genetically uniform varieties vertical and horizontal segregation of product chains mechanised labour saving systems maximisation of yield from a single or limited number of products intensive use of

economy approach shorter value chains less homogenous products figure 13 industrial agriculture vs agroecological approaches source frison e a 2016 from uniformity to diversity a paradigm shift from industrial agriculture to diversified agroecological systems given the impact on the covid19 pandemic agroecology has also been put forward as a solution as it has been asserted that local food systems can better withstand disruptions in supply chains altieri nicholls 2020 assert that there are five main areas through which agroecology can point a new way for agriculture reduced reliance on pesticides enriching biodiversity revitalising small farms creating alternative animal production systems and enhancing urban agriculture this agroecological approach can be seen in many parts of india since 2019 natural farming in india is being promoted nationally as the bharatiya prakritik krishi paddhati bpkp programme this programme seeks to promote agroecology based diversified farming system which integrates crops trees and livestock with functional biodiversity reducing a reliance on externally purchased inputs the system is largely based on onfarm biomass recycling stressing biomass mulching use of onfarm cow dungurine formulation and soil aeration clearly this is in line with the characteristics of agroecological approaches discussed earlier according to a niti aayog roughly 25 million farmers across india are already practicing agroecological approaches over the next five years an additional 2 million hectares are to be brough under natural farming the state of andhra pradesh is taking the lead in india in popularising natural farming starting from approximately 40000 farmers and 704 villages in 201617 over 695000 farmers across 3011 villages were practicing natural farming in 201920 third party evaluations have shown a new paradigm for indian agriculture41 agroecology as a potential solution improvement in yields most significantly in paddy bengal gram pulses and chillies and farm net income galab et al 2020 and kumar et al 2020 it was also shown that significant cost savings can be made by governments themselves through reductions in costly fertiliser and electricity subsidies eg gupta et al 2020 in turn the reduced energy subsidy burden on agriculture could be utilised in the domestic and industrial sector improving access and service there himachal pradesh is another state that has been leading the efforts in switching to sustainable farming systems over 77106 farmers have been trained in natural farming practices covering 12 districts of the state lower disease incidence in apple and wheat have been recorded productivity of apples a major produce in himachal pradesh was seen to have improved under natural farming when compared to prevalent practices the benefits of agroecological approaches to farming such as natural farming in terms of reduced input costs and no discernible impact on yields as indicated by galab et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 point towards a net increase in income for farmers compared to prevalent practices the next section discusses some possible directions for policy analysis to evaluate and then popularize agroecological practices in indiapolicy implicationsviia new paradigm for indian agriculture44 policy implications based on the discussions in this paper a broad set of policy directions can be distilled to provide direction for further academic research to fine tune the policy recommendations at the outset it must be recognised that any paradigm shift is likely to cut across various functional areas furthermore these implications represent the starting area for policy deliberations not the final policy recommendations themselves overall the implications for policy have been designed on the basis of the goals of both increasing productivity and ensuring sustainability 1 from food to food systems india has focused on improving access to cereals and achieved significant results in the quest to double farmers income diversification of farm incomes has been cited as an important strategy with intercropping and multicropping at its core natural farming could scientifically contribute to the solution there are also calls to diversify the diets provided by the national food security act and the midday meal scheme tci 2020 indias experience is testament to the fact that public procurement can incentivise production of certain crops public procurement in the initial years can provide as an incentive towards diversification of farm produce preference to procurement from natural farming practising farmer organisations can be an incentive to popularise natural farming 2 overhaul of incentives and subsidies as per the union budget 202021 rs 79998 crores were spent on fertiliser subsidies by the union government in 201920 in comparison the entire budget for the department of agriculture research education dare stood at approximately rs 7500 crores in 201920 similarly the total transfers to states for agriculture extension services stood at rs 940 crores many state governments also provide power subsidies to farmers making the input subsidy bill even bigger in reality the transfer to states as part of the paramparagat krishi vikas yojana pkvy was rs 300 crores in 201920 therefore funding for natural farming will have to be scaled up substantially to give a larger push to agroecology pkvy can be reoriented as a central sector scheme with funding scaling up as the area under natural farming increases promoting natural farming will reduce the reliance on inputs and hence the large subsidy bill for fertilisers electricity water and credit this cost saving can then be translated to higher allocations under pkvy 3 new monitoring and evaluation framework a set of indicators with clearly defined inputs outputs and expected outcomes needs to be developed frison 2016 to measure the performance of states funding allocation to the scaled up pkvy can be linked to the performance of states on this set of indicators third party validation of data should also be promoted in partnership with either the private sector or the civil society this will ensure robustness and transparency of data on the portal these indicators are in turn bound to be in synergy with the sustainable development goals as well development of the initial framework could perhaps be undertaken by the development monitoring and evaluation office dmeo niti aayog the framework can then be finalised in consultation with the relevant ministries and state governments a new paradigm for indian agriculture45 policy implications 4 documentation of natural farming practices in india as mentioned earlier agroecological approaches are highly context specific therefore there is no one system of natural farming that can be propagated all across india the need of the hour is to document and widely disseminate these practices based on local conditions at the same time there is a need to develop some overarching principles as the fao hlpe report has identification of these principles will also aid in the certification process which is critical in commanding higher prices in terminal markets standards also need to de developed to grade and assay produce from natural farming 5 farmer handholding since natural farming is a knowledgeintensive system cotraining and coeducating farmers on the benefits of agroecological approaches remains the key challenge the success of andhra pradesh in popularising natural farming was in part due to longterm handholding of farmers government support and advocacy was critical as well therefore increasing extension budgets and reorienting extension services to promote natural farming is the need of the hour the central government can take the lead in this aspect through making pkvy a central sector scheme to develop extension systems to popularise natural farming a cornerstone of the efforts the role of farmer producer organisations fpos selfhelp groups shgs will be critical in these efforts as well 6 partnerships with the civil society and private sector partnering with the civil society would help in reaching farmers for training and capacity building these partnerships could also result in enabling a robust monitoring and evaluation framework as well the private sector can have a role to play here as well whilst india lags behind in food processing a large part of industrial agriculture products feed the food processing industry the requirements of such industries are therefore based on the prevalent system of production partnering with the private sector to develop processable varieties that can be used as inputs in the food processing industry keeping in mind the principles of natural farming is another area to explore processed products based on organic inputs sell at substantial premiums 7 collectivisation of farmers another way to reach a large group of farmers can be through collectivising them into producer organisations or cooperatives the government of india is already pushing for the creation of farmer collectives at a large scale this push can be effectively leveraged to popularise natural farming the andhra pradesh model showed that women organised through selfhelp groups shgs enabled collective action and peer learning these farmer collectives can then be connected to terminal markets or partners in the food processing industry as described above this will boost their bargaining power a new paradigm for indian agriculture46 policy implications 8 transfer payments for ecological services rendered as stated by dorin et al 2013 2021 for agroecology to be popularised farmers need to be compensated not just for their produce but also the ecological services they render india already has a mechanism to directly deliver cash to farmers bank accounts this system can be leveraged to transfer benefits directly to farmers for the ecological services they render at present there exists no such system where direct payments are being made to farmers for the ecological services they render while there have been some experiments they usually exist in a single domain eg water management or are limited in scale for instance in the pes schemes reviewed by drucker ramirez 2020 payments were made for biodiversity conservation and limited to a single crop similarly von thaden et al 2021 explore the effectiveness on payments for hydrological services in velacruz mexico jayachandran et al 2017 explore the effectiveness of pes to conserve forests on private land in uganda while they find the payments reduced deforestation and degradation such payments have not yet been demonstrated at scale in the indian context a case has been made by devi et al 2021 venkatachalam balooni 2018 also make a case for pes for participatory water management in tamil nadu in terms of measuring and valuing ecosystem services the united nations statistical commission unsc in march 2021 adopted the system of environmental economic accounting ecosystem accounting seeaea framework in india preliminary work on environmental accounting has been initiated by the ministry of statistics programme implementation mospi under the natural capital accounting valuation of ecosystem services ncaves project the first report was published in january 2021 based on the literature and the data available moving towards pes in agriculture in india still remains some time away however it may be prudent to explore the contours of such a system such as acceptable indicators data required payment level farmer by farm etc for instance if payments are made by practice eg natural farming then mechanisms of valuing these services still need to be evolved since the work still at a nascent stage both in terms of global practices and data available ideating on such a system will be an exercise that involves economists statisticians ecologists policymakers and other stakeholders 9 investments in the cold chain regardless of the way it is produced postharvest management is critical as well annual wastage in excess of rs 90000 crores have been estimated as a result of inefficient post harvest management development of infrastructure at the farmgate preprocessing facilities which are then linked to packhouses and cold storages is critical in linking farmers to terminal markets be they retail or exports despite claims that agroecological systems exhibit shorter value chains and produce is distributed locally there still exists a requirement of an endto end cold chain to connect farmers to terminal markets the government of india has recently launched a rs 1 lakh crore agriculture infrastructure fund for development of infrastructure close to the farmgate which can be leveraged by producer organisations a new paradigm for indian agriculture47 policy implications 10 leveraging frontier technologies the rising demand for organic products and the premiums paid for them are cited as a major reason for a shift towards organic or natural farming however without traceability and certification this market cannot be served by most of indias farmers a nationwide blockchain for quality certification and traceability may help solve this problem if such a blockchain does not consume too much fossil energy this is another avenue for partnerships with the civil society and private sector the participatory guarantee scheme pgs for certification could be leveraged here this is just one example of the potential frontier technologies carry further research and collaborations are needed to examine the use of such technologies in the popularisation of natural farming in india conclusionviiia new paradigm for indian agriculture50 conclusion this paper has shown that the path of structural transformation india has taken is unsustainable land constraints are hampering indias agriculture labour productivity growth rates leading to widening income gaps and greater inequality intensification of inputs has seen yields in india grow manifold over the past decades allowing india to achieve cereal security and maintain sufficient buffer stocks for time of need however the intensification of inputs has led to severe environmental challenges this creates a tradeoff between the goals of increasing productivity and enhancing sustainability and resilience in order to ensure the longterm health of indias agriculture sector and indeed the economy a new paradigm for agriculture in india has been mooted in this paper this new paradigm would embrace the principles of agroecology while there is no definitive set of practices there exist three characteristics which can be identified as agroecological i reliance on ecological processes rather than purchased inputs ii equitable environmentally friendly locally adapted and controlled and iii they adopt a systems approach this agroecological approach can be seen in many parts of india natural farming in india is being promoted as the bharatiya prakritik krishi paddhati bpkp programme this programme seeks to promote agroecology based diversified farming system which integrates crops trees and livestock with functional biodiversity and reducing a reliance on externally purchased inputs the system is largely based on onfarm biomass recycling stressing biomass mulching use of onfarm cow dungurine formulation and soil aeration clearly this is in line with the characteristics of agroecological approaches discussed earlier the need of the hour is to scale up such initiatives across india agroecology carries with it the potential to convert this apparent tradeoff in policy goals to mutually compatible goals for this policy action will be critical extension services will need to be revamped subsidies and incentives will need to be overhauled a new monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be needed to track outcomes defined in terms of both sustainability and productivity natural farming practices across india will need to be documented verified and spread to the farm level using revamped extension services partnerships with both the civil society and private sector will be critical in spreading natural farming across india in order to make natural farming more remunerative for small and marginal farmers transfer payments for ecological services provided by farmers can be considered however certification will be critical in this endeavour this relates to the goal of documentation and verification of practices as natural as a set of practices must be identified prior to labelling a farm as natural public procurement may have an important role to play in demand generation especially in the initial years at the same time some existing policy thrusts must continue collectivisation of farmers through producer organisations is one thrust financial inclusion another investments across the coldchain remain critical in connecting farmers to terminal markets be they natural farmers or modern ones more research is needed in distilling actionable policy recommendations for a complete paradigm shift as mooted by this paper the policy implications derived in this paper can serve as a starting point for policy deliberations this paper has established that not only is indias structural transformation incomplete but it is on an unsustainable path a paradigm shift is needed in india shifting towards agroecological principles this would require a move away from the input intensification based agriculture in india today it would also need a recognition that farm sizes in india are unlikely to get a new paradigm for indian agriculture51 conclusion bigger unless there is strong political will towards land consolidation rather than seeing our small landholdings as a weakness policymakers must seek to leverage this into an opportunity especially as small farms have been shown to be more productive and receptive to change however this shift must ensure protection of farmers incomes along with longterm handholding to ensure the longterm health of indias agriculture

economy usually declines as it climbs the development ladder raising agriculture productivity has been known to be an important precursor labour productivity in agriculture can either be increased by higher land productivity or higher land availability per farmer and mechanisation in india however the dramatic increase in land productivity through industrial farming has caused severe environmental damage and did not boost agricultural labour productivity going ahead india faces the challenges of both increasing farm productivity and increasing sustainability and resilience to climate change
