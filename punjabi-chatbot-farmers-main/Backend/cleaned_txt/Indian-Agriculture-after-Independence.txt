of 75th year of indias independence azadi ka amrit mahotsav is the moment of great pride joy and honour india is among the few fortunate democratic countries in the world which is celebrating the platinum jubilee of its independence agriculture is one amongst the few sectors that made progressive growth after independence and marched well with the need of the country success in agriculture since independence has been the backbone of indias success the successful transformational narration of independent india therefore is incomplete without the narration of the agricultural transformation from ship to mouth to selfsufficiency and export the agricultural imperative and achievements of india has been appreciated globally the book indian agriculture after independence narrates the journey of agriculture in the last 75 years of postindependent india the progress of indian agriculture has been quite impressive despite several limiting factors such as uncertainties of weather declining soil health increasing atmospheric temperature and emergence of virulent pest and pathogens the transformation from an acutely foodscarce to foodexporting country could be realized with the concerted efforts by icar as frontal organization through development and dissemination of technology building human capital and establishing the rural farm centres to serve the farmers in this book we presented this challenging but successful journey of indian agriculture the book captures the uniqueness of indian agriculture and depicts the various revolutions in staple food livestock and fisheries making india a food scarce country to food surplus and food exporting nation the book also presents the aspirations of indian agriculture for improving income equity sustainability climate resilience and its human face using the emerging technologies i compliment the editors and authors for bringing out this publication that shall be useful for students academicians researches policymakers and public agencies to take the task of agricultural development the book will serve a treatise of milestones achievements impacts and lessons of indian agriculture during the last 75 years to guide the future path trilochan mohapatra prime minister smt indira gandhi visiting iari new delhi viiagriculture is the foundation of the civilization culture and heritage of india agriculture in india is a complex mosaic of distinct agroecosystems differentiated by climatic soil vegetation and other natural features about half of the indians derive their livelihood from agriculture and allied activities it is one of the oldest systems of the world characterized by its diversity and heterogeneity unorganized and stressed on account of natural and anthropogenic vagaries from seed to market historically stressed natural resources due to unfavourable weather monsoon and natural calamities resulted in crop failures leading to food shortage that made serious impacts on the civilization postindependence the indian agriculture transformed from a foodscarce to foodexporting country primarily due to science led innovations that caused multifold increase in the agricultural production from 135 million tons in 195051 to over 1300 million tons in 202122 in spite of increasing abiotic and biotic stresses and depleting alongwith deteriorating natural resources the book indian agriculture after independence portrays the uniqueness diversity vastness and history and captures the aspirations of indian agriculture to develop a roadmap for agrifood system matching with the 4 th industrial revolution and the global commitments on food security nutrition and sustainability the first chapter provides an overview of indian agriculture with its achievements and aspirations the following three chapters detail out the crop and animal husbandry and natural resource management in the preindependent india starting from the vedic to british period the subsequent chapters present the achievements of indian agriculture after independence in the areas of field crops horticulture livestock and poultry fisheries and aquaculture crop and animal health mechanization and postharvest processing natural resources management agricultural education and extension as well as policy investment collaboration and organizational leadership the book is an outcome of a sincere exercise by about 60 leading scientists and scienceleaders of icar from a range of disciplines in the course of preparing the book the authors and editors have received help

institute of abiotic stress management baramati maharashtra summary indian agriculture which began around 11000 years before present bp with the domestication of animals and early cultivation of plants has made significant progress over the millennia this found place in the ancient scripts of vedas upanishadas ramayana and mahabharata agriculture in india has been a complex mosaic of distinct agroecosystems differentiated by climatic soil vegetation and other natural features often heterogeneous unorganized and subjected to vagaries from seed to market historically food shortage in preindependent india caused serious impacts as agriculture was monsoondependent and unfavourable rains and natural calamities resulted in crop failures the planning process in the independent india therefore identified agriculture as the most prioritized sector and emphasized that everything can wait but agriculture in spite of the odds of uncertain weather declining soil health increasing atmospheric temperature and emergence of virulent pest and pathogens which are continuing postindependence indian agriculture achieved several landmarks primarily due to scienceled agricultural development the most signifying milestone has been food security that brought confidence and raised the countrys stature globally we must not forget the ill memories of ship to mouth till 1950s it is the toiling work of millions of our farmers scientists and the planners that transformed india from a food deficit country to a food surplus and net food exporter nation the food grain production which was merely 51 million tons mt in 195051 increased over 6 times to over 314 mt in 2022 the country has also become the largest producer of milk pulses and jute and second largest producer of rice wheat cotton fruits and vegetables in the world india is also one of the leading producers of spices fish poultry livestock and plantation crops however indian agriculture continues to battle several intimidating challenges of increasing productivity profitability and resilience at the backdrop of increasing population depleting natural resource base aggravating climate change and reducing farm income we are now reimagining the indian agriculture and prioritized for enhancing farmers income 200 reducing fertilizer use 25 and water use 20 increasing use of renewable energy 50 reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity 45 and rehabilitating degraded land of 26 million ha mha india being a signatory and prominent member of the united nations has several international commitments such as panchamrit and carbon neutrality land degradation neutrality biodiversity conservation regional agricultural development and sustainable development goals sdgs fortunately advances in science have opened new avenues for addressing the challenges and fulfilling the priorities and indian agriculture after independence 2commitments a multipronged strategy with integration diversification intensification customisation farm mechanization value addition and market access are the way forward to realise the full potentials of indian farming with focus on profitable commercialization and export ecosystem approach sustainable agrifood system involving smart farmers and farming postharvest value addition and entrepreneurship engaging youth and women indian council of agricultural research icar and the national agricultural research education and extension system narees are determined to harness the advances of science and technology to infuse pull and push in agriculture for an allround welfare of the society 1 introduction agriculture is the foundation of livelihood civilization culture and heritage of india with a population of 139 billion india is the worlds second most populous country and is projected to become most populous by 202730 leaving china behind it is the 7 th largest country geographically in the world with 328 mha area india has about 160 mha of arable land second largest after the united states of america and experiences all the 15 prominent climates with 46 out of 60 soiltypes that exist on the earth about 50 of its total geographical area is cultivated which ranks it among the top user of the land for agriculture in the more geographically suitable indogangetic plain igp and the deltas of the eastern coast the proportion of cultivated to total geographical area often exceeds 90 indian agriculture one of the oldest systems of the world is diverse heterogeneous unorganized and often subjected to vagaries at various phases from seed to market it is the critical sector of economy for the sustainable and inclusive economic growth of the country the sector engages 496 of the workforce often seasonally underemployed underpaid and accounts for about 17 share in indias gross domestic product gdp indian agriculture began as early as 11000 bp with the domestication of animals and early cultivation of plants as evidenced in the ancient literature the bhagavad gita rig veda and atharva veda contain details on agriculture like crop cultivation manuring classification of herbs and different varieties of plants in ancient india farmers used to start the agricultural practices such as ploughing sowing reaping and harvesting on auspicious days as these were linked with religious customs the rig veda proclaimed that may the ploughshares till our land properly may the ploughmen go happily with the oxen maharshi bhrugu son of maharshi varun observed food is the brahma never speak ill about food never reject the food take an oath to produce plenty of food krishi parashara with two hundred and fortythree verses is the theory of agriculture expounded in manner so as to benefit the farmers similarly vrikshayurveda discusses the science of plant life such as procuring preserving and treating of seeds before planting selection of soil and nourishment and plant protection from internal and external diseases since the beginning of civilization indian agriculture has made significant progress however there has been several periods in indian history when food shortage made serious impacts on civilization in the preindependent india agriculture has been heavily indian agriculture achievements and aspirations 3dependent on climate unfavourable monsoon particularly southwest monsoon causes droughts and crop failure such droughts sometimes in consecutive years led to famines famines in india resulted in more than 30 million deaths over the course of the 18th 19th and early 20th centuries table 1 table 1

bengal famine 1943 23 source adopted from igi 1907 the famous quote of indias first prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehru that everything can wait but agriculture and mahatma gandhis observation that there are people in the world so hungry that god can not appear to them except in the form of bread signifies the importance of agriculture and the priority given to it after independence the beginning happened with grow more food campaign in 1947 which later moved with scientific vigour planners rigour and millions of farmers hard work in the coexistence of uncertainties of weather and declining soil health increasing atmospheric temperature and emergence of more virulent pests and pathogens the scienceled agricultural development transformed india from an acutely foodscarce and food shortage to food sufficient to food surplus and food exporting country the overall food grain production increased from 51 mt in 195051 to over 314 mt in 202122 the production of food grains increased over 6 times horticultural crops by 11 times fish by 18 times milk by 10 times and eggs by 53 times since 195051 thus making a visible impact on the national food and nutritional security pathak and ayyappan 2020 india is today the largest producer of milk pulses and jute and second largest producer of rice wheat cotton fruits and vegetables in the world on account of active efforts and contributions of agricultural scientists it is also one of the leading producers of spices fish poultry livestock and plantation crops the accomplishments are numerous so are the newer challenges the burgeoning population changing economies have raised the demand for diversified quality food indian agriculture after independence 4while the primary production resource base is not only depleting but also deteriorating the cost of applied inputs machines and labour has increased that adversely impacted the profitability consequently farming at times no longer remains an attractive income option and preferred profession added to it growth rate in productivity of many crops has become stagnant and further compounded by the challenges of climate change about 49 of countrys net cultivated area is rainfed and exposed to biotic and abiotic stresses even the areas in the command of those irrigation systems falling exclusively in the rainfed catchments also experience water stress in the event of deficient monsoon flood especially in eastern part of the country has been a regular feature which is now experienced in the driest regions due to change in rainfall pattern in addition frost in northwest heat waves in central and northern parts and cyclone in eastern coast the frequency of which have increased in recent years cause havoc however amongst the few sectors that made impressive progress during past 75 years of india independence agriculture is confidently the one this has been proven time and again when all the sectors fall short agriculture came as saviour the recent performance during global pandemic covid19 is the best testimony in this chapter we discuss about the enormity uniqueness and diversity of indian agriculture major milestones achieved contributions of research and development in these achievements and the emerging challenges to make indian agriculture productive profitable and sustainable 2 unique vast and diversified agriculture in india indian agriculture is as diverse as the country itself it encompasses different agroecosystems based on commonality of climatic soil geological vegetational and other natural features which decide the diversity of habitats variety of crops and livestock that has been developed over the millennia india is one among the earliest regions on earth where settled agriculture began about 11000 years ago the indian region is one of the worlds 8 centres of origin of crop plants about 166 crop species and 320 wild relatives of crops have originated here genetic diversity within each species is also tremendous for example one species of rice has diversified into at least 50000 distinct varieties and one species of mango into over 1000 varieties ranging from the size of a peanut to a small pumpkin india also has the worlds largest diversity of livestock all the worlds eight buffalo breeds are found here more than mere physical adaptation a host of economic cultural religious and survival factors have played a role in this diversification several varieties of rice and other crops for example were grown in many parts of india just for their use during festivals marriages or other auspicious occasions several others were grown for their taste colour or smell and others for their pesticidal or soilfertilization characteristics india is a unique and diverse country its climate varies from humid and dry tropical in the south to temperate alpine in the north it is the home to vast agroecological diversity with 4 out of the 34 global biodiversity hotspots and 15 world wide fund for nature wwf of global 200 ecoregions within the country with only 24 of the worlds land area indian agriculture achievements and aspirations 5the country harbours around 8 of all recorded species including over 45000 plant and 91000 animal species britannica uk as the climate varies across the regions so is the water availability in the country the supply of water for agriculture is highly seasonal and depends mostly on the southwest monsoon and partly on the northeast monsoon in a few southern states the water availability for irrigation also varies greatly for example in the igp region because of the perennial rivers flowing from the himalayas and recharged groundwater adequate water for irrigation is available however the groundwater is depleting rapidly raising concerns about future crop productivity and sustainability contrast is true for peninsular india where highly seasonal rainfall regime lack of perennial water streams and hard rock formations limits the groundwater aquifers recharge adequately india possesses large areas of highly fertile alluvial soils such as in the igp and relatively productive black soils of the deccan plateau and the redtoyellow lateritic soils most of the remainder of the soils are low in fertility overall organic carbon content of indian soils is less than 05 which unfortunately is going down the cropping is rather diverse in the country with about 60 crops grown in some states the number may be even higher if localized cultivated crops are accounted for in the order of area and production rice is the foremost cereal crop of kharif season and wheat of rabi season other important cereals are maize sorghum pearl millet and finger millet another important category of food crop is pulses dominated by chickpea these are the important source of plant protein for most indians the oilseeds that provide edible oil is another important group of crops amongst the 9 oilseed crops soybean rapeseed and mustard and groundnut are the important ones the food and nonfood crops that are used by industries to process and produce finished products include sugarcane cotton jute mesta tobacco tea etc tomato onion and potato top and other green vegetables such as brinjal okra and squashes as well as fruits such as mango banana mandarin orange papaya and melons are nonstaple crops various spices such as chilies turmeric and ginger are cultivated for domestic as well export purposes with a long history and acknowledgement worldwide mahatama gandhi with pt madan mohan malaviya at ndri bangaloreindian agriculture after independence 6animal husbandry is an integral part of indias agricultural system animal genetic resources are nations traditional strength and provide a good option to manage agriculture sector in more profitable and sustainable manner india has the largest bovine population of the world mixed farming of crops and livestock is the predominant farming system in india total livestock population is 536 million in india with 36 constituted by cattle and 20 by buffaloes total milk production in india was 210 mt in the year 202122 with per capita milk availability of nearly 400 g day1 the major portion of the milk produced in india is contributed by small and marginal farmers icar has characterized the livestock population of india in their natural home tracts and registered 197 breeds this includes 50 breeds of cattle 17 breeds of buffaloes 34 breeds of goats 44 breeds of sheep 9 breeds of camel 7 breeds of horses 19 breeds of chicken and 3 breeds of dog fishing is practiced along the entire length of indias coastline and in the reservoirs and lakes the marine and inland fisheries are contributing production of 38 mt and 13 mt respectively major marine fishes include sardine and mackerel whereas the freshwater catches are dominated by carps aquaculture of fish and shrimp is becoming increasingly significant which at present contributes over 90 mt 3 agricultural research in india agriculture is possibly the oldest sector in the country to have research as its core segment there are evidences of research and development in agriculture in the ancient as well medieval period of indian history a detailed account of such agricultural developments in crop husbandry animal husbandry and natural resources management in the pre independent india has been presented in chapters 2 3 and 4 respectively of this book systematic research in the country started with the establishment of imperial council of agricultural research 1929 in delhi which is known today as indian council of agricultural research icar this is the apex body with its headquarters at new delhi for coordinating guiding and managing research and education in agriculture including animal sciences and fisheries the council is an autonomous organisation under the governance of department of agricultural research and education dare ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare government of india established on 16 july 1929 as a registered society under the societies registration act 1860 in pursuance of the report of the royal commission on agriculture icar now has 113 research institutes 74 agricultural universities 4 deemedtobeuniversities 3 central universities and 731 krishi vigyan kendras spread across the country with these icar leads one of the largest national agricultural research and education system nares in the world india has one of the largest agricultural research human resource capitals in the world with approximately 30000 scientists and more than 100000 technical supporting personnel in the nares icar footprints are also extended to the neighbouring countries and several international national and regional research organizations and universities are engaged with icar in agricultural research and development additionally private and nongovernmental organizations and farmers themselves have done significant agricultural research in their own fieldsindian agriculture achievements and aspirations 74 landmark achievements in indian agriculture in the year 195051 for which the data of agricultural production of majority of the commodities are available by the authorized sources we have been producing about 135 mt from agriculture and allied sectors in 202122 total production of food and nonfood items was about 1300 mt this achievement is one amongst the very few noticeable landmarks in the history of independent india there has been multifold increase in the production of all the commodities in spite the net sown area remaining almost constant at about 140 mha the country has witnessed a rainbow revolution in the agricultural commodities fig 1 green crop white milk blue fish yellow oil golden hort honeysilver egg brown cof fee gray w ool fig 1 revolutions in indian agriculture india now is one of the largest agriproducers globally ranking within the top 5 countries these have enabled not only selfsufficiency in food but also export of agricommodities worth us 50 billion production of most of the agricultural commodities has increased by 6 to 68 times with only 13 times increase in area table 2 thus the country which was food scarce till 1950 transformed itself into food shortage by 1960 food sufficient by 2000 food secured by 2010 and food surplus by 2010 onwards fig 2 during the ongoing covid19 pandemic situation also food production systems have been meeting the demands with innovative interventions across the value chain there are also indications that the greenhouse gas ghg emission intensity in agriculture is reducing and fertilizer use efficiency is improving in recent years pathak and ayyappan 2020 a blend of science technology extension and policy has contributed in this journey of transforming the country from food scarce to food surplus nation the milestone achievements of indian agriculture are briefly presented in the subsequent sections and in table 3

production of sugar oilseed pulses and other crops thus making a visible impact on the national food security the term green revolution was coined by william gaud of usaid in 1968 and the same year the government of india commemorated it by issuing a postal stamp fig 3 the introduction development and widespread adoption of semidwarf photoinsensitive inputresponsive and high yielding varieties of wheat and rice brought an unprecedented transformation in the national agricultural economy and food security technology was the driver of the green revolution as about 80 of the production gains were attributed to yield enhancements the intensified efforts in oilseed crop research post technology mission on oilseeds tmo in 1986 resulted in yellow revolution with a quantum jump in edible oil production from 108 mt 198586 to 247 mt 199899 just in a decade period from 1985 to 1996 area under oilseed cultivation increased from 190 to 260 mha to achieve similar boost in pulses production they were brought under tmo in 1991 the continued efforts for about three decades in pulses brought pulse revolution by providing near selfsufficiency in pulses in the late 2010s yadav et al 2019 the production of pulses which remained almost constant at 1415 mt till 201415 jumped to 2572 mt 202021 india also witnessed sugar revolution with sugarcane production increased from 5705 mt 195051 to 40542 mt 201920 in independent india 115 improved varieties have been developed which helped in the steady increase of sugarcane production with improved sugar recovery icar has released more than

developed a portable soil test kitmini laboratory called indian agriculture achievements and aspirations 19mridaparikshak to supplement soil testing service in the country agriculture consumes over 80 of the fresh water for irrigation water resource management therefore took the central stage immediately after the independence with the initiation of major and medium irrigation projects enhancing onfarm water use efficiency and rainwater harvesting are the core activities on which the council has heavily embarked upon while several insitu water conservation and management practices have been developed and deployed for the benefit of the farmers in the past more recent development of regional crop plans for efficient water management has been taken up icar 2021 the drip fertigation for higher water and nutrient use efficiency and integrated farming system ifs models for augmenting farm productivity and income of small and marginal farmers have also been developed more than 65 multienterprise ifs models have been demonstrated in various agroclimatic zones of the country a rubber dam technology for water harvesting in micro watersheds and microrain water harvesting structure jalkund for northeast region with storage capacity of 30000 litres have been developed global climatic changes are already adversely affecting crops soils water biodiversity livestock and fisheries agriculture contributes to the global warming primarily through the emission of methane and nitrous oxide based on very limited measurements done elsewhere it was reported in 1990 that indian rice fields emit 375 mt methane per year with systematic indigenous research the methane emission estimate was rationalized to 33 mt per year and a detailed inventory of greenhouse gas emission from indian agriculture was prepared pathak 2015 the estimate provided strength to the riceproducing developing countries for global negotiations on climate change infocrop a crop simulation model for tropical environments has been developed to assess the impacts of climate change and optimize the input use for higher efficiency and lower emission several mitigation and adaptation technologies for climate resilient agriculture has been developed which will help the country to attain net zero emission and carbon neutrality to fulfils indias commitment to the united nations under nicra national innovation on climate resilient agriculture project a vulnerability atlas of the country has been prepared and 446 climatefriendly villages in 151 clusters have been developed which will be upscaled

achievements in agricultural extension are presented in chapter 14 49 national and international collaborations collaborations in research with national and international agencies have major role in shaping the path for agricultural development in india the collaboration with cimmyt and irri for exchange of dwarf wheat and rice varieties respectively triggered the efforts for the green revolution making india food secure the icarcgiar collaborations expanded to various commodities and strategic locations for development of new crop varieties and animal breeds and also managing natural resources development of new breeds by harnessing the potentials of the exotic breeds vaccines and diagnostics quality standards health nutrition and hygiene standards and protocols came out from the international and national collaborations in livestock and fisheries sector the bilateral cooperation in agricultural rd extended to all continents touching to 65 nations in 2020 21 india as a founder member of saarc brics bimstec shaped the agricultural regional cooperation with member nations india made an impressive footprint in its neighbourhood through the establishment of anastu in afghanistan acare in myanmar deemed university for agricultural education in nepal more information on national and international collaborations are presented in chapter 15 410 policy innovations the agricultural transformation in india from food deficit to food surplus in the past 75 years has seen many bold and dynamic policy interventions immediately after the independence the establishment of saus on the land grant pattern of the usa was the policy milestone that resulted into one of the largest agricultural research systems in the world imports of seed of dwarf varieties of rice and wheat was another policy decision in 1964 onwards that helped furthering the crop sciences in the country the policies related to regulations and facilitation of germplasm exchange helped new seeds and planting materials for the research system several acts and institutions came into being modified and remodified with the passage of time to attract scientific research in agriculture promote public and private investment and facilitate the farmers and others involved in and for indian agriculture achievements and aspirations 23agriculture the cooperative societies act passed in 1904 and its subsequent reforms for credit support to the farmers was a major milestone postindependence several state owned commodity institutions were brought under icar to reorient and refocus their strength for national and regional aspirations the input and technology intensive green revolution accelerated the need for financial support for agriculture in the year 1974 the commercial banks were advised to raise the share of the priority sectors including agriculture in their aggregate advances to the level of 333 another landmark policy decision that helped technology reaching directly to farmers by the technology evolver was taken in 1974 for the establishment of kvks which were later broadened to at least one in each district of the country further efforts were done by attaching each district with a commercial lead bank the commission for agricultural costs prices cacp and the food corporation of india fci were established to assist the farmers with price support operations and ensure the productivity gains reaching the consuming sector through the public distribution system pds in the year 1982 the national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard was established to undertake the agricultural credit related functions of the reserve bank of india public institutions both at the centre and states have helped in minimizing risks and costs of inputs used for higher profit realizations subsidies and waivers have been the prime instruments for providing such benefits to the farmers the other institutional intervention to support farmers has been the direct income transfer through the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi pmkisan scheme along with enhancing food production the export promotion and import substitution are the focus through local to global and one district one product initiatives the council has identified processable and highyielding varieties of various crops and fruits matching with the consumer preference and markets to enhance the export of potential commodities icar 2021 the rise of new generation entrepreneurs or startups since last decade led by innovative ideas to solve the problems along with ethical business practices are playing in profound ways agriculture and allied sector have been witnessing emergence of several startups commonly termed as agristartups which help developing products and services to bring efficiency in the value chain many of these startups are using new generation it tools like artificial intelligence ai internet of things iot imaging sensors remote sensing drone data analytics blockchain technology etc in agriculture and allied sector for improving yield efficiency and profitability icar has established 50 agribusiness incubators since 2016 and supported 1476 startupsentrepreneursincubates during 201420 the details of investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem for agricultural development have been presented in chapter 16 5 emerging challenges with the expected population of over 16 billion and annual food demand of 400 mt by 2050 the country requires minimum 4 annual growth in agriculture the changing macro and microeconomies will also impact the demand and behavioral changes for food there would be substantial increase in demand for quality products of fruitsvegetables and livestock the dietary pattern of eating less with bioenriched quality food could be another major shift the challenges of environment protection and globalization shall put indian agriculture after independence 24tremendous pressure on indian agriculture climate change induced impacts on agricultural productivity is the most imminent of such challenges the temperature is rising and becoming highly variable amount intensity variability and extreme events of rainfall are rising while the duration of rainfall is reducing perceptible negative impacts are projected on production of food grains livestock as well as aquatic systems both quantitatively and qualitatively sustainable intensification of land resources is inevitable for food security of increasing population india has 121 mha ie 36 of the geographical area degraded with soil erosion salinity alkalinity acidity water logging and other edaphic stresses with 4 of worlds renewable water resources the country has only 43 mha fully irrigated 23 mha partially irrigated and 74 mha rainfed in the recent past both drought and floods have been seen to be stress factors in farming indias rechargeable annual groundwater potential is around 432 billion cubic metres bcm with over 90 utilised in some parts of the country as can be seen from the depletion of the groundwater table in several states of punjab haryana parts of rajasthan gujarat western uttar pradesh as also in the deccan plateau with multiple activities on the land resource including farming practices nutrient deficiencies of different kinds are being increasingly reported annually 810 mt of npk is mined from soil and 93 91 51 and 43 soils are rated low in nitrogen phosphorus potassium and zinc respectively fertilizers therefore have played a crucial role in enhancing crop production and globally 120 mt of n fertilizer is used in agriculture while in india the consumption is about 17 mt annually however nearly half of the fertiliser n applied is leaked into the environment through volatilization leaching or emissions resulting in multiple adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic systems and on human health these concerns need to be addressed through combinations of crop varieties reclamation measures and cultivation practices enabled by emerging technologies and policy interventions 6 way forward india has now several national priorities such as enhancing farmers income 200 reducing fertilizer use 25 and water use 20 increasing renewable energy use 50 reducing ghg emission intensity 45 and rehabilitating degraded land 26 mha to achieve at the same time being a signatory and prominent and responsible member of the united nations and other global organizations it has several international commitments to fulfil such as panchamrit and c neutrality unfccc land degradation neutrality unccd biodiversity conservation uncbd regional agricultural development saarc and sustainable development goals un the way forward for indian agriculture therefore should focus on precision agriculture reducing chemical footprints naturefriendly farming use of nanofertilizers with more synergy in crop weather and water cycles and crop planning using ecosystem approaches fortunately along with challenges the developments in science are creating new avenues for tackling the challenges and fulfilling the priorities and commitments for timely monitoring of weather plant and soil indicators and provide artificial intelligencebased advisory to farmers icar initiated a network programme on precision agriculture research on agricultural genomics indian agriculture achievements and aspirations 25would be one of the core research activities which has made substantial progress in the past the icar and the nares at large are determined to harness the advances of science for the welfare of society the council is committed to transform itself into an organization engaged fully with the farmers industry entrepreneurs and consumers a multipronged strategy with integration diversification clustering customised farm mechanisation value addition and market access is required to realise the full potentials of farming developing varieties tolerant to multiple abiotic and biotic stresses using stresstolerant qtls genes and alleles in elite cultivars is an efficient way of achieving higher yields and sustainability methods and tools for conserving storing and enhancing water use efficiency through pressurized low cost and demanddriven microirrigation systems need to be upscaled to horticultural and field crops application of neemcoated urea well calibrated according to soil health card and leaf colour charts should become common practices for enhancing fertilizer use efficiency microbebased technologies for nitrogen fixation nutrient recycling bioresidue management and alleviation of abiotic and biotic stresses have also been found useful the conservation agriculture beyond the irrigated ecosystem should prolifically be used to reduce the carbon footprint of production systems development and deployment of smart small machines using renewable energy sources and solarpowered water pumps sprayers and weeders should get more momentum greater thrust is needed with regard to agriinfrastructure both during the production and postharvest phases the latter in terms of processing and storage facilities the focus should be on export orientation ecosystem approach sustainable food system smart farming postharvest value addition and entrepreneurship engaging youth and women a twoway digital communication between the farmers and scientists should be the new paradigm of technology delivery system 7 conclusion ensuring food and nutritional security improving rural livelihood along with environmental security in a sustainable manner will remain the major goal of the agricultural development planning india will strive to help achieve these goals through development of improved agricultural technologies along with their efficient and effective modes of dissemination it is estimated that the annual growth in the productivity of food grains should be more than 15 and that of horticultural crops more than 3 to meet this goal this will essentially require development of improved varieties of field and horticultural crops with desirable traits under the changing environmental scenario at the same time technology will also be needed to increase the input use efficiency to reduce the cost of production and enhanced value addition to make indian agriculture profitable competitive and attractive to rural youth in addition value addition through processing will help in reducing colossal losses on one hand and increase the income of the farmers on the other icar is ready to take up the challenges with focused research programs keeping in mind the recent developments in science and technology changed economic environment and opportunities at national and international arenas for higher productivity profitability

27 2 chapter crop husbandry in preindependent india ashok kumar singh firoz hossain and rajarshi roy burman icarindian agricultural research institute new delhi summary agriculture was the mainstay of generating food in ancient india during the prevedic indus valley popularly known as harappan civilization cultivation of wheat barley mustard chickpea cotton dates lotus coconut pomegranate lemon and melon was a common practice in the vedic era early aryans preferred the cultivation of barley as their homeland food they initially did not know of rice but later came to know of its existence when they expanded their territory to northern india both cultivated and wild rice were cultivated during the neolithic culture diverse cereals millets pulses oilseeds vegetables spices and fruits were grown during the rule of different dynasties the portuguese introduced new crops like groundnut potato chili and tobacco during the mughal era special emphasis was given to grow dry fruits and fragrant flowers in the british period improved agronomic practices like crop rotations and inter and mixed cropping were followed the british also introduced several fruits vegetables and other commercially important crops agricultural research and education institutions and programmes were initiated during the period and contributed to address the agrarian challenges helped in developing trained human resources and provided a basis for the modernday agricultural system in india 1 introduction cultivation of crops through agricultural practices has been the major source of food to the evergrowing population in the modern era improved cultivars across crops have been developed through integration of genetics breeding and biotechnological tools these cultivars possess resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses and are rich in nutritional qualities however in the ancient time people used the hunting and gathering method to fulfill the need of energy and nutrition and had to move through a large area to have the continuous supply of food later families and largergroups built communities and had a transition from the nomadic lifestyle to cultivation of crops through agricultural practices initial agricultural system started with domestication followed by introduction of crops in the new areas agriculture in the indian subcontinent began way back in 9000 bc however more information of crop cultivation could be obtained from the indus valley or harappan civilization systematic information on crops is available in the vedas the writings by various famous travelers and writers during the rule of different dynasties also provided information of crops which had been part of the contemporary agricultural system the indian agriculture after independence 28portuguese travellers introduced many new crops to india agriculture became a key interest area during the british rule in india that followed with the establishment of various institutions that later formed the base for modern agricultural research and education system in india development of improved crop cultivars through sciencebased selection approach was also initiated during the british rule the present chapter systematically presents the details of cultivation of various crop species and agricultural practices used during the prevedic and vedic era followed by rules of different dynasties and british in preindependence india 2 crop husbandry in the prevedic era agriculture began as early as 9000 bc in the indian subcontinent and crops like wheat barley and jujube were domesticated during that time however information on cultivation of crops as part of the agricultural system became more vivid during the indus valley civilization popularly known as harappan civilization which flourished during 2300 1600 bc in western punjab and sind province of the indian subcontinent the excavation by dr sahni in ad 1921 at harappa and rd banerjee in ad 1923 at mohenjodaro discovered two major cities with rich cultural heritage the harappan culture eventually spread to eastern punjab western uttar pradesh rajasthan western madhya pradesh and gujarat the excavation revealed wheat and barley cultivation as part of their agricultural system among various species of wheat grains of triticum aestivum t compactum and t spherococcum were recovered from the mohenjodaro site barley grains of hordeum vulgare var nudum and h vulgare var hexastichum were also found at mohenjodaro and harappa respectively both the crops being originated in central asia it was concluded that indus valley civilization had contacts with the mesopotamian civilization among pulses chickpea grains were recovered from the harappan site and sesame amongst oilseeds possibly introduced from africa or mesopotamia was also cultivated during harappan civilization the seeds of mustard brassica juncea were also recovered from chanudaro site indicating its cultivation in sind a small fragment of cotton cloth collected from mohenjodaro suggested that indus valley civilization was the earliest to spin and wove cotton fibres the fibre quality depicted that those were similar to coarse indian cotton species like gossypium arboreum and g herbaceum cotton cloths produced by the harappans were used as the main export materials with mesopotemian civilization in exchange of silver and woollen garments among fruits evidence of availability of seeds and fruits suggested the cultivation of date lotus coconut pomegranate lemon and melons during harappan civilization neolithic culture existed as early as 2300 bc six geographical places viz northwestern region of pakistan baluchistan swat and upper sind valley northern regions kashmir and kangra region in himachal pradesh centraleastern chota nagpur plateau and surrounding regions of uttar pradesh bihar orissa and west bengal northeastern assam chittagong and subhimalayan region including darjeeling north bihar saran crop husbandry in preindependent india 29and southern peninsular region especially andhra pradesh and karnataka of india have the evidence of neolithic cultures the evidence from excavation of burzahom site in kashmir revealed weed seeds and suggested the possibility of wheat and barley crops in the northern neolithic culture in the southern peninsular region the evidence at hallur karnataka suggested that ragi 1800 bc was a crop of choice among pulses grains of horse gram 17801500 bc were collected from tekkalakota karnataka the grains recovered from maharashtra also suggested the cultivation of various minor millets the evidence collected from navdatoli in tamil nadu described that green gram black gram 1500 bc and lentil 1500 bc were cultivated as agricultural crops besides sorghum among millets linseed and castor among oilseeds and ber and amla among fruits were also cultivated in eastern regions evidence of cultivation of both cultivated rice oryza sativa and wild rice o rufipogon wheat barley pea and green gram were found at chirand bihar evidence from pandu rajar dhibi in west bengal also confirmed that rice was a popular choice of food besides banana sugarcane and yam were also cultivated the evidence of cultivation of rice in india dates back to 2300 bc at lothal gujarat rangpur gujarat 20001800 bc chirand bihar 20001300 bc pandu rajar dhibi west bengal 20001001 bc navdatoli tamil nadu 15501400 bc hastinapur 1100800 bc and atranjikhera 1200600 bc in uttar pradesh the first evidence of growing of jowar was found in ahar rajasthan during 1725 bc 3 crop husbandry in the vedic era aryans occupied area of eastern afghanistan northwest frontier province kashmir punjab and parts of sind and rajasthan the land was named as saptasindhavah after seven rivers viz sutlej beas ravi chenab jhelum indus and sarasvati flowing through the most fertile land during the early vedic era 15001000 bc the rigveda the oldest book of the aryans mentioned barley white and black coloured sesame sugarcane cucumber and bottle gourd though harappans grew wheat and cotton early aryans possibly did not grow them and stuck to barley as their homeland food rice finds no mention in the early vedic literature they came to know about rice after they expanded their territory to uttar pradesh and bihar during the later vedic periods 1000600 bc vedic literatures like samaveda yajurveda and atharvaveda were composed mahabharata and ramayana were also written during this period the cultivated and wild rice barley wheat maize bajra foxtail millet proso millet barnyard millet kidney beans lentils sesame and coix have found their mention in these literatures generally two crops were grown during the year the earliest evidence of growing bajra has been found from rangpur gujarat during 1100800 bc a clear mention of sowing of barley during winter season and maturity in summer is made while rice planting in rainy season with harvesting in autumn season beans and sesame were grown during the onset of summer rain and harvested during the colder months in winter cucumber was also possibly cultivated during the time indian agriculture

pulpy rice being the staple food indicated that rice was their preferred cereal crop mauryan dynasty ruled during 322232 bc the arthashastra mentioned that the crops like rice and sesame were sown early while green gram and black gram were planted in the middle of the season with safflower lentil barley linseed and mustard being late crops it also mentioned that rice was easy to grow while vegetables had intermediate difficulties with sugarcane being the most exhaustive crop due to the requirement of utmost care and expenditure besides heavy pest incidence during ashoka s rule 274237 bc banana mango jack fruit grape and date were cultivated during 200 bc to ad 200 various dynasties like sungas satvahanas and kushans ruled the coconut cultivation was popular in the coastal states due to its multiple usage as copra oil oilcake and fibre pandyas cheras and cholas ruled different parts of southern india during first century of the christian era to ad 300 ragi sugarcane pepper turmeric and cotton were cultivated during this period along with the use of various forest products like bamboo rice and jack fruit the mention of red rice yellow rice and hogs rice during the rule

of hiuen tsang mentioned a special rice variety having large seeds as black bean with strong aroma various fruits like amla chestnut loquat pear wild plum peach apricot grape pomegranate and sweet oranges were grown in plenty ginger mustard melons and pumpkins were also grown with onion and garlic being cultivated in limited areas chalukyas rashtrakutas pallavas pandyas hoysalas and kakatiyas ruled southern india during ad 5351300 during this period rice cultivation was extended to various areas indian agriculture after independence 32with irrigation facilities available and millets were restricted to rainfed areas of deccan and mysore plateau besides sugarcane sesame ginger pumpkin yam mango coconut and jackfruit were cultivated throughout the regions various rajput rulers ruled north india during ad 6501155 while palas and senas in bengal during ad 7601205 in lexicons written in sanskrit eight varieties of rice different in colours fragrance size and growing periods have been mentioned magadha was famous for rice while rice was part of kings dietary in kalinga the seven varieties of beans have also been mentioned in those literature coconut ginger and cinnamon were grown in plenty cotton and indigo were also in cultivation in different kingdoms the writings of medhaitithi parashara kashyapa and early arabs mentioned in some details the agricultural practices followed during ad 9001100 their scripts mentioned that mango coconut lemons and rice were grown in large quantities while sugarcane pepper and bamboo in specific areas kashyapa provided the explicit details of transplanting weeding irrigation crop protection measures harvesting threshing selection of seeds and storage of rice cultivation the unique quality of pundra sugarcane in producing juice

spices turmeric ginger and cardamom vegetables brinjal cucurbits and gourd and fruits date coconut mango and jamun during their time the islamic empire delhi sultanate stretched over large parts of the indian subcontinent during 12061526 ibn battuta had a detailed mention of crops grown during this period the people grew crops twice a year one with the arrival of rain during summer and the other during spring rice millets green gram and black gram were grown during the summer season and harvested after 60 days during autumn season wheat barley chickpea and lentils were grown during the spring season ibn battuta also mentioned that people in the indian subcontinent grew rice the principal cereal crop three times a year and sugarcane and sesame during the summer season with onset of rain when he left for southern states he found abundance of pepper ginger sugarcane coconut and betel vine cultivation in kerala and rice in bengal mahaum a chinese scholar visited bengal in 1604 also mentioned the abundance of rice wheat millets pulses mustard sesame ginger onion squash brinjal hemp jack fruit mango pomegranate sugarcane and betel nut in bengal vijayanagar empire 13361646 emerged after the control of tughlak empire receded during this period rice wheat jowar barley beans green gram and horse gram amongst field crops and sweet and sour orange wild brinjal pomegranate and grapes amongst fruits were cultivated portuguese introduced new american and african crop plants to india through sea routes that moved through portugal to brazil to cape of good hope to goa in india 1510 many plants of malay archipelago and east indies were also introduced groundnut was amongst the many crops introduced by them tobacco was also introduced by them during the closing years of reigns of akbar potato was imported to europe from chile and peru during 15801585 by the spaniards and english travelers the portugues introduced chilli crop husbandry in preindependent india 33to india from brazil or peru in the 16th century and potato in the 17th century from chile or peru amaranth was introduced by them into malabar from brazil besides chestnut guava sharifa chiku and pineapple were also introduced by them they also brought in ornamental plants like agave and allamanda another significant contribution by them was the introduction of grafting technique in about 1550 it was restricted to goa for nearly two centuries and in about 1790 the grafting technique spread to the rest of india 5 crop husbandry during the mughal era the rule of mughals started with the invasion of babur in 1526 babur mentioned in his memoirs the baburnama various crops like mango banana tamarind mahua jamun chironji jack fruit ber amla lime orange date palm coconut and toddy palm he also mentioned availability of some of the beautiful flowers like oleander gurhal keora and white jasmine babur is credited to introduce scented persian rose to india akbar ruled the mughal empire during 15551605 information on ainiakbari written by akbars court historian abul fazl and various european travellers gave great details of crops flowers and fruits grown during akbars rule these literatures mentioned that wheat was predominant in the north west part of india while barley and chickpea were grown throughout the country however cultivation of rice was restricted in bengal orissa uttar pradesh lahore khandesh berar and kashmir the book also mentioned that rice in bengal was cultivated three times a year jowar bajra and other types of millets were grown especially in the north western regions having limited rainfall among pulses chickpea lentil pea green gram black gram and arhar were prominent sesame linseed toria mustard and safflower were the oilseed crops grown during that time besides sugarcane cotton hemp indigo poppy betel nut melons gourds pumpkin and tobacco were also cultivated saffron was cultivated in kashmir abul fazl mentioned that bengal recorded the highest sugarcane production he also stated that three kinds of sugarcane viz paunda black and ordinary were grown in the southern part of the country rice wheat jowar ragi green gram horse gram coconut ginger turmeric cardamom and arecanut were plenty in cultivation malabar was famous for growing various spices viz cardamom ginger pepper nutmeg cloves and cinnamon abul fazl mentioned that akbar was interested in garden plants and he mentioned the name of 21 flowering plants along with their colours and season of flowering in ainiakbari he further mentioned another list of 29 flowering plants and some of them were champa kewra saffron juhi gulal ketki gudhal nag kesar kadam and hinna among fruit crops mulberries pineapple ber jack fruit figs melon banana date palm pomegranate guava and water melons are some of the important crops grown during akbars rule mango was specially grown in bengal gujarat malwa khandesh and dekhan mention of various dried fruits dates and walnuts and water plants singhara was also found abul fazl elaborated a list of 18 vegetables of which palwals gourds and carrots are important in ainiakbari there is mention of sackcloth which later was identified as jute from rangpur bengal jahangir ruled the indian subcontinent during 16051627 and during his time melons mango grapes and pineapples were found indian agriculture after independence 34in abundance he also mentioned the presence of sweet fragrant flowers like champa keora ketaki and chambeli nurjahan mother of jahangir was credited to develop itr the extract of essential oils from the rose petals during the time of shah jahan 1628 1658 improved varieties of cherry peach plum and grapes were introduced from persia and afghanistan 6 crop husbandry in the british period east india company came to india for trade established its rule on large areas of india after the battle of plassey in 1757 which lasted until 1858 in 1858 the british crown assumed direct control of india in the form of the new british raj which lasted till 1947 until the middle of the 18th century only indigenous cotton varieties g arboreum and g herbaceum were grown in different regions of the country due to the human skills and dexterity of the local artisans very fine yarns were produced by them from the short staple and coarse cottons grown in india in 1788 the governor general at calcutta was requested by london to encourage the growth and improvement of indian cotton to meet the requirements of the lancashire textile industry although the exact area under indigenous cotton and production in india during this period are not available it is reported that the local production had stabilized by 1900 the jowar bajra and other millets maize cooked and eaten as a green vegetable and rice were cultivated during the wet season and wheat barley and pulses during the dry season greater proportion of the indigo consumed in europe was produced in india it was grown extensively from dhaka to delhi its culture extended over 10 lakh acres in the gangetic region in 1842 the total export from india was valued at 27 lakh the trade in opium was a government monopoly sugarcane was a popular crop among the indian farmers and it was also exported to the united kingdom in large quantities the wheat yield in india varied with the conditions under which the crop was grown for example on unmanured and low rainfeddry crop it produced 7 bushels per acre whereas 10 bushels per acre on manured land with better rainfall and 1525 bushels per acre on manured with irrigated land after the construction of the suez canal in 1869 the export of oilseeds increased from 2 million to 5 million in a period of 19 years the principal oil seeds were castor gingelly sesame groundnut safflower rape mustard niger linseed and cotton seed the seeds of the fruits of several trees such as pongamia glabra mahua and neem tree were also used for oil extraction and the trash was used as manure and cattle feed the major spices were ginger saffron cardamom pepper cocoa areca and other palm yielding nuts which were extensively consumed by the native population the principal indigenous fruits were mango the finest of all the indian fruits pomegranate citron date almond grape pineapple and tamarind in the northern provinces apple pear plum apricot and other european fruits were grown orange and lemon were also grown by the farmers pepper was an important product of the malabar coast and the import into crop husbandry in preindependent india 35the united kingdom from british india in 1849 amounted to 3913611 pounds silk was produced primarily in bengal and assam the mulberry thrived so freely in india that its culture expanded greatly beyond its present amount 61 crops introduced by the british driven by their trade interests the british made efforts to introduce new crops institutes and systems in indian agriculture during the 18th and 19th centuries setting up of the royal botanical gardens and the botanical survey of india to acclimatize exotic crops of commercial importance to indian conditions were some of them pseudo cereals like oat grain legumes like black bean fibre crops like cotton vegetables like beetroot cauliflower sweet pepper squash carrot orange lettuce tomato pea fruits like papaya strawberry apple apricot cherry plum peach and pear medicinal crops like quinine and aromatic plants like poppy and vanilla were also introduced 62 crops rotation and mixed cropping indian farmers used to practice crop rotation and also followed mixed cropping often millets like jowar were sown mixed with leguminous crops like arhar rice was cultivated as a sole crop on siltrenewed lands that needed little or no manure and which were plentifully supplied with water differences in the mode of cultivating rice was followed in some parts of bengal where it was the rule to sow rice broadcasted one year and transplanted in the next in the bombay presidency crops were systematically rotated in the irrigated garden less attention was paid to the rotation of purely dry crops the reason was that everywhere on dry crop land the practice of mixed cropping prevailed and the practice avoided to some extent the necessity of other rotation 63 trading and export of agricommodities the british indian agricultural products cotton indigo opium and rice emerged as major commodities of global trade the production of the more commercialized crops like indigo and opium tended to be restricted the second half of the nineteenth century however saw significant expansion of land under cultivation in new crops that emerged as major exportable such as cotton and wheat a steady rise in yield per acre was seen national income estimates confirmed that agricultural production expanded in the late nineteenth century at the average rate of about 1 per year due to increasing area under cultivation and the wasteland made cultivable by canal irrigation large scale expansion in cropped area usually involved the relocation of capital and labour on a large scale as well important regions of agrarian expansion were the punjab the narmada valley western part of the united provinces and coastal andhra from 18911946 the annual growth rate of all crop output was 04 and foodgrain output was practically stagnant there were significant regional and inter crop differences however nonfood crops did better than food crops bengal had belowaverage growth rates in both food and nonfood crop output whereas punjab and madras were the least stagnant regions agricultural prices experienced indian agriculture after independence 36pronounced cycles in the first half of the nineteenth century but from the third quarter began to rise steadily and significantly until around 1920 for example the price of wheat in 1920 was roughly increased three times to its 1870 level the expansion of the global economy and greater overseas demand for primary commodities accounted for the relatively greater rise in prices of exportable food grains as compared to other commodities in the inter war period population growth accelerated while food output decelerated leading to declining availability of food per head the crisis was the most acute in bengal where food output declined at an annual rate of about 07 from 19211946 when population grew at an annual rate of about 1 64 institutionalization of agricultural research and education in the second half of the 19th century started the talk of effecting large scale improvements in indian agriculture all this talk merely led to the establishment of a few experimental farms and some agricultural schools a fundamental department of agriculture in india was started in 1871 although the chief function of the department named department of revenue agriculture and commerce remained revenue and there was no work on agricultural development plantation research in colonial india though the experimental farms were established in 1884 the provincial agricultural departments could seldom go beyond the collection of revenue data and famine relief operations primarily the department was established by the government with a view to supply cotton to the textile industries of manchester and not to feed the famineravished india based on the reports of the famine commissions of 1880 1898 and 1900 the government was determined to set up a central department of agriculture controlled by the imperial secretariat and agriculture departments were to be set up in the provinces to primarily look after agricultural enquiry agricultural development and famine relief in the country indian agricultural research institute at pusa biharcrop husbandry in preindependent india 37however the key duty of the agriculture departments both in the center and the provinces lingered on famine relief in 1892 an agricultural chemist and an assistant chemist were allotted to look after research and teaching in india which manifested the first scientific staff in the department of revenue and agriculture eventually in 1901 an inspector general of agriculture was appointed to advise the imperial and the provincial governments on agricultural matters an imperial mycologist was appointed in the same year and an entomologist was appointed in 1903 during the severe famines of 18991900 lord curzon the then viceroy of india was convinced that the government must urgently concentrate on the agricultural sector to overcome the damages caused by frequent famines as a consequence the agriculture research institute together with a college for advanced agriculture training was established at pusa bihar in 1905 and its director was the agriculture adviser to the government till 1929 the agricultural school at saidapet chennai which was established as early as 1868 was later relocated to coimbatore during 1906 likewise a branch for teaching agriculture in the college of science at pune established in 1879 was subsequently developed into a separate college of agriculture in 1907 similarly agricultural colleges were established at kanpur sabour nagpur and lyallpur now in pakistan between 1901 and 1905 systematic research was initiated at the agriculture research institute pusa bihar for developing improved cultivars of major crops the importance of strength of straw in wheat cultivation was mentioned in the reports another limiting factor in the growth of wheat in india was temperature it used to be too hot during the sowing of wheat and also advent of the hot weather in spring checked ripening and the crop withered research was undertaken to overcome these limitations and breeding programmes successfully brought out wheat varieties like pusa4 which had a good plant stand in spite of rain and wind it was of shorter duration and used to be sown in first week of november and harvested in early march pusa12 was the first wheat variety released through hybridization breeding in 1910 while pusa4 was adjudged as the best quality wheat in 1911 dr benjamin peary pal commenced the rust resistance breeding programme in wheat at tutikandi shimla and pusa bihar the pusa wheat varieties varied considerably in their degree of resistance to rust diseases the most resistant wheat varieties were pusa52 and pusa4 while the most susceptible cultivars were pusa12 and pusa 805 pusa111 was fixed from a natural cross in pusa4 but was more resistant to rust than pusa4 breeding programmes of oat and barley were also undertaken for developing high yielding and early maturing varieties selections in oats viz 121 and 191 were found very promising and termed as bs type 1 and bs type 2 respectively barley constituted one of the main cereal crops of northern india and a number of pure line strains were isolated b4 became the highest yielding cultivar during the time tobacco research was also undertaken during colonial period tobacco variety type 28 pusa28 became very popular among indian states during 19161920 with about 12000 acres of cultivation each year the area under tobacco was suddenly increased by manifold with about 50000 acres under cultivation in 1921 successful trials of type 28 variety of tobacco were also made indian agriculture after independence 38by indian leaf tobacco development company in bihar the company also undertook trials of pusa28 in british east africa kenya and zanzibar considerable progress was made in the isolation and study of linseed crop as well the study of inheritance of various characters in linseed was undertaken type 124 of linseed gave higher yield compared to type 12 and type 121 commercial possibilities of safflower oil were also explored gram was another important crop in which breeding programmes successfully brought out promising genotypes named pusa17 and pusa18 which gave higher yields compared to the local genotypes iari now indian agricultural research institute at pusa bihar was later shifted to new delhi in 1936 sugarcane breeding in colonial india continued to give promising varieties a new sugarcane variety co 290 released from coimbatore in 1924 superior to co 213 had proved suitable for all sugarcane growing areas it was reported that in 192627 the area under coimbatore canes in north india was estimated at 23600 acres and the increased profit to cane growers placed at rs 1450000 in 192728 the area increased to one lakh acres with more than proportional increase in profits in case of rice geb 24 was the first rice variety released through an official breeding programme in 1921 in 1933 basmati 370 was identified from a large collection of basmati rice cultivars grown all over the north western india an allindia board of agriculture was established in 1905 with a view to bring the provincial governments more in touch with one another and make suitable recommendations to the government the indian agriculture service was constituted in 1906 the royal commission on agriculture linlithgow commission which was appointed in 1926 authoritatively reviewed the position of agriculture in india and reported the same in 1928 according to the proposal of the royal commission on agriculture the department of education health and lands of the government set up the imperial council of agricultural research now icar on 16 july 1929 several semiautonomous central commodity committees were set up by the ministry of food and agriculture the indian central cotton committee was the first one to be established in 1921 on the recommendation of the indian cotton committee 191718 the chief function of the central cotton committee was cotton improvement with special focus on the development of improved methods of growing and marketing cotton the committees support led to the development of 70 improved varieties and considerably improved fibre quality iari became the premier national institute for agricultural research education and extension in india after independence in 1947 indian council of agricultural research icar steered agricultural research education and extension in postindependent india intensive efforts of the scientists through innovative breeding programmes and suitable crop husbandry agronomic practices coupled with the conducive policies of the government active involvement of extension professionals and farmers resulted in the green revolution in 1960s thereby ensuring food security to the country subsequent achievements in crop improvement and its management are discussed in the subsequent chapters crop

draftpower skin games and recreation sheep and goat were the first domesticated animals in the indian sub continent cattle gained more importance during the vedic period leading to initiation of professional cattle breeding the science of animal ayurveda was also documented in this era while the use of cow dung manure in the agricultural fields was first observed in the iron age later on buffalo was recognized for dairying in the mauryan period horses and elephants received special attention during this period as they were required in battle and transportation their importance can be observed from the fact that specific feeding schedule was followed for horses and there was a ban on killing the elephants for their tusks use of animals for food religious purposes and transport continued in the premughal era dynasties literature of mughal era shows that people by then were aware about the best animal breeds and feed management practices they used oxen for traction and milk as an important ingredient of various cuisines this period is also known for the science related to horse rearing and breeding horse breed improvement followed by scientific developments in the field of cattle rearing and management continued with the advent of colonial rule formal veterinary education establishment of agricultural research institutes setting up of processing plants and development of vaccinestreatments for various animal diseases can be counted as important achievements of the british era 1 introduction animal rearing in india is centuriesold and there are sufficient evidences that suggest domestication of farm animals happened even before the beginning of the written history all these stages of mananimal relationship from the prehistoric time to early historic time are depicted in the art of the cave dwellers mathpal 1984 ancient indian literature vedas puranas brahmanas epics do mention about animal care and disease management it is believed that mananimal relationship or domestication was initiated during mohenjodaro and harappa period of indus valley civilization domestication of animals started simultaneously at around 2500 bc in certain places of northern india excavations from the bronze age civilization revealed animal husbandry practices including care and indian agriculture after independence 42management of various types of livestock species including bovines small ruminants elephants poultry etc early historic man confined animals particularly to usemisuse them during battles humped cattle breeding was more depicted during the rig vedic period 15001000 bc the cow was then called kamdhenu the one who fulfils all daily needs deriving its meaning from kamna meaning desire and dhenu meaning fulfilment it was during vedic period that the love for cow started somvanshi httpswwwvethelplineindiacoinveterinarymedicineandanimalkeepinginancientindia when the aryans came they advocated the protection of cows animal diseases and their cure using herbal medicines were well described in the ancient text atharvaveda the text of haya ayurveda and gaja ayurveda written by shalihotra and palakapya respectively describes the equine and elephant husbandry including care and treatment of some ailments according to the ancient history shalihotra is considered as the first known veterinarian of the world thereafter animal husbandry in the country has passed a long way achieving various milestones and making the country one of the global leaders in this sector table 1 this chapter describes the major

husbandry in ancient india 21 prevedic era and the harappan ethos valuable information pertaining to ancient animal keeping were revealed from the archaeological evidences dating back to harappa montgomeri and mohenjodaro larkana districts from punjab and sindh province respectively people from these periods raised and used animals for games and recreation numerous livestock products were consumed namely milk curd ghee etc the animal skin and hides were also documented for having important uses importance of cattle pig fish and other animals including tortoise as food is vastly mentioned during harappan period although fish was the main animal food for people during this period excavations of various paintings seals and stamps and scripts recovered from the indus valley civilization provided tremendous knowledge about their culture and animal husbandry ethos but many of the scripts on the seals have not been decrypted fully bull seal of harappaindian agriculture after independence 4422 vedic and postvedic era in the vedic period animals gained more importance it was during vedic period in india cows were cherished as religious entity and were referred as aghanya ie not to be killed vedic people regarded cow as the source of their good fortune happiness and good health rigveda 6281 6 we have plentiful information on the status of animal keeping care and management in the rigveda according to it people used to feed their cows on nearby pastures to their homes if sufficient pastures were not available there was a practice to generate pastures for cows by clearing the forest lands it is written that the cows were milked thrice a day indicating their utility for milk and availability of quality germplasm pasturesgrazing lands cattle were considered as symbol of wealth aryans fought wars with local tribes for acquiring their cows a valuable asset and named these wars as gavishti evidence exists that aryans also kept dogs for guarding houses and for hunting of boars and preferred cow over buffalo for giving milk a nandi or the breeding bull was selected based on several characters of body and the mothers history of milking management practices like castration of male animals were also practiced during the vedic era and oxen were used for farm transport ploughing and irrigation of agricultural fields small ruminants and their importance had been clearly documented during this period where goat was mostly kept for milk and sheep for wool in the sacred text of rigveda material used to feed domestic animals are mentioned which includes barley sugarcane and deoiled sesame cake the science of animal ayurveda was also documented during the vedic period the information about curing the cow through medicinal herbs and dietary supplements is believed to be written in some of the vedic hymns atharvaveda mentions the treatment of various cow ailments through the use of animal ayurveda vedic people also used surgical methods such as grafting removal of foreign bodies treatment of dislocations fractures and fistula for managing the animal diseases na vs 2015 the aryan people in later period of vedic age also known as iron age witnessed the composition of two great epics of hindus ramayana and mahabharata which also mention the management of animal diseases using medicine oils herbs and also cure through surgical corrections performed by trained vaidhyas it was during this period the use of cow dung as manure in the agricultural fields was noticed its the gopala or krishna 9001000 bc era where we found the information about gau palan and gau sanrakshan govinda was another name given to krishna meaning the protector of cows it was during this period when milk and its products especially milkbutter assumed importance and tax was paid to the king in terms of butter gopashtami was started by krishna where worship of cows was done on a specific day after deepawali panchagavya which includes five things namely cow milk curd and ghee prepared from cow milk cow dung and cow urine gained importance during this period and was practiced in religious rituals the religious texts namely shrimad bhagwat poetry and paintings of the era depicted the role and importance of cow husbandry in the societyanimal husbandry in preindependent india 4523 mauryan era care and management of domestic animals is documented for the mauryan period 322232 bc an important text written by kautilya during the mauryan period was arthashastra which discuss in detail the role and duties of a king in providing care and protection to cows arthashastra also recognizes the role of various domestic livestock and it was during this period that buffalo was also recognized for dairying and difference in milkfat with cow was documented indicating that buffalo milk has a higher fat content texts of arthashastra suggested the creation of separate department in the state for accounting the livestock and land maintained for pastures by villagebased accountants called gopas mauryan period is also known for the introduction of state funded veterinary services na vs 2015 the text describes optimum herd size male to female ratio of cattle feeds and fodder it also mentioned the earnings and trade through different livestock products skin and hide fur and wool the text mentioned the law veterinary jurisprudence and provision of punishments and penalties imposed on committing crime robbery or on ill treatment to cows and noncompliance to pay taxes related to animal husbandry during the mauryan period the horses received special attention as grading of horses based on their utility in battle or transportation has been documented thoroughbred horses were widely kept during this period besides feeding grasses a good detail of their feeding schedules has been described which included the parched rice drippings minced meat and red ricepowder elephants were the prized possession of the kings and were used in warfare to storm the forts of enemy kings and smash open the massive doors of the forts kings and army used elephants to move even in dense forests and marshy lands provision for capital punishment was kept on killing the elephants for their tusks during this period the great king ashoka 300 bc gave veterinary science a major thrust in india it is described that the first known veterinary hospital of the world existed in ashokas regime schwabe 1978 during the gupta period the knowledge documented in arthashastra prospered until islamic rulers invaded india in 800 ad 3 animal husbandry during the medieval era 31 medieval indian dynasties the medieval india is the period between the end of the gupta empire in the 6th century and the start of the mughal empire in 1526 during this period indian subcontinent was majorly ruled by 32 dynasties at different periods in different geographical regions many dynasties were contemporary with each other among 32 dynasties the documentary evidence on animal husbandry is possibly available for 18 dynasties in these dynasties animals were majorly used for the purpose of military transport draft food ceremonial activities maintenance of temples and recreational fighting as the elephants and horses were used in military and for the transport of royal class veterinary science was well developed especially in reddy dynasty reddy 1991 cow ghee was used for perpetual lamps in temples specifically during the eastern chalukya period cows sheep and goats were donated to temples for performing daily sacred activities the numbers of indian agriculture after independence 46animals were donated according to the number of perpetual lamps in a temple and they were maintained by a community called golla or boya apart from the milk and ghee people used to consume meat the meat of goats sheep pigs poultry hare and boar was commonly sold in chalukya dynasty sastri 1955 use of goats sheep pigs and fowl continued for meat purpose in western chalukya dynasty sastri 1955 similarly hides were the part of exports during rashtrakuta dynasty in which bullocks and horses were used for business travels httpsenwikipediaorgwiki economyofrashtrakutaempireof manyakheta although people used to eat meat cows and horses were worshiped for example the cows were given almost equal rights as of humans in chola empire in the same empire the provision of feed to the cows was similar to the provision of food to humans during famines httpsenwikipediaorgwikiellalan similar to the cow horse was also considered as a sacred animal during vijayanagara empire in harsha empire animal slaughter was banned httpsenwikipediaorgwikiharsha to meet feeding needs of cattle pasture lands and grazing fields were maintained in villages in pala empire particularly viasya community used to take care of cattle along with other trade articles targa 1999 interestingly cattle breeding was a separate profession and cattle breeders used to pay separate tax during pallava dynasty httpsfactsberrycomallaboutthepallavadynasty overall animals played a major role in the economy of medieval dynasties which was evident especially in kakatiya dynasty in which the economy was a mix of animal keeping sheep goat crop husbandry jowar and paddy and trade including the export of wool and cotton textiles however in delhi sultanate not much development was seen in the farm animal sector but still taxes were imposed on the basis of number of cattle 32 mughal era the mughal reigned india from 1526 to 1857 during which the country was home to large cattle population historian irfan habib in his book the agrarian system of mughal india pointed out that there were more cattle in india than in europe but with lower milk yields productivity of the cattle and buffalo varied from 15 seers and 230 seers respectively 1 seer 1 kg cattle of gujarat and buffalo of punjab were considered to be the best feeding management of the dairy animals was solely dependent on the milk productivity cattle with good milk production was considered as khas classbreed and fed with near about 6 kg of grain and 15 kg of green grasses per day whereas remaining classes were fed with the half of this ration but peasants of the mughal era used to take extra care of their buffaloes as they were the main milch breed around 8 kg of wheat flour 500 grams of molasses 150 kg of grain and 20 kg of green grasses were fed to the buffalo small ruminants like sheep and goat were the integral part of the animal husbandry out of which goat breed of bengal and coach bihar are specifically mentioned in the literature the mughal emperor akbar improved the irrigation facility throughout his dynasty and cattle ox was used for powering the sakia or persian wheel to bring irrigation water beside traction livestock were used for improving the soil fertility peasants of the southern india animal husbandry in preindependent india 47used to keep goat and sheep flocks for few nights in the crop field for droppings which was considered to be a good source of quality manure it was assumed that a flock of 1000 sheep goats with fivetosixnight stay on a piece of land of 132 acres may maintain the fertility of the field for 6 to 7 years milk was one of the important food items in the diet during the mughal period narayanan 2015 argued that milk and various milk products including yoghurt ghee and butter were also a fairly conspicuous part of the diet in many parts of the northern india therefore many indigenous milk products like rabri phirni khir etc were very popular during mughal period kulfi a delicious frozen dairy dessert often described as traditional indian ice cream originated in the mughal empire in the 16 th century krondl 2011 quoted from ainiakbari where abul fazl mentioned use of saltpeter for refrigeration as well as transportation of himalayan ice to warmer areas to prepare delicious kulfi the horses were regarded as a status symbol in the mughal society chowdhury 2017 the mughal paid great attention to the horses due to its military economic and political importance throughout the dominant mughal period 15261707 the mughals maintained a larger cavalry force and it was their main military strength irvine 1903 therefore the science of horse achieved ultimate heights during the mughal period chowdhury 2017 argued that though the indian climate was not suitable for the horsebreeding then also numerous personal or institutional breeding centers and studs were established all over the mughal dynasty with state patronage state even promoted cross breeding of indigenous horse with the imported horse like arabian persian and turki horses baytars veterinarian was considered as one of the gentleman professions the state also provided protection and patronage to the writers of the equine veterinary literature ie farasnamas which tells about the skills of animalmedicalwisdom for caring healing and managing horses in the stable during mughal era 4 animal husbandry during the british era the company rule in india effectually started from 1757 and ended with the 1857 rebellion after which the british government directly ruled the country until the independence in 1947 development of animal husbandry in india during the colonial era was as per the military and economic needs of the british empire they were initially interested in breeding and health care of only horses which were important for maintaining the cavalry later on cattle rearing gained attention due to increase in demand of military establishments for animal food milk and beef leading to the establishment of military dairy farms much of the scientific developments in the field of dairying in india started from these farms the britishers were least concerned about the requirements of common indian people however they had to take steps for overall development whenever their interest was connected with the common people one such example is setting up of research institutions for controlling the spread of animal epidemics in the country so that it does not affect the herds of military dairy farms these institutions developed a number of vaccines and treatments for various animal diseases formal veterinary education in india also started during the colonial period indian agriculture after independence 48which helped in developing skilled man power another important development during the colonial era was commercialization of milk new dairy processing plants marketing organizations and dairy cooperatives were established for linking the rural producers with urban consumers besides horses and cattle the britishers were also interested in camels mules zebra and poultry for fulfilling their various requirements 41 horse breeding the preliminary work related to the improvement of horses in india started as early as 1793 william frazer an army officer presented a plan for improving the horse breeds of the ganges valley by setting up a stud and assembling the best mares from different parts of the country in his view the horses from cutch in gujarat were at par with the arabic horses and he offered to breed them with best arab stallions randhawa 1983 his proposal was approved and a board was formed in late 1794 for supervising operations related to horse breeding in india the first stud was established in pusa 1794 and subsequently different forage crops like alfalfa bermuda grass clover and guinea grass were introduced in the region thereafter more studs were established in ganjam hisar and hapur the work of frazer was carried forward by moorcroft who introduced better feeding and health management practices in the studs in 1815 horse breeding started in a farm in hisar haryana which was established in 1809 for breeding of camels the responsibility of imperial horse breeding was entrusted to the army remount department in 1904 while the local bodies were in charge for provincial horse breeding 42 establishment of military dairy farms the britishers established military dairy farms in order to ensure sufficient availability of quality milk and milk products for military and british families in india the first military dairy farm was established at allahabad in 1889 later more farms were established across the country and there were around hundred such farms at the time of independence in 1947 improved milch animals with higher productivity were reared and proper records were maintained in these farms wieser 2000 the use of artificial insemination for the cattle in these farms started in 1925 which assisted in herd improvement to some extent besides milk production some of these farms helped in preservation of local breeds military dairy farms can be considered as the first step towards organized dairy farming in india 43 cattle improvement and management the common people in india during the colonial period used to prefer buffalo over cow for dairying due to their higher milk yield as well as more fat content in the milk the yield of buffaloes was somewhere around 227 litre per day cows were specifically preferred in those areas where pastures were present the average milk yield of cow in the country ranged from 04 to 18 litre per day depending on the breed place of rearing and management practices moreover the length of their lactation period was only six months randhawa 1983 some cattle breeds like gujarat sind ongole and nellore were considered better animal husbandry in preindependent india 49than others while there was a vast scope for improvement of other local cattle good dairy animals were fed with oilcake and cotton seed for maintaining their productivity during late eighteenth century william frazer suggested breeding of indigenous cattle with the bulls of nagore breed afterwards cattle breeding started in the government cattle farm of hisar in 1815 the major focus of the farm was on hariana a dualpurpose cattle breed in order to improve the milk yield mysore cattle was also crossed with sind gujarat ongole and nagore breeds in the hisar farm moreover the gujarat cows were studied in detail in pune the royal commission on agriculture 1928 reported poor health and low milk yield of indian cattle as a major constraint in dairy development following which exotic breeds were introduced in the country for breed improvement for increasing the milk yield ayrshire and friesian bulls were recommended for crossing with the native cows gradually provincial agricultural departments took the responsibility of cattle breeding and some of the provincial governments further encouraged the projects related to livestock improvement there was a huge outbreak of cattle plague rinderpest in 186567 and millions of bovines died in different parts of the country leading to a series of famines mishra 2011 in order to avoid spread of disease to the military farms the government was forced to take concrete steps for its control as a result cattle plague commission was formed in the year 1868 for proper disease management unfortunately government was interested in disease management only when their own herd was under threat however between 1901 and 1904 lots of work was carried out for the treatment of anthrax and hemorrhagic septicemia and a vaccine was developed each against blackquarter and rinderpest 44 effect on pastoralism animal husbandry was an important source of livelihood not only for the farmers practicing settled agriculture but also for the pastoral communities the colonial rule affected the lives of pastoralists to a great extent most of the grazing lands were diverted for cultivation which led to the decline of pastures stringent forest rules further restricted the access of livestock to the grasses available in the forest grazing tax was introduced in the midnineteenth century and pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed on the pastures ncert 2006 45 commercialization of milk and market linkage commercialization of milk started in the early twentieth century british troops and growing cities like bombay were the main demand centres of milk in the absence of fast transportation and chilling facilities majority of the milk 688 was converted into less perishable milk products like ghee butter khoa and curd liquid milk which used to fetch higher prices accounted only for 312 of the total sales while the share of ghee 527 was highest the collection centres and distribution network for linking the rural producers in bombay with the urban consumers were set up in 1940 the wellorganized milk indian agriculture after independence 50marketing organizations took the responsibility of milk distribution in other metropolitan cities like delhi madras calcutta karachi kanpur and nagpur polson dairy which was established in 1915 in bombay was one of the first large scale milk processing plant in india keventers and express dairy were the other two popular dairy processors profit was the main motive of these plants and they were not concerned with the development of rural producers farmers were exploited due to dominance of middlemen and contractors in this system banerjee 1994 which led to larger discontentment among the milk producers as a result the cooperative movement started in dairying with the establishment of the kaira district cooperative milk producers union in gujarat in 1946 which was quite successful and encouraged formation of dairy cooperatives across the country after independence kaira district cooperative milk producers union in gujarat 46 development of other livestock horses and cattle received the major attention of the british government but some advancement also took place in the case of other animals like camel mules donkey sheep zebra and poultry birds camels were used by the britishers for transportation and a government farm was established in hisar for camel breeding in 1809 later on this farm was also used for breeding of bullocks mules zebra and sheep local ewes were crossed with merino rams in the farm and an improved breed of sheep namely hissardale was developed which yielded superior quality of fleece status and scope of poultry was discussed in the report of the royal commission on agriculture 1928 and subsequently the institute of poultry research was established at izatnagar in 1938 sinha 2010 animal husbandry in preindependent india 5147 slaughter houses and the gaushalas the britishers started killing cows for beef soon after settling down in india they established slaughter houses on the western pattern in different parts of the country the cow slaughter and consumption of beef increased manifold in northern india during the colonial period but soon after the first war of independence in 1857 many native people were mobilized and they collectively started a movement for protection of cows after rescuing the cows from the butchers they were reared in gaushalas large numbers of gaushalas were established in the country for this purpose between 1880 and 1893 this movement also received the support of mahatma gandhi in the year 1891 prohibition of cow slaughter was one of the many objectives of swaraj movement the british government imposed some restrictions on slaughter of cattle in 1944 and the army was not allowed to slaughter working cattle pregnant and milking animals and the cattle fit for bearing offspring 48 establishment of veterinary colleges and research institutions the first veterinary college was established at lahore in 1882 two years later approval was granted for starting a threeyear veterinary course in parel mumbai afterwards three more veterinary colleges were started in madras calcutta and bihar cattle plague commission which was appointed in 1868 after the severe outbreak of cattle plague epidemic led to the creation of civil veterinary departments in the provinces in 1889 the indian civil veterinary department was established in 1902 and the responsibility of animal husbandry and dairying was entrusted to the provinces in 1919 the cattle plague commission submitted its report in 1871 hallen et al 1871 scientific work on animal diseases in india started in 1889 when an imperial bacteriological laboratory was established in pune where dr alfred lingard worked on diseases of camel and horses sinha 2010 this laboratory was later shifted to mukteswar uttarakhand in 1893 as its cool climate was favorable for bacteriological research and vaccine preservation in 1913 another branch of the laboratory was opened in izatnagar bareilly for mass production of vaccines and serum it was renamed as imperial institute of veterinary research in 1925 and later on as imperial veterinary serum institute imperial veterinary research institute and indian veterinary research institute respectively in 1930 1936 and 1947 meanwhile an institute for dairy specific research was started in bangalore in 1923 by the name imperial institute of animal husbandry dairying it was renamed as imperial dairy research institute in 1936 its headquarters was shifted to karnal mother campus of icarindian veterinary research institute at mukteswar uttarakhandindian agriculture after independence 52haryana after the independence in 1955 and again renamed as national dairy research institute 5 conclusion in the preindependent india animal husbandry was largely a subsistence activity there was some knowledge about good animal breeds feeding schedule and disease management during colonial era scientific developments like breeding artificial insemination food processing recordkeeping etc started but these were mostly restricted to the government farms and institutes the common people were able to gain direct benefits from these advancements to a limited extent widespread poverty and low productivity of animals were the immediate challenges at the time of independence india which is now the top milk producing country was suffering due to milk shortage in 1947 presents the complete picture of that period despite all this developments like beginning of formal veterinary education establishment of research institutes and initiation of dairy cooperative

2icarindian agricultural research institute new delhi summary climate water and soil have been the major determinants of agricultural productivity these three vital natural resources are eternally related with one another and also with crop animal and human health climate determines the availability of water and formation as well as health of soil climatic processes on the other side are also influenced by water bodies and soil since the beginning of the civilization when the hunting and food gathering humans started to settle down initiating domestication of animals and growing crops these natural resources shaped the human activities and dictated the path of the progress of the civilization the importance of these resources was well known to the indians since the vedic and epic ages kautilyas arthasastra discussed meteorological aspects of agriculture different rain bearing clouds and measurement of rainfall using a fixed dimension vessel as a rain gauge poet kalidasa mentioned the dates of onset of monsoon and its path over central india in his famous epic meghdoot manu of the fame of manusmriti recognized the sun as the source of energy for all weather systems varhamihiras brihat samhita discussed planetary movements eclipses rainfall and clouds scientific study of climate however started in the 17 th century after the inventions of instruments for accurate measurements of climatic controls in 1793 first meteorological unit one of the oldest stations of the world started in madras by j goldingham with several other developments in climatology the climatological charts of india and neighbourhood was published by india meteorology department imd for meteorologists and airmen in 1946 as agriculture grew the use of water available in rivers lakes and underground reservoirs through the water withdrawal structures were developed the kings emperors and rulers constructed withdrawal and conveyance structures to carry water to the fields and domestic use construction of lake sudarsana in 300 bc followed by grand anicut bahur tank gangaikonda cholapuram tank bhojpur lake anantaraja sagara tank early western yamuna canal early bari doab or hasli canal and early eastern yamuna canal are some of the prominent examples of irrigation systems in the county before independence modern irrigation systems are backed by the strong ancient knowledge of water resource management the vedas and upanishads mentioned soil as synonymous with the mother farmers of the indus valley civilization used to plough the soil apply cow dung as manure broadcast seeds and use a certain sequence of cropping and fallowing the mauryan empire categorized the soils natural resource management in preindependent india 55understanding the nature properties and classification of soil improved considerably in late 1800s with initiative of jw leather commonly acknowledged as the father of soil science and agricultural chemistry in india indian scientists assessed the contributions of biological nitrogen fixation and methods of ameliorating the problem soils in a land mark development first soil map of india based on soil characteristics was prepared in 1943 researchers of preindependent india did many significant works for improving the scientific understanding of climate water and soil which still stand as classical foundation of modern science for natural resources management the concepts such as one health circular economy organic farming integrated farming system crop planning and several others which emerged in the ancient period are now being refined and reemphasized for climateresilient sustainable agriculture 1 introduction the biotic process of agriculture is majorly controlled by abiotic factors of climate water and soil most often agricultural productivity is seriously limited by various abiotic stresses such as salinity drought flooding heat cold and freezing the reduction in performance of crops livestock poultry and fishes have been found to be due to the negative impacts of these stresses on growth and development industrialization urbanization and climate change further exacerbate the detrimental effects of these stresses on agriculture management of natural resources is thus crucial for the progress of indian agriculture efficient utilization of water and soil has been practiced from the ancient times in one or other forms ancient literature vedas upanishadas ramayana mahabharata have descriptions of climate water soil and their interrelationships the scriptures described the five elements of the universe pancha mahabhutas pancha tatwas as the keys to crop animal and human welfare the concepts of one health circular economy organic farming integrated farming system crop planning and several others emerged in the ancient period for improving the productivity and sustainability of crop and animal husbandry starting from the indus valley civilization the rulers of all the subsequent periods gave importance to the development of irrigation infrastructure and soil management systems as the science progressed so did the management of natural resources efficient management of these resources played a major role in enhancing agricultural production and achieving food security in india particularly during the period of the green revolution several natural resource management technologies have been developed for enhancing and stabilizing agricultural productivity this chapter discusses the major developments in climatology water and soil in preindependent india on which the foundation of modern research and development of natural resources management has been built 2 climatology in preindependence era climate has been the major determinant of agricultural production in india a favourable southwest monsoon is critical in securing good yields of rainfed crops as well as water for irrigating crops failure of monsoon causing drought has led to major famines in the past in several parts of india accordingly indian scientists tried to analyse and understand indian agriculture after independence 56the climate processes and predict their behaviour so that the crop calendar can be set and risk management strategies developed the trace of meteorology and climate science in india can be found since the ancient times table 1 the earliest reference is in the rig veda 50002000 bc which mentions the classification of seasons bursts of monsoon rainproducing weather systems cloud formation and their classification it also linked the hindu deities with weather events such as indra to rain and marut to wind ghosh 1983 the occurrence and intensity of weather events were also linked to the deities pleasure or displeasure the upanishadas 3000 bc mentions about the processes of cloud and rain formation booth 2015 and describes the seasonal cycles as an effect due to earths movement around the sun kautilyas arthasastra 321296 bc discussed meteorological aspects of agriculture different forms of rainbearing clouds and measurement of rainfall using rain gauge which was a circular vessel 20 fingers width 8 fingers depth and the unit to measure rain was adhaka which is equal to 12 mm imd 1976 james and james 2013 it also mentions forecasting of weather using the planetary motions of jupiter and venus iyenger 2009 kalidasa the poet and dramatist in the 1 st century ad mentioned the dates of onset of monsoon and its path over central india in his famous epic meghdoot datta 1983 around 200 ad manu also known as svayambhuva in his famous compilation manusmriti recognized the sun as the energy source for all weather systems the motto of the india meteorological department imd adittyat jayate vrishthi meaning from the sun rain is born has been taken from this publication panini in the 5 th century described the rainy season and process of rainfall measurement varhamihira 505587 ad wrote brihat samhita and discussed about planetary movements eclipses pregnancy of clouds pregnancy of air quantity of rainfall and signs of immediate rain the brihat samhita also mentions of rain measuring vessels of fixed diameter and depth yuan chwang a traveller from china to india during the 7 th century ad mentioned the climate of different parts of india such as mathura hot and andhra moist and hot imd 1976 in his treatise there are many citations of flood and drought events in different parts of india halley 1636 a british astronomer in his treatise on indian summer monsoon described it as a seasonal reversal of wind due to differential heating of landmasses this treatise is considered to be one of the landmarks in the field of climatology rajeevan et al 2021 table 1 chronology of some important meteorological events in

by imd 1946 climatological charts of india and neighbourhood was published by imd for meteorologists and airmenindian agriculture after independence 58the beginning of modern meteorology in the world is marked with the invention of the barometer and thermometer in the 17th century these inventions started the scientific measurements of the atmospheric variables on scientific principles the earliest meteorological observation in india was taken at madras in september 1793 by j goldingham who was the second astronomer appointed at madras observatory by the british east india company the madras observatory was established in 1792 and is considered as one of the oldest observatories of the world the second observatory in india was established at colaba bombay in 1823 henry piddington an english sea captain settled in bengal significantly encouraged the growth of meteorology and climatology in india by publishing around 40 papers related to tropical storms during 1835 in the journal of asiatic society he coined the term cyclone meaning coil of snake and in 1842 his monumental work laws of storms was published piddington 1842 in 1843 incharge of colaba observatory dr buist started the earliest attempts of recording upper air observations using a balloon at byculla station in india in october 1852 radhanath sikdar added another milestone in the indian climatological history by becoming the first indian superintendent of the government observatory at calcutta he introduced systematic and accurate observation recording systems at the calcutta observatory in december 1852 which were published regularly in the journal of asiatic society of bengal during 185376 the publication consisted of hourly daily and monthly means ranges and extremes of principal and derived weather parameters this was one of the landmark events in data recording for longterm studies in 1874 hf blanford was appointed as first imperial meteorological reporter to the government of india raj 2013 in 1875 government of india set up the meteorological department at calcutta under hf blanford to bring all the meteorological work in the country under one organization this was initially known as the alipore office the first headquarter of imd blanford 1886 published a book rainfall of india a remarkable contribution on indias weather and climate he also initiated the systems of longrange forecasting of rainfall in india though the first solar observation was made at dehradun in 1878 the systematic recording of solar radiation started in 1893 when the government of india sanctioned the first solar physics observatory at kodaikanal in palani hills in tamil nadu india became the full member of the international meteorological orga nisation in 1878 and in the same year india daily weather report idwr started publishing from shimla imd 1976 madras observatory source imdnatural resource management in preindependent india 59the country realized the need for seasonal forecast of rainfall which was issued first by imd on 4th june 1886 this made india the first country to start systematic development in long range forecasting lrf in 1889 john eliot was appointed as first director general of observatories of imd at calcutta he was well known for improving the lrf of monsoon rains along with gilbert walker imd 1976 upper air measurements started in india in 1905 using tracking balloons with theodolite followed by routine observations from pilot balloon in 1913 katz 2002 in 1909 walker developed multiple regression models for forecasting monsoon rainfall over india in 1924 he discovered the walker circulation and southern oscillation and established the link between the indian monsoon with global meteorological phenomenon adamson 2020 in 1928 with an objective to undertake monsoon research with improved facilities imd headquarters was established in pune and in the same year the sounding balloon ascents commenced in india from pune which is considered as start of an important research area to study the vertical profile of the atmosphere kr ramanathan published the diagram of the distribution of upper atmospheric distribution over the globe in 1928 and in 1930 he published discussion of results of sounding balloon ascents in 1931 pr krishna rao published distribution of temperature in lower stratosphere in 1932 la ramdas studied the horizontal and vertical climatic variations near the ground surface ramdas and malurkar 1932 the agricultural meteorology branch of imd also started functioning under his leadership in 1932 which was one of the earliest of its kind in the world by 1933 india made significant improvements in manufacturing measurement devices for weather parameters and started the manufacture of symons rain gauge cup anemometer and wind vanes in 1936 imd published meteorology for airmen in india for aviation sector the advancements of upper air measurements continued to grow and in 1943 ls mathur developed clock type ctype radiosonde and in the same year sp venkateshwaran developed fan type ftype radiosonde in india this was followed by the historic event of the first radiosonde observations in india in 1943 and radio wind in 1949 in 1944 sk banerjee became first indian director general of imd in 1946 climatological charts of india and neighbourhood for meteorologists and airmen was published by imd imd 1978 all these developments formed a sound basis for subsequent progress in climate research of the country after independence 3 water resource management in preindependent india since ancient times agriculture evolved and the civilizations prospered along the rivers which were water sources for domestic use and irrigation water from the rivers used to be diverted to the fields through inundation channels shallow open wells were also used in some areas the region where substrata consisted of rocks and it was not easy to dig well rainwater used to be collected in tanks reservoirs and upstream of embankment constructed across the drainage lines water from these reservoirs was released to the field in regulated quantities systematic irrigation became a necessity when civilizations started to flourish earliest available records indicate that indians practiced irrigation for raising crops as early as the fourth millennium bc references on sources of water evaporation indian agriculture after independence 60condensation cloud formation and the hydrological cycle construction of anicuts across perennial rivers excavation of canals from such rivers tanks and wells are available in the vedas mention of pranali kuly sarase nika and nalika in sanskrit literature suggests that the canals were used for irrigation in ancient time the vedic texts suggest that eastern afghanistan north west frontier province kashmir and parts of sindh and rajasthan were the regions covered by the seven rivers the saptasindhu and the channels from these rivers were used for irrigation according to ancient lore rishi narda once enquired king yudhishtra are the farmers sturdy and prosperous are their dams full of water and big enough and distributed in different parts of the kingdom and that agriculture does not depend on rains only there is also mention of irrigation from river and kheya dyke and bendhya bund constructed to prevent water from flowing out of field in narada smruti rangachari et al 2012 31 ancient irrigation system history of irrigation goes back to the time of indus valley civilization around 4500 bc welldesigned irrigation and drainage systems led to the prosperity during indus valley civilization and planned settlements with drainage and sewers in ancient times flood or sailab irrigation was the common practice in the flood plains of rivers in northern india and the deltaic region of central and south india tanks were used for rainwater harvesting and irrigation in southern peninsula well irrigation was common in the alluvial plains of northern india and in other parts of the country artificial reservoirs at girnar dated to 3000 bc and an early canal irrigation system around 2600 bc rodda and ubertini 2004 in the indus valley civilization waterlifting devices were used to lift water from wells archaeological evidences suggest that irrigation and drinking water supply system from large linedwell existed during that period reservoirs to collect rainwater were found in dholavira which is an important indus valley site sir robert eric mortimer wheeler a british archaeologist and officer in the british army in his book early india and pakistan wrote that food crops and cotton were grown with irrigation during the indus valley civilization mohenjodaro had protective banks and bunds to save the land from disastrous inundation mention of dams and barrages are found in manusmriti and arthasastra mention of the words such as varsha pramana rain measurement jalasutrada water engineers or hydraulic engineers in ancient literature indicate that water management and irrigation were practiced in ancient india rangachari et al 2012 in situ rainwater harvesting in different types of structures and utilization or rainwater harvesting in large reservoir and transporting it to water scarce areas had been practiced in india since ancient time as the rainfall varies in time and space different regions in india had different types of rainwater harvesting structures depending on the rainfall soil type slope and climate rainwater harvesting and storage structures such as khadin baoli gul kund alabs johad aharpynes bamboo pipes kul katta zabo eri virdas and surangam which were evolved in ancient time are used even now city of delhi when founded in early eleventh century was getting water from suraj kund which was constructed to harvest the rain over the aravalli hills the pynes and ahars systems used in south bihar natural resource management in preindependent india 61and jharkhand were evolved during the mauryan rule ahars are water storage areas having embankment on three sides with fourth side left open for surface runoff to fill the area naturally pynes are diversion channels that transport the flood water to fields and ahars contouring bunding bench terracing and gabarbands used in harappa are used for in situ moisture conservation in several parts of india with the increase in population the traditional rainwater harvesting structures were not able to supply the water needed for domestic and agriculture sector the shortage of water during the drought years affected agriculture production and water availability for domestic use severely severity of drought during 176970 178384 179192 183738 186061 186567 186870 187374 187678 1896 97 and 18991900 was so much that it resulted in worst famines the country faced several million people died during these famines british government set up famine commissions to find out the reasons and suggest measures along with several measures to prevent the famine lyall commission set up in 1897 recommended the development of irrigation facilities after the famine of 18991900 lord curzon set up mac donnell commission in 1900 to reevaluate the report of the previous commissions it recommended several measures including improvement of irrigation facilities again in 1901 lord curzon formed a special commission to report on the irrigation as a protection against famine this was the first indian irrigation commission which recommended for increasing irrigated area initiating a very extensive programme of protective irrigation works in the tract that were likely to suffer from famine designing of irrigation and drainage structures was known to indians from the time of harappan civilization they knew how to plan design and construct water reservoirs drinking water supply system irrigation channels wellgraded drains water distribution systems and sewerage system welldeveloped irrigation infrastructure and water distribution rules during the mauryan era 321 to 185 bc are good examples of public irrigation works taxes were collected from cultivators availing irrigation facility from the state there is mention of the construction of dam across the river and provision of sluice gates for withdrawals of water in arthasastra megasthenes the famous greek ambassador to the court of emperor chandragupta around 300 bc recorded in his book that the district officers used to measure the land and inspected the sluices so that everyone could get a fair share of the benefit king avantivarman carried out extensive engineering work in the vitasta jhelum valley in kashmir for its drainage and irrigation system efficient regulation of the river course by engineer suyya of kashmir

development during the british rule during the british rule the existing irrigation infrastructures were renovated and improved besides the construction of new irrigation systems large irrigation projects such as cauvery godavari and krishna delta systems were constructed during the early and middle of the 19th century the western and eastern yamuna canals the ganga and bari doab canals were also constructed that was the time when private companies were encouraged by the government for construction of irrigation systems the east india irrigation and canal company were established in 1858 originally for the coastal plains of odisha and adjoining areas the irrigation projects such as mahanadi brahmani baitarani subarnarekha and kosi derived their names from the rivers from which they originated the madras irrigation company was formed in 1863 tungabhadra project in south india was completed partly by the company and partly by the government the sone canal in bihar was constructed during this period government of india initiated some large irrigation projects during the period 18361866 which are referred as classical works these were the upper ganga canal in uttar pradesh the upper bari doab canal in the punjab and godavari and krishna delta projects in andhra pradesh the upper ganga canal known as ganga canal at that time was the classical project completed during

middle ages there are repeated references of soil and its management practices in the vedic texts table 4 the hymns to goddess earth in the atharva veda provide excellent reference to earth and soil and their connects to the individual and society it highlights that soil is not a commodity but a part of our living community the earth that supports all furnishes wealth the foundation the goldenbreasted restingplace of all living creatures in the vedic period farmers used to plough the soil broadcast the seeds and used a certain sequence of cropping and fallowing cow dung was used for fertilizer anonymous 2012 the indus valley civilization provides evidence of an animaldrawn plough dating back to 2500 bce lal 2001 the mauryan empire 322185 bce categorized soils and made meteorological observations for agricultural use they also constructed dams and had horsedrawn chariots which are quicker than common bullock carts anonymous 2008 megasthenes the greek diplomat c 300 bc in his book indika observed india has many huge mountains which abound in fruittrees of every kind and many vast plains of great fertility the greater part of the soil moreover is under irrigation and consequently bears two crops in the course of the year since there are two monsoons in each year the inhabitants of india almost always gather in two harvests annually importance of organic manure has been mentioned in the rig and atharva vedas the holy quran also implies recycling of postharvest residues mentioning that at least onenatural resource management in preindependent india 65third of what is taken out from soil should be returned to it the deccan plateau region developed the ash mound tradition dating back 2800 bc this is characterized by large mounds of burned cattle dung and other materials for growing millets and pulses they also herded cattle sheep and goat and were largely engaged in pastoralism fuller 2006 in the east of india neolithic people grew rice and pulses as well as kept cattle sheep and goat during the early common era systematic ploughing manuring weeding irrigation and crop protection were practiced in south india for sustained agriculture pillay 1972 agricultural zones were broadly divided into those producing rice wheat or millets anonymous 2008 during this era sugar mills were developed and use of a draw bar for sugarmilling appeared at delhi in 1540 geared sugar rolling mills later appeared in mughal india using the principle of rollers as well as worm gearing by the 17 th century habib 2011 42 mughal era 15261757 ce agricultural production increased during the period and indias population growth accelerated a variety of crops including wheat rice barley cotton indigo and opium was grown by the mid17 th century india started growing maize and tobacco the new crops from the americas karl 2015 land management was strong during the regime of akbar the great 15561605 scholarbureaucrat todarmal implemented elaborated methods for management of agriculture on a rational basis kumar 2005 the mughal administration emphasized agrarian reforms which began under sher shah suri akbar also adopted and furthered with more reforms the civil administration was organized in a hierarchical manner on the basis of merit with promotions based on performance they built irrigation systems across the empire to produce more crop yields and increase the net revenue base leading to increased agricultural production karl 2015 a major reform introduced by akbar was a new land revenue system called zabt which was a monetary tax system based on a uniform currency with this system extensive cadastral surveying was conducted to assess the area of land under plough cultivation the mughal state encouraged greater land cultivation by offering taxfree periods to those who brought new land under cultivation richards 2003 indian agriculture was more advanced compared to many other parts of the world such as the common use of the seed drill which were adopted by the peasants of other countries much later habib et al 1987 when the farmers of the other parts of the world used to grow very few crops indian farmers were skilled in growing a wide variety of food and nonfood crops the increased agricultural productivity led to lower food prices which was about onehalf in south india and onethird in bengal in terms of silver in the 18 th century parthasarathi 2011 farmers of bengal learned techniques of mulberry cultivation and sericulture establishing bengal subah as a major silkproducing region of the world richards 1995 during the second half of the 19th century land under cultivation expanded at an average rate of about 1 per year due to extensive irrigation networks punjab narmada valley and andhra pradesh became the centers of agrarian reformsindian agriculture after independence 66table 4 milestones of soil science in preindependent india period milestone 50002000 bcvedas and upanishads mentioned soil as synonymous with

a soil map of india based on soil character istics 43 british era 17571947 431 soil resources and fertility in view of recurring famines and no breakthrough happening on application of the recommendations made by various famine commissions the imperial establishment observed the need for seeking the help of one first class expert to make a general enquiry into the character of soils and agricultural conditions of the country accordingly in 1889 ja v oelcker was appointed to advise upon the best course to be adopted to apply the principles of agricultural chemistry to induct improvements in indian agriculture this is regarded as the first serious endeavour to frame a policy of agricultural research having orientation to soils suiting indian conditions appointment of jw leather was an outcome of his recommendation to infuse a sound system of scientific investigation with agricultural chemistry as the central approach visit of the royal commission on agriculture in 1926 and its report in 1929 are the events that drew attention to the condition of indian soils natural resource management in preindependent india 67which have been depleted to the extent that no further depletion is possible jw leather commonly acknowledged as the father of soil science and agricultural chemistry in india devised an indigenous method of characterizing indian soils based on geological formations and soil colour he classified soils as alluvial black red and lateritic which still stand as a classical work on the basis of information emanating from different surveys madam scholasky prepared the first soil map of india which she displayed in 1932 in england a map depicting the physiographical and geological foundations of the countrys soils was published subsequently in 1935 by dn wadia jn mukherjee and ms krishnan under the aegis of the geological survey of india the first ever soil map of india depicting soil properties however was prepared in 1943 by b viswanath and ac ukil at indian agricultural research institute iari new delhi the allindia soil survey scheme initiated in 1943 examined and collated the available soil survey information and the related analytical data which could be suitably projected on the soil map of india its final report prepared by sp raychaudhury in 1953 embodied the first comprehensive work on soil survey in the country soil map of india prepared by viswanath and ukil 1943 pioneering work of jw leather set the cornerstone of soil fertility research in india he compiled soil fertility research work for the first time in india in 1907 describing recommended methods for soil analysis he also established permanent manurial experiments at cawnpore now kanpur and coimbatore in the year 1883 on the lines of indian agriculture after independence 68lawes rothamsted experiment in united kingdom for evaluating soil productivity on a longterm basis stewart 1947 recommended largescale manurial trials to allow interplay of soil climate and management factors to generate reliable data for practical use role of organic sources for supplying plant nutrients was realized long back organic matter status cn ratio and fluctuations in the amount of soil humus were investigated at several locations ie coimbatore by wh harrison pv ramiah and b viswanath 19221935 nagpur by dv bal and jg shrikhande 19361939 and allahabad by nr dhar and associates 19321939 dv bal a srinivasan and jk basu 19271939 significantly contributed for accurate estimation of nitrogen in the soil this was followed by the determination of various forms of soil nitrogen and estimation of leaching and volatilization losses during the next few years 19321939 by v subramanyan and jg shrikhande at lahore an puri with his coworkers worked on extraction of humus and determination of its physicochemical properties 193641 and rc hoon on organic matter of hill and mountain soils from 1937 to 1940 gc esh and ss guha carried out detailed studies on humic acids as well as characteristics of peat and organic soils vaidyanathan 1933 summarized more than 5000 permanent manurial experiments and suggested manure application during fallow periods to restore soil fertility during 192545 jn mukherjee a physical chemist at the university of calcutta made sterling contributions on electrochemicals and rheological properties of soil clays and clay minerals cation exchange in soil xray and dehydration studies of clays and exchange of aluminum and hydrogen ions in clays with other mukherjees contributions on the concept of diffused double layer neutralization of the charge of colloids and nature of soil acidity mukherjee 1922a b have great significance and presentday relevance nature 1972 the significance of baseexchange and buffering properties of soils of south india had also been brought out by b viswanath during 192933 the other major centre of activity in soil chemistry functioned under the guidance of an puri who was first to work on soil physical chemistry in india as a physical chemist at iari pusa bihar 1924 30 and then moved to lahore as director of the university institute of chemistry he did pioneering work on ion exchange characteristics particularly in saltaffected soils and practical applications of ion exchange properties in soil management sl das at iari pusa bihar developed potassium carbonate extraction procedure for plant available p in calcareous soils das 1930 this proved to be the forerunner of the todays most widely used olsens procedure sodium bicarbonate extraction for soil p determination systematic research on problem soils was initiated in the late 19 th century 189496 by jw leather with constitution of the reh commission to examine various aspects of usar soils the departments of agriculture in uttar pradesh bengal bombay bihar punjab and travancore came out with a score of status reports on the distribution characteristics and reclamation of sodic soils 191027 a publication entitled alkali soils of deccan was brought out by dl sahasrabuddhe in 1937 at allahabad in addition to survey work emphasis was laid on the reclamation of these soils by using materials other than gypsum natural resource management in preindependent india 69during the period 1934 to 1942 by nr dhar sk mukherjee bk mukherji and rr agarwal molasses and pressmud wastes from the sugar industry supplemented with organic wastes showed excellent positive results on reclamation attention towards saline soils was drawn years afterward when wh harrison and gs henderson followed by pv ramiah v a tamhane and b viswanath carried out useful studies on salinity problems in soils during 1910s and 1920s at lahore an puri and rc hoon conducted pioneering studies on soil salinity especially measuring the effect of electrical conductivity ec and its impact on soil fertility coastal saline soils of bengal were featured in the investigations by jn mukherjee in first half of 1940s soils of assam and northeast india were investigated during first half of 1920s by ph carpenter and cj harrison who showed that soils in the region were acidic and required lime for amelioration 432 use of organic manure and fertilizer rao bahadur b vishwanath in 1937 emphasized that organic manure is the life of soil sir albert howard at the institute of plant industry indore believed that a shift from natures methods of crop production to the adoption of newer methods leads to loss of soil fertility howard 1940 acharya vinoba bhave experimented with rishi krishi at his paunar ashram near wardha maharashtra these retrogressive thinking sowed the seeds of the organic movement in india today placing great emphasis on the use of composts and other sources of organic nutrients to the total exclusion of chemical fertilisers and plant protection chemicals the root of organic farming thus initiated in india with the work of albert howard an agricultural scientist and robert mccarrison a doctor composting in india was initiated by howard 1935 also called the indore method of composting howard published details of the indore method in 1931 in a book called the waste products of agriculture their utilization as humus howard 1931 howard concluded that humusrich soils are the key for successful organic farming in his famous book an agricultural testament he emphasized that the whole farm is the starting point and basic unit of agricultural research and that much of the disease is due to inadmissible farming methods without proper care of soil howard 1947 robert mccarrison worked at the nutrition research laboratories in coonoor studied the relationships among soil fertility food quality and human nutrition he examined that food quality decreases with increased use of mineral nitrogen fertilizer mccarrison and viswanath 1926 he defined wheel of health consisting of soil plant animal and humans ie properly composted organic residues create a fertile soil on which healthy plant grow to offer healthy diet for animals and humans during 1934 to 1939 scientists at bangalore subramanyan 1929 acharya 1935 worked on the determination of organic matter in soil and its various components like cellulose hemicelluloses and furfural ghosh 1984 acharya 1949 quantified the cattle manure and town waste produced in india and estimated its composition shrikhande 1943 1945 showed that 60 n becomes available from green manures composts and oilcakes in 60 to 70 days beyond which there is insignificant mineralization chemical fertilizers were introduced in the country in 1940s their largescale use however started with the advent of green revolution in the 1960s with the introduction of highyielding indian agriculture after independence 70dwarf varieties that were resistant to lodging on the application of high doses of fertilizers and development of irrigation facilities 433 soil biology and biochemistry the pioneering work of cm hutchinson laid the foundation of soil microbiology in india bringing out the importance of bacteria in soil fertility the earliest landmark was c barghtheils work during 1903 to 1908 on soil inoculation of indigo indigofera tinctoria in north bihar subsequently soil inoculation was introduced to nodulate egyptian clover trifolium alexandrinum nv joshi was the first to work on nitrogen fixation in groundnut and nitrification from 1911 to 1919 and then on biological decomposition of organic matter and prevention of nitrogen losses from soil during 1919 to 1921 joshi 1932 nitrogen fixation was also investigated by pe lander in punjab from 1925 to 1927 and b viswanath at coimbatore during 1925 studies on actinomycetes were undertaken by rv norris and v subramanyan from 1929 to 1930 bn singh developed a methodology for the study of soil protozoa and other soil flagellates 1941 1946 highlighting their role in biological equilibrium in soil for the first time in india systematic research on isolation and identification of rhizobium from different cultivated legumes started with a study by nv joshi in 1920 non symbiotic nitrogen fixation and the mechanism involved were investigated at bangalore and coimbatore by tr bhaskaran and v subramanyan during 193538 and in punjab by nv joshi sv desai and mr madhok during 1933 to 1939 ghosh 1984 cn acharya in 1940 recognized the importance of organic manures in enriching soil fertility and better utilization of agricultural wastes for production of biogas and compost pk de 1936 reported that the fertility of indian rice fields is maintained due to the proliferation of cynobacteria in the soil later rn singh 1942 at banaras hindu university established agricultural significance of blue green algae bga in the nitrogen economy of soils growing rice establishing the role of biological nitrogen fixation by v subramanyan loss of nitrogen during decomposition by tr bhaskaran and relationship of soil fertility with total microbiological activity by sv desai and wv b sundara rao are regarded as other significant developments in the field of soil microbiology during 1936 to 1941 ghosh 1984 5 conclusion under the everintensifying pressures of population and unscientific development the natural resources have been shrinking and declining fast reaching a critical level global climate change is adversely affecting crops soils water and biodiversity aggravating the deterioration of the resources there may be considerable effects on land use due to snow melt availability of irrigation frequency and intensity of interand intraseasonal droughts and floods soil organic matter transformations soil erosion changes in pest profiles decline in arable areas due to submergence of coastal lands and availability of energy and on trade and overall economy in order to meet the expanding needs of food natural resource management in preindependent india 71agricultural products and clean drinking water these resources should be conserved and further enhanced scienceled management practices should be developed to produce more and more from less and less to ensure sustainable development the ancient and eternal philosophy of living in harmony with nature and simple living and high thinking should be the central concepts of agricultural development indian scientists since ancient medieval and british periods have made formidable contributions towards this cause which formed the backbone of modern research and development in climate water and soil research in the country and elsewhere

summary india has witnessed phenomenal transformation from a food importing to a food surplus nation during seven and half decades of its independence the journey of this transition is delineated by ushering green revolution in mid1960s the yellow revolution in the early 1990s the gene revolution in early 2000s and the pulse revolution in the 2010s india has emerged as worlds largest producer of pulses pearl millet and cotton and second best in wheat rice groundnut rapeseed mustard and sugarcane in the recent past it emerged as the largest exporter of rice in this long journey several milestones through the organized research have been achieved the consistent efforts in varietal improvement since 1951 resulted over 5508 high yielding varieties of all major crops such as rice wheat cotton oilseeds crops pulses and sugarcane these varieties and their matching production and protection technologies have been the hallmarks of the organized research programme in the country apart from the miracle variety ir 8 of rice and sonalika and kalyansona of wheat during green revolution period several varieties in different crops like jaya samba mashuri and swarna of rice lok 1 pbw 343

and co 86032 of sugarcane emerged as mega varieties in respective crops which revolutionized the indian agriculture the disruption in the form of bt cotton proved gamechanger in 2002 the area of cotton recorded sharp rise after 2002 and bt cotton occupying more than 94 of the cotton area in 202021 india became the first country to develop composite maize and successfully developed pearl millet pigeonpea castor and cotton hybrids after attaining food security indias next major initiative was indian agriculture after independence 74to breed food crops with better nutritional value the intensified efforts helped to develop about 85 biofortified varieties of different crops by 2021 drr dhan 45 of rice hpbw 01 of wheat shakti the qpm composite of maize nrc 147 with the high oleic acid and nrc 127 free from kunitz trypsin inhibitor of soybean girnar 3 with high oleic acid of groundnut and pusa vaibhav with high iron of lentil were the first biofortified varieties in respective crops paved the way for developing a greater number of such varieties in different crops to develop crop adaptation to climate change 1300 climateresilient varieties of different crops were developed for cultivation by farmers during 20102021 flood tolerant swarna sub1 of rice salt tolerant kharachia 65 and heat tolerant jg14 of chickpea found prominence in cultivation varietal development programmes were successful in insulating crops against key diseases rusts in wheat blast and blights in rice wilt in chickpea and lentils powdery mildew in field pea and urdbean downy mildew in sorghum and white rust in rapeseed and mustard were successfully contained through resistance breeding india became the first country to overcome ug99 attack of stem rust and now almost all releases are resistant to ug99 crop improvement programmes in the recent decades have been reoriented with greater emphasis on genomic resource development for targeted traits and crops india has contributed significantly to the publication of genome sequences of seven crops including rice wheat pigeonpea chickpea and jute the molecular marker assisted technologies so far led to the development of 48 varieties in cereals oilseeds and pulses for different traits future efforts are endeavoured to accelerate the breeding process through speed breeding protocols and genomic selections adaptation to climate change value addition and diversification genome editing and transgenic development protocols are providing hope for developing and cultivating new varieties of agricultural crops the technological developments and policies will help not only in increasing the productivity of crops but also reaching the crops in nontraditional niches for area expansion 1 introduction india marched from foodaid dependency to selfsufficiency in food production which has been the most remarkable achievement of postindependent india about sixfold increase in food grain production more than fivefold increase in rice production over sixteenfold increase in wheat and maize productions elevenfold increase in cotton and jute sixfold increase in oilseed and sugarcane and more than threefold increase in pulses production have been achieved over the last seven and half decades india ranks number one globally in the production of pulses pearl millet and cotton and second in wheat rice groundnut rapeseed mustard and sugarcane the country has emerged as the largest exporter of rice in the recent past such achievements became possible with the innovations in technologies including highyielding varieties irrigation fertilizer and farm policies the agricultural sector is the primary source of livelihood for about 58 of the population in the country the share of agriculture in the gross domestic product gdp is about 17 about half of which is contributed by the agricultural crops mof 202021 the food grain production in india has reached an alltime high to 31451 million tons mt in 202122 in the pregreen revolution period 195152 to 196667 india was heavily dependent achievements in field crops in independent india 75on food imports the postgreen revolution 196768 to 198586 period however experienced a visible acceleration and food grain production doubled from 742 mt to 150 mt the production has again doubled from 150 mt in 198586 to 31451 mt in 202122 but it took longer time of about 35 years due to deceleration in agricultural productivity 199798 onwards nevertheless continuous supply of agricultural commodities especially staples like rice wheat and pulses enabled to achieve the food security in the country while green revolution revolutionised the food production it also strengthened and expanded the national agricultural research system nars many research institutes all india coordinated research projects aicrps and state agricultural universities were initiated and made operation under the ambit of the indian council of agricultural research icar the research institutes on rice jute and sugarcane established in the preindependent india were brought under the purview of icar in 1966 the organized research on other crops was carried out by the establishment of aicrps in 1967 for achieving sustained agricultural growth of 4 india further expanded nars in 197793 and directorate and national research centres on some selected crops were established to give research impetus subsequently directorates on different crop groups such as pulses and oilseeds were upgraded to the institute level to foster multidisciplinary research currently the cropbased research is being carried out by 28 national institutes including one deemedtobeuniversity 3 bureaus 2 project directorates 1 national research centre 22 aicrps and 10 all india network projects ainp the technological developments and policies helped in increasing the productivity and simultaneously pushed the crops in nontraditional niches for area expansion the area expansion of rice and sugarcane in north groundnut in gujarat chickpea in the southern peninsula mungbean in rajasthan soybean adoption in madhya pradesh and maharashtra are few examples to cite in addition significant contribution has been made by public and private sector in hybrid technology for cotton pearl millet castor and pigeonpea in public as well as private sectors crop improvement programmes in the recent decades have been reoriented with greater emphasis on genomic resource development for targeted traits and crops prebreeding efforts have been intensified for identification of desirable genes in related and wild species such efforts helped to broaden the genetic base by transferring desirable alleles from wild sources significant progress has been made in biotechnological tools such as markerassisted breeding and transgenic development for efficient crop improvement decoding of genomes of rice wheat flax and chickpea was done through international collaboration india has contributed significantly to the publication of genome sequences of seven crops sequence information provided the proteincoding genes for disease resistance and tolerance to drought heat and salinity which will be a useful resource for pigeonpea improvement singh et al 2012 varshney et al 2012 the draft genome sequence information was also generated in chickpea varshney et al 2013 and jute sarkar et al 2017 markerassisted backcrossing was successfully employed in the development of more than 48 cultivars pusa jai kisan variety of mustard was the first product of biotechnology and pusa basmati indian agriculture after independence 761 was the first product of markerassisted breeding in rice improved pusa basmati 1 of rice and chickpea varieties developed for drought tolerance bgm 10216 and fusarium wilt resistance mabc wr sa 1 are other such examples of varietal development using markerassisted backcrossing efforts are also being made to harness cuttingedge technologies like genome editing 2 milestones in field crops research between 1951 and 2021 food grain production increased sixfold the initial phase started with adaptive research for selecting crop varieties that were suited for various agro ecologies the innovations in population selection in field crops paved the way for the development of improved crop varieties many premier institutes such as central rice research institute established in 1946 jute agricultural research laboratory later called central research institute for jute and allied fibres became very active in contributing to the development of improved crop varieties the institutional development for organized research continued and cropbased institutes were established during different plan periods further for accelerating the coordinated research on different crop commodities the all india coordinated research projects aicrp for multilocation evaluation of varieties and technologies was started in 1957 with aicrp on the maize during the same period the project on intensification of regional research in cotton oilseeds and maize pirrcom was established under the indian agricultural research institute iari new delhi and various crop centres were established subsequently during 196070 aicrps on several other crop commodities such as rice cotton pearl millet small millets etc were commenced to generate breeding materials crop production and protection technologies and their testing in multilocation trials the concept of the aicrps which are 60 at present 22 in crop science division has been one of structural contributions in the field of organization and management of multilocation agricultural research in india the first cereal crop hybridization in maize resulted in the development of ganga series ranjit and deccan hybrids the first sorghum hybrid csh1 was released in 1964 india became the first country to develop composite maize in 1967 and successfully developed pearl millet and cotton hybrids first time in the 1970s subsequently hybrids have been developed in other crops including castor safflower rice pigeonpea sunflower and rapeseedmustard a turning point in the indian cotton breeding program was the release of the worlds first hybrid h4 in 1970 which has longstaples with good uniformity during the 19701990s national agriculture research priorities shifted towards conservation and improvement of genetic resources of other crops like oilseeds and pulses to raise productivity the research efforts were supported by the governments ambitious programme on technology mission on oilseeds tmo launched in 1986 and later in 1991 pulses were included under the mission to make it technology mission on oilseeds pulses tmop this resulted in the countrys oilseed production surpassing the target of 18 mt by 198990 and quantum jump in oilseed production from 1083 mt 198586 to 2475 mt 199899 this golden era witnessed the release of 200 hyvs and hybrids of oilseed crops during past six decades the consistent efforts in varietal improvement achievements in field crops in independent india 77led to the development of more than 5508 hyvs of all major crops such as rice wheat cotton oilseeds crops pulses and sugarcane the hyv and their matching production and protection technologies have been the hallmarks of the organized research programme in the country in the past two decades 20012021 efforts were intensified to explore new technologies in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering transgenic technology for cotton has proved to be a gamechanger leading to sharp rise in its area after 2002 which increased to 11 million ha in the last 19 years consequently cotton production almost doubled due to significant increase in its productivity this is an excellent example of the faster adoption of technology for the first time molecular markerassisted selectionpyramiding and backcross were successfully employed a bacterial blightresistant rice variety improved pusa basmati 1 in aromatic rice was developed by introgression of xa13 and xa21 genes from irbb 55 the improved pusa basmati 1 has earned rs 32806 crores in 2018 19 chickpea varieties for drought tolerance bgm 10216 and fusarium wilt resistance mabc wr sa 1 also developed using markerassisted backcrossing the molecular markerassisted technologies so far led to the development of 48 varieties in cereals oilseeds and pulses mostly for incorporating racespecific resistance against key diseases tolerance against abiotic stresses and quality traits after attaining food security indias next major initiative was the adoption of biofortification a process of breeding food crops with better nutritional value intensified efforts in this direction helped to develop about 85 biofortified varieties of different crops by 2021 the programmes were also oriented towards making crops adapted to global climate change development and release of flash floodtolerant rice variety swarna sub 1 and heat tolerant chickpea variety jg 14 have been the remarkable achievements in making progress towards climateresilient agriculture during the present decade 1300 climateresilient varieties of different crops were developed for cultivation by farmers many of these significant outputs could be achieved during different plan periods and ushered green revolution in mid1960s followed by the yellow revolution in the early 1990s the gene revolution in early 2000s and the pulse revolution in the 2010s these revolutions in agriculture transformed india from a net importer of food to a selfsufficient agricultural economy pingali et al 2019 21 green revolution the green revolution one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century helped india triple foodgrain production in about three decades from 1968 to 2000 such miraculous achievement helped to combat food insecurity and poverty despite the population had almost doubled during the same period singh 2014 before the green revolution india was importing 10 mt of food grains under the pl480 scheme during 1966 india launched a megaproject aiming to import large quantities of seeds of semidwarf varieties of wheat from mexico through this project india brought sonara 64 and lerma rojo 64 semidwarf highyielding mexican wheat varieties the seeds of large segregating populations from norman e borlaug were also imported subsequently indian breeders developed semidwarf wheat varieties using the genetic background of indian wheat germplasm indian agriculture after independence 78within a short period of time indian breeders released highyielding varieties of wheat with superior yield quality and resistance to major diseases landmark wheat varieties such as sd 227 c 306 and sonalika changed the prospects for higher harvest in the country wheat varieties such as kalyan sona wl 711 wh 147 up 262 and hd 2189 and hd 2009 were significant contributions along with their production technologies to achieve the green revolution in the country during 80s wheat varieties huw 234 lok1 hd 2285 hd 2329 and up 2338 proved landmarks which with their production technologies had changed the course of the countrys food production similar to wheat green revolution brought exponential growth in rice production in 1966 a new hyv ir 8 was developed at irri philippines by introgression of a dwarfing gene from the taiwanese variety dee geowoogen the ir 8 commonly described as the miracle rice reached india from the philippines the variety had characteristic plant architecture comprised of traits like semidwarf stature photoperiod insensitivity high fertilizer responsivenesslinked high yield potential and medium maturity duration such unique trait combinations in ir 8 offered an unprecedented opportunity for a rice revolution in the country subsequently breeders developed several rice hyvs which were better performing than the ir 8 interestingly rice cultivation from the unconventional area the irrigated indogangetic wheat belt during the late 1960s helped india to fulfil foodgrain requirements especially the medium maturing basmatiderived highyielding fine rice varieties bred at the indian agricultural research institute iari swaminathan 1993 icar 2015 found suitable in an unconventional area such as punjab haryana and uttar pradesh 22 yellow revolution after the green revolution in food grain crops yellow revolution in oilseed crops helped india to achieve near selfsufficiency in edible oils during the early 1990s the intensified efforts in oilseed crops research resulted in a quantum jump in edible oil production from 108 mt 198586 to 247 mt 199899 just in a decade period from 1985 to 1996 area under oilseed cultivation increased from 190 to 260 mha such an increase of 36 in the area resulted in an increase of 125 in production similarly the overall productivity of oilseed crops increased from 570 to 926 kg ha 1 during the yellow revolution over 200 varieties were released the development of hyvs and improved crop technologies helped to achieve significant improvements both in yield and profits to the farmers as a result of the yellow revolution the edible oil imports declined from rs 700 crores in 198586 to rs 300 crore in 199596 the lead in oilseed production during the yellow revolution remained ephemeral as import of edible oil increased considerably from 035 mt 199495 to 1446 mt 20192020 mainly due to increase in per capita consumption growing demand of increasing population and greater freedom of import to the open market through open general licensing ogl the demand for edible oil was 2563 mt in 201920 against domestic production of 1053 mt 703 mt from primary sources and 350 mt from secondary sources necessitating the import of 1510 mt to fill the demand and supply gap achievements in field crops in independent india 7923 sugar revolution india has witnessed sugar revolution during the past 70 years sugarcane production increased from 5705 mt 195051 to 40542 mt 201920 the country has the best infrastructure for rd in sugar crops integrative rd efforts enabled the release of short duration drought and diseasetolerant sugarcane varieties and helped to its spread to central northern and western india in independent india 115 improved varieties have been developed which helped in the steady increase of sugarcane production with improved sugar recovery the wonder sugarcane variety co 0238 which was notified in 2009 with a rare combination of high cane yield and sugar recovery as these are negatively correlated has been benefiting both farmers and the sugar industry the co 0238 showed consistent performance across india in a short period it occupied 80 area during 201213 in uttar pradesh the largest sugarcane growing state from 2016 to 2021 the average cane productivity increased from 690 to 829 t ha 1 24 gene revolution india has been the key player in reaping the harvest of the gene revolution in the early 2000s the partnership of indian private company mahyco with the multinational private company monsanto formulized with the efforts from icar and the department of biotechnology dbt led to the release of the first three genetically modified bt cotton based on transgenic technology in india in 2002 later rch2 hybrid of rasi seeds was approved in 2004 the cotton area got a boost from 77 mha area in 200203 to 134 mha area by 202021 with 94 share of bt cotton hybrids the bt cotton proved a game changer for exports from india india emerged as second major exporter of cotton in 2019 increased cotton production enabled india starting cotton export which earned over three billion us dollars 25 pulse revolution india has witnessed the pulse revolution assuring near selfsufficiency in pulses in the late 2010s the indigenous production of total pulses registered impressive growth during the last five years with the evidence that production jumped from 1626 mt 201516 to 2572 mt 202021 registering impressive growth in productivity from 786 kg ha 1 201617 to 892 kg ha1 202021 at the time of independence india was producing the pulses to the tune of 8 mt only the everhighest production of pulses could be recorded during 202021 2572 mt which was almost twice the production of 1330 mt realized during 199394 the dependency on imports has considerably reduced from 661 mt in 2016 to 246 mt in 2020 several factors contributed to pulse revolution including rd efforts for developing hyv and technologies quality seed extension and policy support amongst these the most tangible effort is in developingpromoting a total of 716 hyvs including 211 in chickpea 145 in pigeonpea 133 in mungbean 67 in urdbean and 46 in lentil released so far with unique attributes and yield potentials to fit into various cropping

world after china india has a production of official figures for 202021 is 124 mt with average productivity of 27 t ha1 of rice ie 41 t ha1 paddy while the rice area in the country remained almost the same 4344 mha in the last seven and half decades a steep increase in rice production has driven the country to a state of exportable surplus fig 1 india has also become a major global exporter both for premium ie basmati and general quality grades of rice while ensuring a steady supply of rice for more than 135 billion of people in the country in the preindependence era rice cultivation was restricted to a single crop per year with low yield and the cultivation was mostly done with photo sensitive lodging disease and pest susceptible traditional verities of very long duration 180 days during the green revolution era with the discovery of the semidwarfing gene source sd1 there was a phenomenal hike in the genetic gain of rice this semidwarf gene supported the green revolution ensuring the food security of the country the first semidwarf high yielding variety developed was tn1 in taiwan which was followed by miracle variety ir8 developed by irri that transformed the fortunes of rice growers across the globe including india during 1966 to 2021 a total of 1199 varieties including 127 hybrids of rice have been released and notified by central subcommittee on crop standards notification and release of varieties the 90s witnessed the development of rice hybrids using parental lines received from irri philippines and improved by several committed research groups in india and multi location testing to validate their superiority over varietal checks in aicrip the hybrids showed superiority over inbred varieties by 1015 in the same decade under aicrip nonbasmati

annual growth rate of 390 the productivity increased by 56 times and area by 293 times during the same period the major area expansion happened in the states of uttar pradesh bihar rajasthan west bengal and madhya pradesh the peninsular region represents about 40 of area and 52 of production the demand for maize will continue to increase in india due to its continued requirement in poultry and livestock feed the growth trend of demand indicated likely requirement of 45 mt by 2030 this requirement may be possible to achieve through scientific interventions like the development and expansion of singlecross hybrid technology development of indian agriculture after independence 86climateresilient maize genotypes and application of novel breeding techniques in maize and mechanization of maize cultivation and popularization of conservation agriculture fig 3 area production and productivity of maize in india the first aicrp for organized multilocation research started on maize in 1957 prior to 1957 the maize productivity was very low at 055 t ha 1 the government of india introduced several maize hybrids from the usa and promising ones were recommended for cultivation after their evaluation however there was no significant impact on productivity due to the temperate nature of these hybrids dent type late maturity and tropical conditions of india the organized research on maize brought about several breakthroughs such as the first set of doublecross hybrids ganga 1 ganga 101 ranjit and deccan in 1961 the first opv jawahar in 1967 the of double cross hybrid histarch ganga 5 ganga safed 2 in 1969 high protein varieties viz shakti rattan and protina with opaque 2 in 1971 first single cross hybrid paras in 1995 and first markerassisted derived hybrid vivek qpm 9 with high lysine and tryptophan in 2008 the composite breeding started in 1967 and continued till 1988 rakshit and chikkapa 2018 six composite cultivars viz vijay kisan amber vikram sona and jawahar were released for cultivation in 1967 using the exotic and native germplasm populations through the systematic crossing these became very popular at farmers fields during 1988 to 1996 the mix of composites double double top top and threeway cross hybrids were followed to maximize the maize productivity till 1988 in india almost 100 maize area was covered by the public bred cultivars or local landraces in the 1990s the single cross hybrid sch program was started with the adoption of a new seed policy and the first single cross hybrid paras was released by the punjab agricultural university ludhiana after 1996 the maize research was shifted to singlecross hybrid development only the maize productivity increased from 18 t ha 1 in 19972006 to 319 t ha1 primarily due adoption of singlecross hybrid technology fig 3 achievements in field crops in independent india 87the discovery of two mutants namely opaque2 o2 containing high lysine and tryptophan and flory2 fl2 having relatively more

about 10 to the countrys food grain requirement millets were traditionally consumed as food but due to the push given to food security through the green revolution in the 1960s millets were rendered as orphan crops and thus are less consumed and almost forgotten before the green revolution millets made up around 40 of all cultivated grains which has dropped to around 20 over the years despite the many benefits of growing millets there has been a downward trend in the cultivation of millets in the country in the past six decades the area under millets has gone down by 6257 dropping from 3634 mha 195556 to around 1383 mha 201920 yet the production target of all millet crops is maintained with an increase in productivity per hectare over 4 times in pearl millet and more than 2 times in sorghum finger millet and small millet crops over the decadesachievements in field crops in independent india 89after independence enormous progress has been made to improve the productivity of sorghum pearl millet and small millets by developing highyielding cultivars and hybrids in fact sorghum and pearl millet hybrids established the seed industry in the country hybrids were successfully developed in sorghum often crosspollinated crop and pearl millet crosspollinated crop due to the availability of the male sterility system for hybrid seed production private entrepreneurs and companies have also contributed significantly to the development of superior hybrids and their commercialization in pearl millet forage sorghum and grain sorghum through icar aicrp on pearl millet a total of 206 varieties and hybrids were released for cultivation in different agroecological zones of the country it is the first crop where mas strategies and tools were applied to develop improved

also provides direct employment to 037 million workers in organized mills and diversified activities in jute trading india is the largest producer and consumer of jute and jute products about 85 of jute production is consumed in the domestic market mainly for sacking saha and hazra 2008 government of india under the jute packaging materials compulsory use in packing commodities act 1987 has made it mandatory that 100 of food grains and 20 of sugar are to be packed in jute sacks produced of jute grown in the country during 201920 the jute was grown in an area of 68 million ha with a production of dry fibres of 95 million bales 171 mt with the average productivity of 253 t ha 1 in the year 195051 the country had around 057 mha jute area with an annual production of 331 million bales of 180 kg each and productivity of 104 t ha1 which was insufficient to cater the need of the jute industries in the country up to early seventies the increasing demand of jute fibre as raw material was satisfied through the increase in the acreage of the crop in the country as a result the area almost doubled from 057 m ha in 195051 to 108 mha in 197071 the production of raw jute also almost doubled from 331 million bales in 195051 to 619 million bales in 197071 the productivity however stagnated around indian agriculture after independence 104105 t ha1 the jute area marginally decreased from 130 mha in 198081 to 102 mha in 199091 but the productivity increased sharply by almost 50 to 163 t ha1 leading to increased production of 923 million bales the area further dipped by 17 during 200001 to 201011 but the production stabilized around 106 million bales the credit goes to rise in productivity by 17 during the same period due to the introduction of new varieties in the production system supported with improved locationspecific technologies after the partition of india in 1947 the major jute growing area went to east pakistan now bangladesh whereas the jute industries remained in the eastern part of india the major challenge for indian jute breeders was to develop varieties suitable for new areas having wider adaptation after 1947 research on jute were carried out initially at rice research station chinsurah hooghly of west bengal from 194852 the jute agricultural research institute came into existence at barrackpore west bengal during 1953 and was renamed as central research institute for jute and allied fibres in 1990 the concerted breeding efforts in postindependent india resulted in the development of 47 varieties of jute the release and commercial cultivation of jute variety jro 524 in 1977 converted the existing white jute area to tossa jute area tj 40 released in 1983 was the first commercial tossa jute variety developed through mutation breeding

major fodder crops are cultivated in around 90 million ha which has almost remained static for the last 34 decades an additional 48 m ha of wastelands and degraded soils 12 mha pasture lands have the potential to be used for increasing forage resources grazingbased livestock production is also vital as nearly 30 pastoral communities in hilly or aridsemiarid regions are dependent on these lands the demand and supply scenario in fodder crops shows a deficit in both green and dry fodder with varying estimates by different agencies recent estimate indicates 23 deficiency of green fodder and 14 of dry fodder roy et al 2019 in india forage research gained momentum in postindependent india after the establishment of icarindian grassland and fodder research institute in 1962 and aicrp on forage crops in 1970 since then more than 210 varieties of fodder crops were developed and recommended for cultivation in different zones specific farming situations with focus on high yield quality biotic and abiotic stress tolerance as well as the specific need of the zonelocation and fitting in various cropping situations the lucerne improvement programme started in the late sixties resulting in many popular cultivars such as chetak sirsa 9 anand2 anand3 rl88 co3 and co4 etc variety mescavi was the first release of berseem as an introduction at iari new delhi dr m s swaminathan and the group were

strategies 411 genome editing precise genome editing has great significance in crop improvement programs different crops have been benefitted by genome editing through the use of engineered nucleases viz zinc finger nucleases zfns meganucleases transcription activatorlike effector nuclease talens and recently introduced clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeatscrisprassociated system crisprcas etc the rapid technological breakthroughs and examples of successful exploration for crop improvement have provided a great novel and valuable platform for biotechnologists geneticists and plant breeders to work in a team for greater gains in creating novel variability in traits of interest and eventually assisting in enhanced and sustainable crop production the emphasis is being given to incorporate genome editing in crop improvement programmes recent advances in the development of a genome editing technique using crisprcas9 are providing hope for developing and cultivating new varieties of agricultural crops the government of india in its recent notification in 2022 provided the exemption to genome edited plants falling in the categories of sdn 1 and sdn 2 which are free of exogenous introduced dna this arrangement will accelerate the development of varieties using genome editing technologies 412 genomic selection with the substantial reduction in cost and high throughput techniques based on single nucleotide polymorphism snp enabled genotyping a large number of plants in a short time and has created the unique opportunity to harness the tools of genomics for enhancing the genetic gains at whole genome levels instead of following the traditional estimation of breeding value from phenotypes the calculation of genomic estimated breeding value gebv helps to select the best lines at different stages of the breeding programme genomic selection may be considered as an advanced form of mas with high reproducibility and in this case simulation strategy is followed to predict the expected phenotype of progeny based on its genotype spindel et al 2018 in our country genomicsassisted breeding is yet to be started extensively few recent initiatives such as excellence in breeding eib indian agriculture after independence 108platform of a consultative group of international agricultural research cgiar and indian council of agricultural research icar led consortium through financial support from bill and melinda gates foundation bmgf the consortium is aiming for the application of nextgeneration breeding genotyping and digitalization approaches for improving the genetic gain in indian staple crops however the initiatives are still in the infant stage 413 accelerating the genetic gain through speed breeding food fodder and fibre production needs to increase in the future in order to meet the demand of the increasing human population the development of new improved cultivars with higher yield and resistance to major pests and diseases are needed quickly to meet the increasing demand in order to accelerate the breeding program the concept of recently developed speed breeding method which uses environment controlled growth chambers that can accelerate plant development for research purposes including phenotyping of adult plant traits mutant studies and transformation developed in wheat and other crops offers great scope for improvement in other crops as it can reduce the generation time shorten the breeding cycle enabling rapid development of advanced stable lines mapping populations screening for identification of donor sources for traitshasten backcrossing and pyramiding of traits mutant studies and faster development of improved cultivars watson et al 2018 fiyaz et al 2020 wanga et al 2021 speed breeding increases the number of generations per year instead of conventional breeding methods which usually take 1015 years as only 12 generations could be grown per year for most of the crop species thus it has the potential to reduce the time required for cultivar development release and commercialization watson et al 2018 wanga et al 2021 speed breeding facilitates to grow six generations of rice bread wheat durum wheat chickpea barley pea four generations of brassica species and two generations of groundnut per year in case of rice speed breeding through single seed descent ssd is a time and costeffective breeding method where a single seed per line in a segregating population is only advanced to the next generation these plants are then grown in the greenhouse where several generations can be completed within a short period in india speed breeding is still in a nascent stage and protocol standardization is undergoing in a few institutes like icariirr icarnrri icariari and igkv raipur 42 transgenics despite having single genetically modified gm crop released for the cultivation india stands fifth in the world for area under transgenics the single gmo crop cotton is developed by incorporating genes from the bacillus thuringiensis the b thuringiensis is a soil bacterium harboring a gene found to provide resistance against heliothis bollworm insect pests of cotton at present gm crops are grown globally on 1903 mha however in other parts of the world soybean transgenics are making the highest share in the worlds total gm crop area 494 followed by maize 313 cotton 126 and canola 53 isaaa 2020 the most frequently used gm traits in these crops included insect achievements in field crops in independent india 109resistance and herbicide tolerance in india two gm crops bollgard iiroundup ready flex bgiirrf cotton and mustard are under regulatory consideration the bollgard ii roundup ready flex bgiirrf cotton incorporating bt as well as glyphosatetolerant genes is developed by monsanto whereas the transgenic mustard harbouring three alien genes that enable higher yields through hybridisation is developed by delhi universitys centre for genetic manipulation of crop plants both the crops have undergone all the mandated biosafety research and open field trials their commercial release is yet to be made besides transgenics developed by public and private institutions are ready for field trials in other crops viz castor rice maize sorghum and sugarcane efforts need to be continued in the development of transgenics for achieving difficult objectives of crop improvement by harnessing new science once the regulatory considerations are fulfilled in each case society will derive benefits from this novel approach of crop improvement 43 diversification and value addition currently research efforts on the development of valueaddition are gaining attention as there has been a continuous demand for such products by the consumers india is known for its rich genetic diversity and improvement of the genetic potential and yield is the need of the hour while retaining the original key trait such as aroma nutrition and grain quality indian rice breeding is incomplete without mentioning basmati and other aromatic rice while basmati rice has a special market in international trade earning annually to the tune of rs 29849 crores of foreign exchange aromatic shortgrain rice has a niche for the domestic market in addition there are several types of specialtycoloured rice such as glutinous chakuwa joha black etc in different parts of the country also there is a demand for valueadded products of rice such as beaten ricepoha rice in central india puffed rice in southern and western india parboiled red and medicinal rice in kerala sticky and black rice in the north eastern part of india 44 adaptation to climate change in the present scenario to overcome the effect of climate change farmers have already begun to make adaptations to deal with the effects of climate change the most common form of adaptation made by the farmers is the use of new varieties that can withstand the effect of climate change other forms of adaptation include the use of water pumps adjusting planting times using natural pesticides using organic fertilizers and altering cropping patterns further mitigating and adaptation strategies such as intercropping alternate wetting and drying precise farming improved tillage and integrated farming system are needed to mitigate the negative effects of climate change rice cultivation significantly contributes to climate change efficient strategies are required to limit the methane emission from the rice field the application of anaerobic methanotrops to oxidize the ch 4 seems to be an effective approach similarly the development of highyielding and climatesmart rice cultivars by using different new breeding genomic tools and genetic engineering need to be priorities indian agriculture after independence 11045 partnerships linkages consortium approach involving publicprivate partnership for germplasm sharing and utilization is warranted similarly sharing of advance breeding lines among breeders for desired traits can lead to the development of varieties suitable for different agroecological conditions deployment of appropriate cultivars based on systematic screening for tolerance to key biotic stresses at different hotspot locations through partnerships can help avert crop failures due to locationspecific pests and diseases partnership programs for the dissemination of management strategies in various programmes have paid rich dividends in recent years linkages with nbri ppvfra nba dbt dst apeda dac imd isro remote sensing application centres and cgiar institutes can go a long way in fostering research and development 46 policies india has a constitutionally empowered national food security act 2013 to protect the poor and needy consumers from food deficit and food crisis in the realm of flaring global prices while taking into consideration the need for ensuring food security in the country the need of the hours is reformulating of policies so as to strengthen the efficiency in supply and demand sides in agricultural sector in india this can indeed lead to faster growth and greater environmental sustainability of agriculture the reforms in minimum support price msp determination and implementation decentralization of the revamped public distribution system pds and introduction of food stamps essential commodities and storage according to size of inventory of the processing units etc may serve larger policy goals in the agricultural sector the most important target is to reduce the costs of procurement distribution and storage operations achieving this goal will help to reduce the governments budgetary expenses to a great extent another important policy issue is delinking of the procurement price from the msp the msp thought to provide protection against price risk at the harvest should be decoupled from its primary purpose of augmenting the farmer income at the same time pds could be slowly eliminated and to ensure food for poor expansion of a food coupon system can be implemented the food coupon system will allow the poor to purchase food at the prevailing market prices in the new regime of ipr the exchange of genetic material for the research purpose should be made more liberal and very clear guidelines in benefit sharing to the partners to sustain the food and nutritional security support of the government as well as strong private industry is required in the form of strengthening both conventional as well as innovative breeding technologies 5 conclusion in postindependent india the development made during and after green revolution has transformed indian agriculture from a shiptomouth status in the 1960s to a right to food situation at present in todays scenario of food sufficiency goal is shifted from cerealintensive food security to nutrientrich diet security to ensure nourishment and achievements in field crops in independent india 111combat malnutrition the goal of zero hunger by 2030 can be achieved with sustainable development despite witnessing green yellow and pulse revolutions and having attained impressive food production of 31451 mt in 202122 india has to continue advancement for increasing crop productivity to sustain food security newer methods of harnessing the heterosis speeding up the breeding processes and insulating crop varieties against diseases and insects are to be adopted for accelerating the genetic gains in staple crops the priority is being given to improving the productivity and stability of rainfed crops like pulses oilseeds and millets and more efficient and sustainable use of increasingly scarce land water and germplasm resources intensive research efforts are needed to make the crops nutritive and resilient to climate change considerable progress has been made in the basic understanding of natural phenomena however the acquired indepth knowledge helping to understand the scientific facts is yet to be explored effectively for crop improvements the gap between the advent of new techniques and their appropriate implementation is widening integration of different approaches and science branches seems to be an efficient way to close this gap more notably integrated omics approaches available resources data centric intelligence and translational and implementation strategies are being extensively employed for crop improvements continuously increasing the number of omics facilities like phenomics proteomics ionomics and highthroughput sequencing in different indian states indicates technological adaptation and capacitybuilding efforts in the country similarly the development of speed breeding platforms for different crops is ensuring the demandbased timely delivery of crop breeding products efficient exploration of scientific

research new delhi 2icarindian institute of horticultural research bengaluru karnataka summary horticulture has been a major contributor towards the substantial progress made towards food and nutrition security in india since independence the much noticeable after 2005 in the recent years horticulture sector has become a driver of economic growth and slowly taking shape of an organized industry with key linkages to seed business valueaddition and export leading to jobfull growth horticulture provides an opportunity for much needed diversification and intensification for adequate nutritious food and augmenting the income of the farmers horticulture research in india initiated in 1954 with the establishment of division of botany at iari over years several institutions and aicrps were operationalized with the research agenda relevant to the national plans and priorities for dedicated development in horticulture today horticultural research is conducted through 23 institutesdirectoratesnrcs 13 aicrps and 6 network projectsoutreach programmes and is one of the most organized rd setups in the nares the horticulture in india comprises of diverse crops and commodities ie fruits including nut plantation crops vegetables including potato tuber crops mushroom ornamental plants spices and medicinal and aromatic plants honey bee rearing bamboo etc has emerged as major alternatives for diversification and are contributing 31 to the agricultural gdp research on developing new varieties and management aspects of the horticultural crops over the past 75 years has contributed immensely to the growth of this sector at present this sector is increasingly moving towards industries and commercialization however newer challenges such as emerging pests and diseases declining and degrading land and water resources climate change scarcity of water resources natural calamities high costs of agricultural inputs and transport competing use of land and water and decline of investment in agriculture are emerging needing immediate action promotion of crop diversification in smallholder horticultural farming had been successful in many asian countries and technology being size neutral effective technology transfer paid quick dividends 1 introduction after independence in 1947 the immediate priority was to attain food selfsufficiency in staple crops like wheat and rice the green revolution brought the food security through technological interventions and intensive use of inputs such as high yielding varieties of achievements in horticulture in independent india 115seeds chemical fertilizers pesticides and expansion of irrigation canal networks during 198090 when gains of green revolution were plateauing and the luxury of area expansion under field crops gradually drying up a vigorous search for alternative sources of growth in agriculture sector started the highvalue horticulture crops were identified as important source for growth in farm income accordingly viii five year plan 199297 allocated rs 1000 crores for the firsttime giving priority to this sector this policy push has helped in achieving a compound annual growth rate cagr of 482 in horticulture above the target of 4 set by national agricultural policy in 2000 horticulture production increased 13fold from 25 mt during 195051 to 331 mt during 202021 surpassing food grain production ministry of agriculture 2021 with 18 area the sector contributes about 33 of the gross value added in the agricultural gdp currently india is the second largest producer of horticultural crops next to china contributing 114 and 118 to worlds fruit and vegetable baskets respectively india is the largest producer of ginger and okra amongst vegetables and ranks second in production of potato onion cauliflower brinjal and cabbage amongst fruits the country ranks first globally in production of banana 367 papaya 436 and mango 404 ranks second in cashew and third in citrus during 202021 india exported fruits and vegetables worth rs 9941 crores in spite of the global pandemic this sector is being considered as a driver of economic growth and gradually turning into an organized industry with key linkages to seed business value addition and exports it is also well established that horticulture is to play a key role in doubling the farmers income along with meeting the muchneeded nutritional security it is strongly believed that the consistent and rapid increase in production and availability of horticultural crops shall over period of time translate into bridging the gap between the nutritional security of the country visvis global average 2 milestones in horticultural research systematic horticulture research in india was initiated in 1954 when the division of botany icariari was established for carrying out systematic research on fruit vegetable and ornamental crops over years several independent institutions and programmes were launched with research agenda relevant to national plans and priorities for the horticulture development including 10 central institutes 6 directorates 7 nrcs 13 aicrps and 6 network projects outreach

karnataka is exporting fresh mallika mangoes to the usa parts of the european union uae kuwait japan malaysia singapore and south korea while gujarat is exporting it to eu countries along with kesar 312 dogridge rootstock of grape the grape rootstock dogridge vitis champinii was developed to overcome the adverse effects of drought and salinity but also to improve the yield and quality of major commercial scion varieties in addition the raisin recovery from the grapes harvested from the vines grown on dogridge rootstock is higher to the tune of 25 compared to own rooted vines yield gain was in the range of 510 while reduction in cultivation costs was in the range of 1015 across major grape growing regions of maharashtra and karnataka there were other intangible benefits such as improved quality of the berries and reduction in the total water requirement for the crop today more than 90 of the area under grape cultivation in india is on dogridge rootstock employing this rootstock training to y trellis developing subcanes and proper scheduling of growth regulators have increased bc ratio both in domestic and export grapes to the extent of 231 and 5261 respectively employing dogridge rootstock training to y trellises developing sub canes and proper scheduling of growth regulators has increased the productivity from 1011 t ha 1 during 199091 to 22 t ha1 during 201819 the total value of grape crop raised under this technology currently is rs 94560 crores exports of fresh grapes earned a foreign exchange of us 33491 million rs 2335 crores while exports of raisins earned us 26217 million during 2018 nearly 90 of these exports are based on the fruits obtained from grapes cultivated on dogridge rootstock indian agriculture after independence 122 grape crop raised on dogridge rootstock training to y trellis developing sub canes and timely scheduling of growth regulators 313 improved varieties and crop regulation technology of pomegranate mpkv rahuri has developed bhagawa and superbhagwa which were tested under aicrp arid zone fruits and found to be superior over existing varieties like ganesh and arakta both in terms of yield and fruit quality it has recorded in case of bhagawa that a higher fruit weight 3206 g with attractive bright red colour of fruit rind in comparison to ruling variety ganesh 29780 g it possessed a higher mean weight of aril per fruit 22080 g and higher juice recovery from 100 arils 276 ml compared to ganesh 2360 ml it is the most widely adopted pomegranate variety in the country recently a biofortified variety solapur lal possessing higher contents of iron zinc and vit c has been developed saroj and kumar 2019 bhagwa has replaced the earlier ruling high yielding variety ganesh the popularity of this variety and its impact can be witnessed through tremendous increase in pomegranate area under cultivation 12291 production 27915 productivity 7012 and export 38217 as compared to those of 200304 today more than one lakh families are earning livelihood from this variety in india further employing crop regulation during mrig hasth and ambia bahar has ensured availability of pomegranate fruits throughout the year management strategies for major diseases like bacterial blight disease and wilt complex of pomegranate have been instrumental in popularizing this crop 314 improved varieties and agronomy of banana several new varieties bred with a specific biotic or abiotic stress tolerance have become popular leading to wider adoption and increased production of this crop over years for example popular varieties like kaveri haritha are tolerant to fusarium wilt foc race 2 kaveri saba is a drought tolerant variety and suitable for cultivation in saline sodic soils fruits of bhagwa variety of pomegranateachievements in horticulture in independent india 123ph ranging from 88 to 90 and kaveri kanya is tolerant to foc race 1 further unique landraces namely manoranjitham and hill bananas which were nearing extinction in the natural habitats were rejuvenated facilitated hill banana growers federation in acquiring gi tag for the hill bananas virupakshi and sirumalai rani and kumar 2013 a slight reorientation of planting geometry using optimized clump management coupled with fertigation increased 40 plant population per unit area resulting in 30 increase in productivity and 25 reduction in water and fertilizer inputs the bc ratio increased from 251 to 351 over the past decade this technology has spread to 20 lakh ha 30 of total area in states like maharashtra madhya pradesh gujarat andhra pradesh and tamil nadu during the past three decades the area and production has increased substantially in banana and india has emerged as the largest producer of banana in the world meeting the domestic demand and nutritional security the main impact of improved varieties can be seen as increase in the national acreage by 75 production by 68 and productivity by 172 of banana in the country which has put the nation in top slot contributing to 21 of the total banana produced in the world with an annual business of more than rs 60000 crores recently indias export in banana is steadily increasing with the help of technology awareness icarnrcb under the ppp mode along with apeda has successfully accomplished the export of nendran further sea protocol for long distance transport of traditional bananas like nendran and red banana have been standardized 315 temperate horticulture in india temperate horticulture crops are grown in himalayan states in the north and northeast it plays a vital role in providing nutritional and economic security of the region horticulture in these states forms the backbone of economy by providing direct or indirect employment to about 810 million people and generating revenue to the tune of rs 10000 crores annually among temperate horticultural crops apple pear peach plum kiwi fruit apricot cherry almond and walnut in fruits are important with apple walnut and pear sharing major area while in vegetables temperate cultivars of cole crops bulb and root crops capsicum peas high value leafy vegetables like lettuce parsley

fore casting late blight is the most devastating disease of potato because of its fast spread resulting in wipe out of entire crop in a few days if proper preventive measures are not adopted the average losses caused by late blight have been estimated to the tune of 15 annually a computerized late blight forecasting system known as jhulsacast singh et al 2000 was developed for uttar pradesh for forecasting first appearance of late blight it has predicted appearance of the disease before its actual appearance in up during the last 13 years studies have shown that prophylactic fungicide sprays help in protecting the crop with a minimal crop loss 10 using recommended spray schedule even in epiphytotic years as against 3040 losses in crop that was not protected prophylactically icar cpri has developed a panindia late blight forecasting model named indoblightcast the expected reduction in crop losses by the use of indoblightcast singh et al 2016 in last five years would have been

arka microbial consortium for better nutrient mobilization and penicillium pinophilum for potash and phosphorous solubilization developed for pomegranate have been commercialized in addition food safety and referral laboratories have been established in major horticultural institutes to monitor pesticide residues 4 way forward the horticulture sector is plagued with some persistent problems like unavailability of quality planting material threats of emerging insect pests and diseases and nutrient deficiencies increased frequency of abiotic stresses like salinity and drought flooding hailstorm and high temperature lack of postharvest handling along with processing infrastructure poor processing and lack of storage infrastructure is a deterrent for farmers as prices crash in glut season insufficient investments and absence of organized and regulated marketing system besides conventional handling of horticultural produce are other drawbacks which result in poor and uncertain monitory returns to the growers further from food shortage to food surplus india endeavors to create revolution in horticulture horticulture has emerged as an important business opportunity for growers processors retailers and exporters under these circumstances we need to look for disruptive technologies to deal with the challenges of future research that enables growers to adopt innovative practices and technologies lowering the costs of production are the need of the hour cost reduction can be achieved through deployment of novel technologies which allow more efficient use of inputs including water nutrient energy and labour the power of artificial intelligence unmanned aerial vehicles gis and remote sensing should be pursued for inducting precision in farming smart agroengineering tools and gadgets to enhance indian agriculture after independence 132efficiency of nutrient and water use plant protection interventions and to develop location specific precision farming regimes promotion of weatherresilient crop varieties vigilant biosecurity system and strengthening climate risk information should be accorded top priority to minimize crop losses because of natural disasters emphasis on use of renewable and alternate energy sources application of sensors and nanotechnologies safe and natural farming in identified agroecological zones for efficient resource management intensive and alternate production systems like vertical farming genome sequencing initiatives in icar of major crops like mango coconut pomegranate oil palm and potato shall come handy in their breeding efforts challenges are for brining precision in crop improvement using omics and gene editing tools production systems with more application of use of ais space and gis technologies too 5 conclusion to achieve the greatest impact from investments in research and innovation there is a need for coordinated strategic approach by all stakeholders to achieve a balance of both short and longterm goals it is expected that current research programs of icar would lead to a technology driven growth for safe production of nutritious food better environmental and nutritional security higher profitability and selfreliance in horticultural crops and thereby rise to make india kuposhanmukt and atmanirbhar besides this sector has enormous potential for meeting much needed

welldesigned research programs and concerted scientific efforts have made it possible for animal sector to touch the new horizons the development of high yielding crosses of different livestock species viz cattle 4 sheep 5 pig 9 chicken 6 japanese quail 6 guinea fowl 3 and turkey 2 have played pivotal role in augmenting animal production molecular genetics approaches have helped in pathways analysis and identification of genes related to productiondisease resistance traits biotechnological interventions such as transgenesis gene knock down using rnai technology gene editing using crisprcas9 etc are opening new vistas of improving production andor quality of products the countrywide genetic selection and breeding programs under aicrp network projects have increased the production of milk egg meat and fiber and helped in conservation of native germplasm so far 202 breeds livestock 177 poultry 22 and dogs 3 have been gazette notified feed costs about 70 of animal production therefore in order to reduce the cost of animal feed more than 30 alternative feed resources with appropriate supplementation level were identified along with intensifying the efforts for improving nutrient availability and feed efficiency in order to mitigate methane production in ruminants several products such as harit dhara tamarin plus avivatika etc were developed livestock products technologies have enriched the food basket with a wide range of products and so far about 66 products have been commercialized the investigations have yielded vital genetic and management clues for climate resilience in animal production still there exists a wide gap between demand and availability of animal products and feed resources 1 introduction livestock is the integral part of indian agrarian society livestock including poultry sector contribute directly through milk meat egg wool and fiber production as well as provide achievements in livestock and poultry production in independent india 135employment to about 188 of the indian population and livelihood to twothird of rural community these animals have played crucial role in the evolution of crop cultigens and expansion of agriculture system by providing the draught power for agricultural works and contributing to the soil fertility it is estimated that 30 of the total protein requirement for humanbeings is derived from the animal husbandry the poultry sector has undergone a paradigm shift in the structure and operation transforming from a mere backyard activity into a major commercial agribased industry over a period of five decades animal husbandry is one of the fastest growing sectors contributing over 256 to agrigdp gross domestic product and 411 to overall gdp india is the highest milk producer 1984 million tons mt 3 rd largest producer of eggs 1145 b and 6th largest in poultry meat production 434 mt in the world the current production of livestock and poultry has increased several folds in comparison to 195051 viz 117 times in milk 624 times in eggs 133 times in wool and 462 times in meat since 2000 besides with 1416 mt fish production in 201920 india is the second largest fish producing country honey production in the year 2021 in india was 125 lakhs mt the milk group has greatest share 665 in value of output of livestock at current price basis followed by the meat group 2327 whereas share of egg wool hair and hide skin were 313 005 and 058 respectively bahs 2020 the country has witnessed three revolutions viz white revolution for milk production in 197696 silver revolution for egg and poultry production in 2000 and red revolution for meat production in 19802008 in spite of spectacular growth in animal sector there exists a wide gap between demand and availability of meat and eggs in india the present per capita per annum availability of egg is 86 which is far below the icmr recommendation of 180 eggs similarly for meat percapita per annum availability is 645 kg against the recommendation of 11 kg meat per annum the gap in demand and availability generate pressure on resources and demand intensification of r d to augment productivity in order to alleviate hunger and malnutrition in the postindependence era the scientific breakthroughs and technology interventions have played key role for continuous and sustainable growth in the livestock table 1 and poultry sector table 2 development of high yielding livestock and poultry breeds nutritional interventions and advanced reproductive technologies were instrumental in augmenting production and productivity in india high density snp chips were developed for future application in genomic selection in indigenous livestock and poultry the government policies and schemes also supported the largescale breeding and dissemination of the high yielding improved germplasms throughout the country the feed technologies have also helped in reducing the cost of animal and poultry feed along with augmenting nutrient availability and improving the feed efficiency a number of alternate feed resources supplements and additives were identified and standardized for formulation of lowcost rations as well as for substitution of antibiotic growth promoters in feed the feed formulations and practices were also standardized for mitigating methane emission and stress especially during summers the assisted reproductive technologies arts such as artificial insemination ai estrus synchronization embryo transfer technology ett ovum pickup invitro fertilization opuivf and animal cloning were standardized indian agriculture after independence 136and perfected for faster multiplication and maximum utilization of superior germplasm the development of new generation vaccines diagnostics and drugs and innovative surgical procedures have led to reduction in morbidity and mortality losses and thus enhancing the overall production from livestock and poultry species the well structured research programs of icar played pivotal role in technology driven progress in livestock sector in the country during 1962 to 1999 icar established 19 research institutes in different parts of the country to address the research innovation and technology requirement for improving animal health and production two major animal science institutes ie ivri 1989 and ndri 1923 were established

local breeds and 40005000 crossbred sheep were produced around pune for superior quality wool production national commission on agriculture 1976 nilgiri a fine wool breed of sheep was evolved in the nilgiri hills of tamil nadu crossbreeding of indigenous sheep with romney marsh was undertaken both in plains and hilly areas hisardale a fine wool breed with about 75 exotic inheritance was evolved by crossing of bikaneri ewes with merino rams at government livestock farm at hisar haryana agriculture university 1983 kashmir merino was evolved by crossing gaddi bhakarwal rampur bushair poochhi kamah and gurez with merino sheep breeding work under aicrp for fine wool was started in 1971 at cswri the breeds involved were exotic finewool breeds soviet merino and rambouillet and the indigenous breedsgaddi nali chokla patanwadi nilgiri and bonpala the new strains of sheep were named as avivastra nalisynthetic chokla synthetic nilgirisynthetic patanwadisynthetic and gaddisynthetic crossbreeding to improve mutton production involved exotic mutton breeds dorest and suffolk and indigenous breeds were malpura sonadi muzzaffarnagari nellore mandya deccani and madras red avimaas mutton synthetic lambs attained 25 kg body weight at 130 days rambouillet was superior to other exotic breeds in crossbreeding experiments awassi was crossed with native malpura sheep at cswri avikanagar in 1994 the crossbred am exhibited improvement in body weight and feed efficiency 321 avishaan a prolific sheep developed at icarcswri a crossbreeding scheme was started in 1997 to introgress the prolificacy gene fecb from small sized prolific sheep breed garole of sunderban area of west bengal into nonprolific large size mutton sheep breed malpura of rajasthan and garole x malpura halfbreds were produced with twinning percentage of 50 the fecb gene carrier garole x malpura halfbreds males were backcrossed with malpura dam to produce the gmm having 25 garole and 75 malpura inheritance later in 2008 patanwadi inheritance was introduced to increase the availability of milk to newly born lambs in this crossbreeding programme gmm having fec bb gene was used as sire and patanwadi as a dam breed to produce triple indigenous breed cross with 125 garole 375 malpura and 50 patanwadi inheritance in which fecb gene has been introgressed successfully the high performing triple breed cross avishaan was released by cswri on 4 th january 2016 avishaan exhibited high prolificacy 744 litter size 18 and annual lambing avishaan ewes produced 46 more mutton compared to monotocus malpura achievements in livestock and poultry production in independent india 141945 body weights at 3 and 6 months averaged 165 and 279 kg respectively with post weaning and adult survivability above 98 with fecb gene inheritance 33 goat crossbreeding in goat with exotic breeds was started to increase milk meat and mohair production exotic breeds such as alpine saanen and toggenberg were used for improved milk production and angora for mohair production alpine and toggenberg were crossed with sirohi for improving the milk and reproduction performance of the local breeds saanen breed showed better performance with both the indigenous breeds than alpine saanen and malabari cross showed an improvement of 128 in milk yield over malabari saanenbeetal crosses 75 exotic inheritance were the best showing 1034 improvement over purebred beetal aicrp 1985 alpine sirohi and toggenburg sirohi exhibited higher lactation yield than sirohi subsequently it was observed that purebred selection was more effective than crossbreeding for improving growth and meat production jamunapari and beetal were used as improver breeds to cross with black bengal assam local sirohi and sangamneri beetal black bengal cross performed better than jamunapari black bengal cross the combining ability of four important indigenous breeds was analysed in the pl480 project involving jamunapari black bengal barbari and beetal breeds indian goat breeds do not produce mohair however crossbreeding of sangamneri and gaddi with angora breed yielded mohair crossbreds with 875 exotic inheritances were found to be the best for mohair production under indian conditions however crosses had higher mortality and mohair production was uneconomical aicrp 1985 overall the crossbreeding did not prove viable as the crossbred were not stable and could not sustain the production in subsequent generations majority of goat breeds and nondescript goats in india carry a b e and f alleles at s1casein locus allele a 068 to 100 and b 0098 to 023 associated with better casein yield had higher gene frequencies allele f was observed in beetal marwari chegu and nondescript goats of mp in less than 1 of population furthermore the null allele cno of casein which is associated with no synthesis of s2 casein protein having higher frequency in norwegian goats and crossbreeding may result in inheritance of this allele into indigenous goat breeds alpine and saanen goats from france showed s1cne and s1cnf allele frequencies as 034 and 041 respectively togenburg appenzeller and verzasca breeds of switzerland had s1 cnf frequency was 069 044 and 062 respectively indian goats have higher frequency of a and b alleles indicating better allelic combination for the higher milk protein yield 34 pig exotic breed pigs were imported in india in ivfiveyear plan 19701971 with the launch of aicrp on pig and the main objective was studying the performance of purebred exotic pigs under existing managemental conditions and stabilizing their performance in indian agriculture after independence 142different agroclimatic conditions of the country consequent to slow progress of genetic improvement in indigenous pigs and higher demand for pork crossbreeding of native pigs with exotic boars gained momentum in different parts of the country the icarnational research center on pig and the centres of aicrp on pig developed nine high yielding crossbred pig varieties suitable for different agroclimatic condition of the country as given below 1 rani 50 hampshire 50 ghungroo developed

average litter size at birth of crossbred varieties ranges from 810 compared to 56 in indigenous pigs average body weight at slaughter age 8 months in indigenous pigs is 4050 kg whereas the crossbreds attain 7590 kg at slaughter age assuming rearing of one indigenous sow with average litter size of 55 and average body weight of 45 kganimal a farmer can produce approximately 250 kg pork in one year and earn rs 25000 by selling of pig rs 100 kg 1 of pork on the other hand keeping improved crossbred sow with average litter size of 95 and average body weight of 75 kganimal a farmer produces about 700 kg pork and earn rs 70000 per year 35 poultry poultry is one of the major sectors of agriculture in india icar has pivotal role in shaping up both organized and unorganized poultry sectors through its research programmes including aicrp and poultry seed projects and producing highly skilled manpower for manning the indian poultry sector specialized breeding programmes have resulted in achievements in livestock and poultry production in independent india 143development of high yielding poultry strains which have revolutionized the indian poultry sector both the icar institutes along with aicrp centres have developed many high yielding backyard chicken varieties such as vanaraja gramapriya srinidhi janapriya vanashree carishyama carinirbhik cariupcari cari hitcari pratapdhan kamrupa narmadanidhi jharshim himsamridhi etc for enhancing backyard poultry production in the country these high yielding chicken varieties lay 130140 eggs and attain 15 kg body weight at 1214 weeks of age and are best suited for hot and humid climate carinirbheek has been enlisted by the fao as a bird suitable for backyard poultry some of these varieties are enlisted as low input technologies lit under national livestock mission nlm the institutes aicrp centres also developed commercial layer varieties such as krishilayer ili80 ilm90 ilr90 and atulya 290315 eggs and commercial broiler like b77 caribrodhanraja caribrovishal ibl80 ibb 83 krishibro etc 2 kg at 7 weeks for intensivesemiintensive poultry production in the country standardized package of practices developed by the institutes together with the high yielding strains have contributed to spectacular growth rates in layer broiler and backyard poultry production furthermore the turkey and japanese quail backyard population in india has increased by 49 and 564 in 2019 20 th livestock census as compared to 2012 19th livestock census genetic improvement and popularization of the diversified poultry species such as duck japanese quail turkey guinea fowl has also been undertaken every year both the icar institutes aicrp and megaseed project centres are supplying 30 lakhs improved chicken germplasm including parents to the different stakeholder during last 10 years icar has supplied more than 25 crores of backyard chicken germplasm from which around 2 lakhs farmers every year across the country are benefitted the estimated profit by the improved low input technology birds was found to be rs 88370 lakhs in last five years 4 genetic improvement of indigenous germplasm 41 cattle the icarcentral institute for research on cattle circ meerut has been implementing the indigenous breeds project ibp under the all india coordinated research project aicrp on cattle for the conservation and genetic improvement of important indigenous cattle breeds of the country under the ibp initially hariana and ongole breeds of cattle were undertaken for improvement the genetic improvement of ongole cattle was initiated in collaboration with livestock research station at lam under shri venketeshwara veterinary university andhra pradesh from 1988 to march 2014 and 73 bulls were evaluated through field progeny testing fpt draft studies undertaken on ongole animals indicated that draught power of ongole varied from 060 to 072 hp genetic improvement of hariana cattle was initiated in collaboration with the ccs haryana agriculture university hisar 1989 to 2009 hariana bullocks had capacity to pull moderate load of 8 quintals for about 2 hours without any serious effect on the physiological status indian agriculture after independence 144since 2010 genetic improvements of gir kankrej and sahiwal breeds in their home tracts have been undertaken in ibp in collaboration with state agriculturalveterinary universities and icar institutes about 16500 gir 10500 kankrej and 3400 sahiwal cows from the farmersorganized herds have been covered under the project and 5490 2743 and 1003 improved female calves of respective breeds were produced the elite females had average lactation yield of 3238 3553 and 3393 kg in gir kankrej and sahiwal respectively showing overall improvements in respective breeds as 3673 2433 and 2002 during 2010 to 2020 in 2018 icarcirc established a herd of frieswal cow by selecting elite frieswal cows as bull mother farm for the production of young male calves for testing in the field progeny testing fpt programme at four different centres with coordinating unit at circ meerut the young bulls are reared at bull rearing unit at meerut for collection storage and distribution of semen the ranked bull semen was also used at the bull mother farm maintained at icarndri karnal for the production of young bulls the field progeny testing programme resulted in an increase of average first lactation 305 days milk yield of the frieswal progenies by 6776 in kv asu 4195 in gadv asu 1241 in baif and 3607 in gbpuat unit 42 buffalo network project on buffalo improvement npbi was started by icar in the year 1993 with icarcirb hisar as the coordinating unit the main aim of this project was to ensure the sustained maintenance of nucleus herds as bull mother units and production of improved germplasm on large scale for use in buffalo improvement program by establishing linkages with institutions important breeds of buffaloes viz murrah niliravi bhadawari jaffarabadi surti pandharpuri and godavari were included under npbi programme for their genetic improvement the elite herd of breedable murrah niliravi jaffarabadi bhadawari and surti buffaloes along with semen freezing laboratories were established under npbi for the production of genetically superior young bulls of these breeds high genetic merit male and female calves of murrah breed are being used for production of future elite parents at icarcirb hisar so far 19 sets of murrah bulls had been tested under the npbi the performance of the nucleus herd has increased from 1820 kglactation in 1993 to 2586 kg in 2020 42 increase a total of 33 progeny tested bulls have been produced under the project with highest genetic superiority of 1875 the project has achieved reduction in age at first calving in murrah buffalo

performance of bhadawari herd has increased from 1029 kg in 200304 to 1286 kg in 201920 25 increase in slmy 43 sheep an all india coordinated research programme aicrp on sheep breeding was launched by the icar in 1971 which was later converted to network project on sheep improvement and mega seed sheep project in 1990 with four farmbased units on four indigenous sheep breeds viz marwari muzzafarnagri deccani and nellore and two field units on madras red and magra sheep the growth traits since inception have remarkably improved to achieve body weight at 3 months which was earlier achieved at 6month of age and the weight which was earlier achieved at 12 months is now achieved at 6month age thus improving the mutton production and reducing the marketable age as also the cost of rearing improvements in survivability and reproductive performance have also yielded extra lambs thus yielding more mutton more return weight at birth was improved up to 28 25 to 33 kg at 6 months improved up to 86 malpura 140 vs 260 kg and at 12 months improved up to 65 19 kg to 32 kg in marwari sheep since inception 1975 vs 2020 the overall survivability 96 and lambing 88 have improved by 22 and 20 respectively since inception 44 goat all india coordinated research project aicrp on goat improvement in 1971 was started with the main objective of improving the performance of goat for milk meat and fiber pashmina production in different parts of the country crossbreeding and selective breeding approaches have been undertaken to improve the productivity performance of goats selective breeding approach was undertaken to improve the performance of indigenous breeds in their home tract this is being practiced at cirg makhdoom for increasing the milk production in jamunapari 63 and barbari goats 854 since 1985 selection for growth is continuing in barbari and jamunapari goats at cirg makhdoom since 1985 feedlot kids attained 3375101 kg and 4185081 kg at 9 and 12 months of age respectively in jamunapari goats there was increase in body weight at 12 months from 2032 kg to 2960 kg indicating an improvement of 4567 in barbari goats an increase in body weights from 1852 kg to 2444 kg at 12 months with improvement of 3196 over the years was observed the pashmina yield varies from 78 g in first clip to 227 g indian agriculture after independence 146in the third clip chegu and changthangi goats showed an annual pashmina production of 132 g and 214 g respectively with an average fiber diameter of 124 micron selection based on greasy fiber weight and fiber diameter combined into an index is likely to provide maximum genetic progress in improving pashmina production the genetic trends obtained for weight at all ages were positive in jamunapari goat 0144 kgyear at 9 months of age and 0199 kgyear at 12 months of age rout et al 2018 the genetic trend for birth weight was positive but almost constant in nature there was an increase in mean milk yield of 025 kgyear 070 kgyear and 072 kgyear at 90 days 140 days and total milk yield respectively in jamunapari goats rout et al 2017 barbari female jamunapari male 45 pig out of 906 million of pigs in the country livestock census 2019 a larger proportion 78 is indigenous and nondescript they are smaller in size well adapted to hot and humid climate and comparatively have better disease resistance an aicrp on pig was started during iv five year plan 19701971 initially with four centres that increased to 16 centres covering 7 indigenous pig breeds recently 6 centres of the megaseed project were also included in the aicrp at present there are ten registered pig breeds in the country ghungroo niang megha agonda goan tenyi v o nicobari doom zovawk gurrah mali and purnia presently conservation of these indigenous breeds is being done at the institute and aicrp centers by collecting superior truetothebreed animals from their breeding tract and further propagating through selective breeding litter size at birth and weaning showed continuous improvement over the years growth rates and body weights at 32weeks were also increased significantly litter size at weaning and weight at 8months also showed an overall genetic gain of 7 to 15 in different indigenous breeds however genetic improvement of indigenous breeds through pure breed selection has been slowachievements in livestock and poultry production in independent india 14746 poultry aicrp on poultry breeding started in 1971 initially has two components ie poultry for egg and poultry for meat later another component on rural poultry was added poultry for eggs had an objective to produce a strain cross layer with production target of 220 eggs hen housed in 500 days subsequently over the years the target was revised to 235 250 270 280 290 and 300 eggs in 500 days72 weeks of age with good egg size in the xi plan the target was revised with the objective to evolve high yielding strainsstrain crosses with average production performance of 305 eggs in 72 weeks hen housed and more than 52 g egg weight at 40 weeks of age the poultry strains developed under aicrp have achieved the targets of annual egg production of more than 300 eggs with athulya ilm 90 had average annual production of 315 egg and caripriya had an average of 301 eggs with better adaptability to tropical climate poultry for meat had initial target to produce a broiler weighing 1500 g at 10 weeks of age with an fcr of 125 which was later revised to 1200 g at 8 weeks of age in the xi plan the target was revised to evolve a commercial broiler with at least 1700 g body weight at 6 weeks or 2000 g at 7 weeks with feed efficiency of less than 20 and less than 5 mortality up to 5 weeks of age using conventional breeding the targets were achieved as the caribrodhanraja developed at icarcari attained 2100 g at 7 weeks with fcr of 17 the commercial cross ibl80 developed at gadv asu ludhiana erstwhile pau also attained 20 kg at 7 weeks 47 camel camel is a multipurpose animal as it can be used for milk meat wool transport race tourism agricultural work decoration for ceremonial functions and camel dance for amusement though camel numbers have decreased however retention of female population in higher numbers is likely due to rising interest of rearing camel for milk purpose icarnrc camel established on 20 th sept 1995 has taken an important initiative to establish camel milk as a human health adjuvant and camel as milch animal finally combined efforts of nrcc and other government and nongovernment organizations have resulted in devising an operational standard for camel milk in november 2016 by fssai and to recognise it in food category that promoted production and marketing of camel milk the lactational yield of four camel breeds viz bikaneri jaisalmeri kachchhi mewari were 122345 128466 180235 and 144235 kg respectively the lactation length in corresponding breeds were 33818 36718 43567 and 36771 days the daily milk production average is estimated to be between 310 l during a lactation period of 1218 months the yield could increase to 20 l per day under improved feed husbandry practice water availability and veterinary care several valueadded camel milk products have been developed to promote consumption of camel milk and milkproducts annual fiber yield from an adult camel amounts to 840 g and its blending products with sheep wool have good market value a model for camel ecotourism has been developed at nrcc for promoting the camelindian agriculture after independence 14848 yak yaks play multidimensional socioculturaleconomic role for the pastoral nomads who rear yaks in high altitude himalayan ranges mainly for earning their nutritional and livelihood security icarnrc on yak established in 1989 works for conservation and improvement of yak for higher productivity and profitability in the country the only breed of yak in india ie arunachali was registered in 2018 the institute has developed nrc on yak has the privilege to produce first et calf of yak named mismo which was born on 27th june 2005 and later first yak calf born through opuivf on 27th july 2017 was named norgyal complete feed block area specific mineral mixture and ai technology with frozen semen average conception rate 65 for sustained yak production and rapid multiplication of superior germplasm the first yak calf through ai was born on 7th july 2006 in the institute selection of superior yak bulls and their maximization through ai technology is being practiced this technology has been propagated and frozen yak semen straws are regularly distributed to ah departments of yak rearing states for genetic improvement and reduce inbreeding the protocol for production of embryo through invitro fertilization ivf of octytes retrieved with ultrasound guided ovum pickup opu technique in yak is a significant development towards conservation and multiplication of elite yak germplasm in the country the protocol for induction and synchronization of oestrus in yak ovsynch protocol was developed fiftyone varieties of fodder species received from fao were tested at different altitude and seed setting was found reasonable for dactylis vicia and agrostis spp three varieties of salix were found to be suitable in this region number of products from yak milk viz yak milk whey beverages cheese functional paneer flavoured churkam yak mozzarella etc and carpetswall hangings foot mats jackets and other garments have been developed at the institute 49 mithun mithun bos frontalis or gayal is a unique bovine species playing central role in improving livelihoods of indigenous tribes of neh region and symbol of prestige for local tribes it is the state animal of arunachal pradesh and nagaland icarnational research centre nrc on mithun located at medziphema nagaland is the only institute in the world fully dedicated to rd and extension on this rare bovine it is phylogenetically distinct from other bos species however based on phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genome of mithun it has been found that gaur and mithun have common origin from an extinct bos species icar nrc on mithun has sequenced the genome 300 gb and annotated it for evolutionary and genetic studies first ett calf named bharat was born on 27th march 2012 and second calf prithvi on 11th may 2012 the first calf mohan was born from cryopreserved embryo on 12th may 2012achievements in livestock and poultry production in independent india 149traditionally mithun is being reared under a freerange forestbased ecosystem with almost zero input but having great liking for salt feeding mithun is mainly reared for meat purposes and often slaughtered for highquality organic meat during marriage ceremonies religious festivals etc therefore popularly called as ceremonial cattle being low in fat mithun meat is good for human health the ideal age of slaughter is 45 years with dressing as 5862 mithun can produce 115 kgday of milk which is rich in fat 813 solidsnotfat 1824 and protein 57 mithun milk has higher unsaturated fatty acids amino acids vitamin a d and e minerals ca and mg and lactoferrin compared to cattle and buffalo milk based on the calorific value 1 kg of mithun milk is equal to 2 kg of cow milk the institute developed areaspecific mineral mixture lowcost complete feed block and designed a salt dispenser for mithun the ai technology and estrus synchronization protocol were developed multiplying superior germplasm valueadded products from mithun milk were developed 5 interventions for improving livestock and poultry 51 molecular and biotechnological interventions large volume of information has been generated on molecular genetic studies in

nutritional interventions in livestock production system feeds being the major input cost 70 needs special attention and necessitates to manage the feed resources efficiently to sustain the present growth rate the rd in the area of animal nutritional and feed technology also occupy the central place in the journey towards science led increase in animal production in independent india with the growing demand for milk meat and animal products the country is facing a shortage of 133 317 and 275 of dry fodder green fodder and concentrate respectively grasses from pastures forest areas and wastelands fallow lands are the major sources of natural vegetation available for livestock feeding there are four major types of grasslands in india viz arid semiarid submountainous and temperate regions estimates of feed availability indicate that availability of feed resources in terms of dry fodder green fodder and concentrates are 435 920 and 57 million tons respectively fodder crops are the plant species that are cultivated and harvested for feeding the animals in the form of forage cut green and fed fresh silage preserved under anaerobic condition and hay dehydrated green fodder the estimated potential availability of fodder on the basis of dm cp and me is 11595 14817 and 1058 million tons respectively the crop residues like straws stovers sugarcane tops tubers and roots are the major feed resources for feeding of the indian livestock across all ecosystems at national level of the total 71857 million tons of dry matter available crop residues account for 6438 oil cakes and meals obtained as byproduct after extraction of oil from oil seeds are valuable source of protein for livestock feeding major oil seed crops grown in india ie groundnut rape and mustard soybean sesame safflower sunflower castor linseed and niger utilized for feeding of livestock substantial quantities of about 45 million tons of unconventional cakes from castor seed karanj seed neem seed jatropa seed rubber seed etc are also potentially available fruits and vegetables wastes constitute another important animal feed resource but due to high moisture 8090 high soluble sugars 664 and crude

of pbmcs of two indigenous breeds ie kadai adu and kodi adu female goats of oneyear age under heat stress for a period of 45 days clearly demonstrated the distinct transcriptomic signature for imparting thermotolerance in both kanni adu and kodi adu breeds in addition the study clearly demonstrated that hsf1 hsp70 ghr thra fshr prlr tlr5 and il18 genes could serve as ideal biomarkers for reflecting the climate resilient potential of indigenous goat breeds the epigenetic alterations due to heat stress in nandidurga and bidri goats revealed less epigenetic methylation changes in nandidurga breed as compared to bidri breed a simulated heat stress model for using in climate chambers to induce heat stress to simulate the natural heat stress was developed to study the influence of heat stress on various goat breeds the climatograph of the breed origin was developed and accordingly thirty years cardinal weather data are programmed to develop this simulated heat stress model the model was designed in such a way to induce heat stress as experienced by the breeds during grazing condition in their natural location the average thirty years data of temperature and relative humidity of summer season marchapril was programmed at hourly interval from 1000 h to 1600 h to depict the natural heat stress experienced by the grazing animals therefore the simulated heat stress model could be of practical relevance as it simulates the natural climatic condition further from ethical point of view also the simulated heat stress model offers better scope to study heat stress impact in farm animals sejian et al 2019 indian agriculture after independence 16483 poultry heat stress causes serious losses in poultry production because it increases mortality and reduces performance of poultry several nutritional and managemental practices could not completely prevent the negative effect of heat stress introgressing some important major genes like naked neck na and frizzle f into broiler germplasm may substantially improve the heat tolerance commercial broiler chickens exposed to cold stress without brooding during first week of life during winter season resulted in poor performance the performance of broiler chicken was hampered due to heat stress whenever the thi exceeded the value of 750 the production performance of laying hens maintained at 29 0c with thi of 8247 in environmentcontrolled house facility performed better when compared to conventional poultry house the use of water foggers for spraying water as fine droplets in open sided poultry house during summer season reduced the thi by 22 units with reduced egg breakage under semiarid conditions performance and egg shell quality of egg laying chicken can be maintained during summer season by supplementing fiber hydrolyzing enzymes in diet the three indigenously developed broilers viz caribrotropicana naked neck and frizzle plumaged caribromritunjai naked neck plumaged and caribrovishal normal plumaged exposed to three different this ie 72 85 and 91 for 4 hours daily for 7 days exhibited that production traits declined whereas water consumption increased at higher this respiration rate body temperature increased at higher this glucose and acth levels increased whereas na and k declined at higher this heterophil content and hl ratio increased whereas lymphocytes content declined at higher this the mrna expression analysis of hsp70 in liver revealed higher expression levels at later days during the exposure trials indicated the phenomenon of stress memory and acquired thermotolerance among the three genetic groups caribromritunjai exhibited highest averages for production traits as well as tolerated heat stress in a better way 84 preconditioning and epigenetic thermal adaptation in poultry epigenetic temperature adaptation is based on the assumption that environmental factors especially ambient temperature has a strong influence on the determination of set point for physiological control systems during critical developmental phases of embryonic development thermal regulation is regulated by alteration in cellular properties in frontal hypothalamus and this pathway is activated by brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf these alterations may be modulated by the epigenetic code that determines the repertoire of transcribed proteins during 1014 days of incubation a higher temperature 40c cycle of 4 h daily were given and the thermally preconditioned chick were exposed to thi 91 for 7 days at the age of 10 days thermally conditioned chicks exhibited better performance in terms of body weights weight gains feed intake and fcr as compared to control group on reexposure to thi 91 bdnf gene expression in brain exhibited higher expression levels in thermally conditioned chicks as compared to control group approximately 2fold increase in dna methylation was exhibited by thermally conditioned chicks in bdnf achievements in livestock and poultry production in independent india 165gene promoter over the control group chicks overall the thermally conditioned chicks exhibited better performance icardpr has developed a customized electrolyte mixture containing potassium chloride 400 sodium citrate 75 sodium dihydrogen phosphate 20 disodium hydrogen phosphate 20 and sodium bicarbonate 485 for supplementation through the broiler feed the recommended dose is 10 kg t 1 of feed and the cost of electrolyte mixture is rs 45 kg1 dietary supplementation of ashwagandha extract 075 turmeric extract 01 and amla powder 10 betain hydrochloride 02 chromium 03 ppm improved the performance of birds by alleviating heat stress during summer season 9 way forward the conventional approaches have tremendously helped in augmenting animal production however several challenges are being faced viz the animal populations are reaching to a state of genetic plateau resulting into lowered genetic gains cost of feed and other resources are escalating due to various reasons the increasing ambient temperature and weather changing patterns are resulting into stress causing various physiological and reproductive disorders and the changing market formats and dynamic state of public likings necessitates for diversification and innovation in animal food products and value addition this scenario dictates the need for discovering inventing advanced tools and technologies and applying them for improving production and health of livestock species the advanced tools such snp chip based genomic selection is expected to increase efficiency of selection and augment the gains the biotechnological approaches like gene editing rnai transgenesis etc may help in augmenting the production and quality of products even beyond the physiological barriers the artificial intelligencebased precision livestock farming for different species is expected to be the future of livestock farming the arts such as ett opuivfivep semen sexing and animal cloning will be improvised for easier and economic application at the field level the feed technologies and innovations for improving fcr and alternate feed resources for cheaper feed formulation is an important researchable area the diversification in products technology and value addition along with traceabilitybased quality assurance would help in meeting the market demands the advancements in different areas may be converged with the conventional tools or the different advanced tools may be applied simultaneously as technology package for bringing improvement in quality and quantity of animal produce and products 10 conclusion livestock sector has made phenomenal growth during the last eight decades with manyfold increase in production and productivity of livestock species bringing india towards self reliance in animal products as well increasing export potential of this sector the concerted and interwoven rd efforts across different disciplines of animal science have culminated into development of several innovative technologies and products which have transformed the animal sector into industry such as dairy industry poultry industry feed industry food indian agriculture after independence 166processing and value addition industry etc the advanced tools and technologies are being used in different areas like animal production health reproduction housing and management livestock products development efforts are continuing for improving the performance of livestock and poultry through genetic and or biotechnological interventions improved housing and nutritional interventions are helping in economic production with better animal welfare the advanced reproductive technologies have tremendous potential in the faster multiplication of the superior germplasm as well as in the conservation of threatened breedsspecies overall the rd in animal science is striving for narrowing the gap between demand and availability with regards to animal products to alleviate the problems of malnutrition thereby making country selfreliant besides expanding export potential in this sector references aicrp

marine and inland water resources that support diverse aquatic ecosystems possesses enormous potential to harness its fisheries and aquaculture to support the income nutritional and livelihood security of its population following independence there has been a strong commitment within the political and scientific community to pursue the above objectives through a sciencecentric strategy strong emphasis was placed on developing institutions and infrastructure that support scientific fishing and fish farming in the form of systematic surveys and exploratory investigations the initial goal was to characterize and document the countrys fishery resources the zoological survey of india founded in 1916 was instrumental in this process by conducting extensive research on fish taxonomy and descriptive natural history numerous initiatives for the discovery and distribution of fish stocks were conducted emphasizing the importance of scientific stock management recognizing the importance of trained manpower and the need for the sustained scientific pursuit to bring about a significant transformation in the fisheries sector in 1947 two fisheries research stations the central marine fisheries station later renamed as central marine fisheries research institute and the inland fisheries research station later renamed as central inland fisheries research institute were established these institutions set the groundwork for the countrys strong fisheries research base which has since grown into a panindia network of research extension and teaching in the subsequent decades the primary focus was to develop expertise in fish stock assessment fish biology modernization of fishing craft and gear standardization of aquaculture protocols for marine and inland fishes disease diagnostics and management fishery habitat monitoring and environment management postharvest value addition market development strategies and so on to cater to the need for trained manpower in the research institutes the central institute of fisheries education cife was established in 1961 along with forming several achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 169fisheries colleges in statecentral agricultural universities over an extended period central institute of fisheries technology cift established in 1957 focused its research efforts on the development of harvest and postharvest technology thereby enabling the country to meet the growing needs of the seafood industry the major challenges in fish farming were systematically addressed and several breakthroughs in breeding and hatchery development of major finfishes and shellfishes were achieved during the first three decades after independence the success of induced breeding of carps by hypophysation in 1957 and largescale farming of indian major carps in the 1980s revolutionized carp farming in the country the research focus on aquaculture was intensified with the establishment of independent institutes central institute of freshwater aquaculture cifa central institute of brackishwater aquaculture ciba and nrc on coldwater fisheries nrccwf in 1987 by reorganizing the research centers of cifri these institutes not only strengthened existing aquaculture technologies but also developed cuttingedge technologies in the aspects of species diversification strain improvement diagnostic tools and control of aquatic diseases modernization of aquaculture systems feed for cultured species and other intensive farming systems shrimp farming witnessed unprecedented development during the 1990s owing to the renewed research and extension focus indias fish and fish products exports soared at unprecedented rates during the mid1990s making the country a major contributor to the global seafood industry however the issues of disease incidence started dampening the growth momentum of the sector during the early 2000s to address these issues harnessing the advancements in genetics and biotechnology were mooted the national bureau of fish genetic resources nbfgr established in 1983 has played a notable role in the above context apart from its mandated areas of characterizing and cataloging the diverse genetic resources for sustainable utilization and species diversification new tools of biotechnology and genetics were developed which were utilized for stock characterization and maneuvering suitable genetic traits for fish improvement the demand from the field also catalyzed significant advancements in developing cell lines vaccine development cryopreservation of fish gametes genomics biofertilization bioprospecting surrogate fish development genetic engineering and transgenics among other areas concerted efforts made by the fishery science fraternity spread across the nares contributed to doubledigit growth of the fisheries sector in the last few decades and currently contributing to 728 of the agricultural gdp in the national economy india presently holds the distinction of being the 2 nd largest aquaculture producer and 4th largest capture fishery producer in the world continued growth in fish demand has necessitated many more scientific advances from across the fisheries sector several challenges such as depleting water resources degraded habitats pollution of water bodies from landbased sources climate change the spread of alien species ocean acidification excessive culture as well as fishing pressure the emergence of new aquatic diseases antibiotic resistance in the culture systems etc need focused attention in the future years research breakthroughs achieved in the areas of captive breeding and mass production of highvalue marine fish species along with advancements in cage farming technology necessitate further indian agriculture after independence 170advancements in the fields of precision mariculture and artificial intelligence so that greater input use efficiency and automation can be achieved further there is a need to harness the potential opportunities in the areas of species diversification and value addition high levels of wastage as well as inefficiencies pervading the fish value chains need to be tackled through innovative technological and logistic interventions to address this and to meet the future needs of entrepreneurship development and the overall sector development effective mechanisms for technology extension must be put in place therefore new perspectives for inclusive and sustainable growth as well as the scientific impetus in the fields of fisheries research and climatesmart development are being emphasized 1 introduction fisheries and aquaculture are fastgrowing sectors of indias economy that support the nutritional and livelihood security of millions of dependent populations during 201819 the fisheries sector contributed as much as rs 2129 billion to the national gross value added gv a which accounted for 728 of the gv a of agricultural and allied sectors and 124 of the total gv a in the triennium ending 201819 estimates show that the sector grew at a rate close to 11 over the last decade surpassing most other subsectors of agriculture seven decades of indian independence have witnessed the transformation of indias fisheries sector from one based mostly on capture to one in which aquaculture contributes twothirds even though fishing and aquaculture are ageold activities intensive development of the sector in india was driven by wellplanned research development programmes particularly after independence these programmes are mostly aimed at fostering investments and technological innovations bridging legislative and policy inadequacies and promoting local support systems that facilitate efficient harvestingproduction value chain development and marketing activities india presently holds the distinction of being the 4 th largest producer in capture fisheries and 2nd largest producer in aquaculture in the world indias total fish production during 201920 stands at 1416 million tons mt which is about 76 of total global fish production fig 1 fish and fish products also earn considerable foreign exchange for the country worth over ud 673 billion during the early few decades after independence marine fisheries received a considerable focus in terms of capital and infrastructure development about 70 of total fish production during the 1950s was of marine origin subsequently growth in marine fish landings was brought about through mechanization of fishing and intensification in efforts through multiday trips aided by advanced navigation scouting and fishfinding techniques this led to a steady improvement in marine fish landings that rose from about 05 mt to a peak of 39 mt in 2012 aquaculture picked up momentum during the 1970s with carp farming in freshwater and late 1980s with advances in shrimp farming gradually enhancing its relative share in total fish production india presently produces about 9 mt through aquaculture which is about twothirds of the total fish production with 67 average annual growth in the last three decades freshwater aquaculture is sharing about 90 of achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 171total aquaculture production brackishwater aquaculture was reliant mostly on black tiger shrimp penaeus monodon during the 1990s 2000s but was subsequently shifted to the introduced species whiteleg shrimp litopenaeus vannamei mariculture is another promising segment touted to have considerable future potential in the wake of successful demonstration of cage culture all along the coasts of the country during the last decade fig 1 trends in fish production in india during the postindependence period much of the above achievements were catalyzed by sustained research and extension efforts coordinated through the research institutes and universities under the national agricultural research and education system nares the indian council of agricultural research icar with its eight fisheries research institutes has played a significant role in bringing about a noteworthy transformation that altered the lives of millions of fishers fish farmers and other stakeholders across the value chain this chapter attempts to document the key milestones as well as the major scientific achievements that aided in this transformation 2 milestones in fisheries and aquaculture postindependence fisheries research in india during its initial years focused on the biology of commercially important species including age and growth food and feeding reproduction migration ecosystem productivity biodiversity estimation of fishing efforts and landings and fisheriesrelated environmental studies silas 2003 these studies included both marine and freshwater fishes from diverse openwater systems the focus shifted from hydrobiology to ecosystem dynamics primary productivity preypredator interactions and so on adaptation and mitigation of climate change pollution of water bodies bioassay bioremediation and other aspects have also received much thoughtfulness innovations in harvesting and postharvest technologies increased the efficiency of capture fisheries operations greatly in postindependent india the most significant technological advances that have aided the evolution of fish harvest and postharvest technology are i advancements in craft designs mechanization of propulsion gear operations and handling of fish catch ii use of synthetic components for fishing gear iii satellitebased remote sensing techniques and innovations in acoustic fish detection iv advancements indian agriculture after independence 172in navigation v development of preservation and processing techniques for fish and vi development of quality and safety standards ayyappan et al 2011 in 1957 the breakthrough in induced breeding of carp garnered significant attention in aquaculture research researchers succeeded in standardizing breeding protocols massscale seed production techniques and nursery rearing and fingerling production protocols for prioritized cultivable species resulting in increased yields ayyappan and jena 2001 following this silver carp and grass carp were introduced with a polyculture protocol developed later with indian major carps continuing efforts in this direction led to the development of breeding and seed production technologies for other species such as catfishes minor carps murrels freshwater prawns and other species in parallel efforts were also made to develop improved fish strain through selective breeding nutrient management and disease management initiation of the all india coordinated research projects aicrps by the icar viz composite carp culture and brackishwater fish farming in the 1970s helped in validation and refinement of the packages of practices of scientific carp polyculture and farming of brackishwater species including shrimps hatchery seed production of black tiger shrimp and indian white shrimp penaeus indicus and the development of semiintensive farming technologies were prioritized areas that received utmost attention the introduction of exotic l vannamei in 2009 and its successful adoption in the subsequent years was made possible through concerted efforts towards environmental impact assessment studies development of quarantine measures biosecurity at the farmhatchery level adoption of better management practices bmps sustainable intensification protocols etc the introduction of improved culture methods paved way for research on the productivity and efficiency of culture systems recent breakthroughs in captive breeding seed production and growout technologies of marine and brackishwater fishes such as cobia pompano seabass grouper milkfish grey mullet pearl spot etc are expected to accelerate the growth of diversified brackishwater farming and mariculture in the coming years efforts are also directed towards the standardization of fattening protocols for crabs and the culture of mussels oysters seaweeds etc in recent years several frontier areas of research have garnered considerable attention from the scientific community including genetic engineering cell line development genomics stemcell culture cryopreservation of fish gametes vaccines biofertilization bioprospecting etc ayyappan et al 2015 additionally emphasis is placed on postharvest value addition to develop methods for preserving the quality of fish and fish products numerous industrial products were developed from lowvalued fishes or other fishery byproducts significant effort was also devoted to the advancement of packing technology and the enhancement of processing machinery as with biological and frontier science research socioeconomic and extension research has played a vital role in recent years in changing the fisheries sector some of the thrust areas in this realm include socioeconomic evaluation of capture and culture systems and their efficiency studies impact assessment of technologies market and trade research value chain studies gender research fisheries policy and legislation information and communication etc achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 17321 achievements in capture fisheries 211 marine fisheries indias marine fisheries was of subsistence nature during the early 1950s producing about 05 mt annually which however achieved remarkable development during the last six decades the establishment of the marine fisheries research station presently icar central marine fisheries research institute or icarcmfri on 3rd february 1947 at madras university tamil nadu which later shifted to mandapam camp tamil nadu in 1949 was a significant step forward by the government of india the current annual production of about 38 mt a 75 times increase in the last seven decades is a testimony of the development made by the sector supported by a coastline of 8118 kilometers an exclusive economic zone eez of 202 million km 2 and a continental shelf area of 053 million sq km the present catch level constitutes about 716 of the revalidated fishery potential of 531 mt comprising 492 mt from 0200 m depth 0097 mt from 200500 m depth 017 mt of oceanic resources and 012 mt from andaman nicobar and lakshadweep island ecosystems research efforts in the areas of exploratory surveys mapping for productive fishing grounds and virgin areas biology of commercially important species stock monitoring judicious exploitation and conservation environmental assessments and mechanization of crafts and gears besides infrastructure developments over the years have contributed to the growth in the sector the artisanal sector contributed to most of the fish landings up to the sixties subsequent growth in mechanized fishing along with the motorization of artisanal crafts led to the drastic decline in the share of the artisanal sector in fish landings presently the mechanized sector accounts for 83 motorized 16 and the artisanal sector only 1 of total marine fish catch the growth in marine fisheries resulted in significant increases in production employment generation and domestic and export earnings 2111 developments and adoption of harvest technologies mechanization of fishing craft in india occurred in four stages beginning with the motorization of some conventional designs of traditional crafts progressing to the introduction of more specialized motorized crafts and finally to the establishment of a fullfledged fishing fleet since 1953 attempts were made to motorize many traditional vessels prevalent locally like the lodhia machuwa kotia and satpativersova type vessels zeiner et al 1958 the indonorwegian project established in 1953 at kollam kerala with the objective of modernization of fisheries and allied activities and later operational from cochin made a significant impact on the overall fisheries development of the country in 1962 the project introduced 25 feet boat with 16 hp diesel engines that could use as a small shrimp trawl the project had also introduced vessels of different length classes and suitable gears to operate from these vessels the central fisheries technology research station established at cochin in 1957 which was later renamed as central institute of fisheries technology cift contributed indian agriculture after independence 174significantly to the harvest and postharvest sectors of fisheries by developing vessel designs in association with naval architects from fao and designing and optimizing different gear designs the institute played a major role in developing the postharvest sector in which the major achievements were the development and optimization of freezing techniques for export and the development of quality standards for the export items faoundpsupported pelagic fisheries project operated in two phases during 19711975 and 197679 also contributed significantly to the fisheries development the marine products export development authority mpeda established in 1972 under the ministry of commerce government of india has been promoting the export of fishery products from the country faos bay of bengal programme in the 1980s built fiberglass beach landing crafts for use off the surfbeaten shores of tamil nadu and andhra pradesh the icarcift in collaboration with naval experts from the fao introduced twelve standard designs of wooden fishing boats ranging in size from 767 to 1524 meters for various types of fishing operations providing a significant boost to indias fisheries mechanization programme more than 80 of the motorized wooden fishing crafts of indias fishing fleet are said to be based on the popular cift design or its later derivatives the institute has also developed newer designs of trawl gear with improved selectivity and reduced negative environmental impacts to protect the biodiversity and environment and ensure the longterm sustainability of fishery resources the trawl net gained substantial adoption among the fishers of all coastal states and presently is the most important gear in marine waters contributing more than 50 of the catches from the indian waters the harvest of prawns and shrimps from deep waters witnessed a notable jump through trawl fishing that targeted demersal fishes and midwater pelagic fishes fig 2 fv sagar harita at deep sea the generation of bycatch from lowselectivity fishing gears has been a matter of concern in commercial fishing this is particularly of concern in trawl nets and proved to be destructive in terms of juvenile catches the bycatch reduction devices brd developed achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 175by icarcift have been able to address this problem square mesh codends fisheye brd sieve net brd juvenile fish excluder cum shrimp sorting device jfessd etc are some of the brds that were fieldtested for their effectiveness several state governments have stipulated the use of square mesh cod ends in trawl nets to check the incidence of juvenile catches species that are at risk due to climateinduced changes such as sea turtles and other endangered threatened and protected etp species often form a bycatch in different gear systems like trawls and long lines field studies indicated that the use of turtle excluder devices teds helps release turtles getting in the way of trawl nets and circle hooks thereby resulting in lower mortality rates the use of pingers acts as a deterrent to cetacean species and results in their interaction with fishing gear like seine nets icarcift has carried out extensive research to improve the fuel efficiency of fishing vessels and in 2016 developed a 1975 m energyefficient combination of deepsea fishing vessels with approximately 9 fuelsaving features which is now accepted as a standard design for indias efforts towards improving harvest from relatively less exploited deepsea resources in the indian eez reducing the trawling efforts and emissions and better catch quality are other collateral gains of this innovative design 2112 marine fish landing estimation and fish stock assessment new fishing crafts and gears technology led to a substantial increase in landings of various resources pushing the research initiatives on the estimation of resourcewise marine fish landings to develop a statistically sound database on catch and effort that can aid in stock assessment exercises pilot studies were conducted by icarcmfri resulting in the development of multistage stratified random sampling msrs design for building up a timeseries database on gearwise specieswise and seasonwise marine fish production of the country during the early 1950s to 1970s a timeseries database was generated including gearwise seasonal and spatial fish catch data for major commercial resources this was supplemented with realtime fishery surveys conducted by the fishery survey of india fsi this sampling scheme is still in use for collecting marine fish landings data making it probably the longestrunning sampling scheme in marine fisheries at least among developing nations initial forays into stock assessment began with the estimation of growth and mortality parameters of indian oil sardine and indian mackerel during the 1960s the first group of fish stock assessments included stock assessments of 14 species comprising fish shrimp and cephalopods following this stock assessments of over 40 commercially important resources of the indian eez were carried out applying lengthbased methods in the most recent round of stock assessments 67 stocks of marine finfish and shellfish were assessed and it was found that 86 were being fished within biologically sustainable levels ie yields from these stocks are yet to attain maximum sustainable yield msy in addition to traditional lengthbased single species stock assessment models icarcmfri has also moved into assessments using multispecies models biomass dynamics models and ecosystembased models indian agriculture after independence 176table 1 milestones in marine capture fisheries research year milestone 1948 first attempt towards scientific

stocks of marine finfish and shellfish was carried out 212 inland fisheries the establishment of the central inland fisheries research station on 17th march 1947 at barrackpore west bengal which was elevated to a fullfledged institute in 1959 the central inland fisheries research institute cifri was a testament to the rd thrust given by the government of india for the development of openwater fisheries even before the independence of the country the countrys inland water resources include 29000 kilometers of rivers 03 million hectares mha of estuaries 019 mha of backwaters and lagoons 35 mha of reservoirs 05 mha of floodplain wetlands and 072 mha of upland lakes which annually contribute approximately 13 mt of fish 2121 riverine and estuarine fisheries indias river systems consist of 14 large rivers 44 medium rivers and an infinite number of tiny rivers and desert streams studies have shown that the fish production of these riverine systems varies from 064 to 164 tons per km with an average of 1 t km 1 with a combined length of 12500 kms and a drainage area of 1060000 km2 the river ganga and its tributaries have garnered considerable attention from scholars since the independence of the country over the years the construction of barrages in the majority of its tributaries has resulted in flow diversion resulting in decreased fish capture and species variety loss achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 177payne et al 2004 in general indian major carp followed by catfish murrels and other miscellaneous species contribute to fish catches in major riverine systems except peninsular rivers where endemic species predominate extensive research has been conducted to highlight critical variables like overfishing habitat damage pollution sedimentation and water abstraction that have contributed to the catch declines over the years while the introduction of nonselective gear with a reduced mesh size has slowed the recruitment of important commercial species damaging fishing techniques such as dynamiting and poisoning pose hazards to biodiversity cifris spawn prospecting experiments in the 1960s resulted in the formulation of a system for riverine spawn gathering and site selection the efficiency of shooting nets in collecting spawn in the shallow margins of flooded rivers aided in the exploitation of major carp seed resources from major riverine systems the icarcifri has recently reestimated the production potential of selected stretches of ganga to address the declining trend of fish production measures like ranching habitat characterization and protection fishing ban and application of gis and remote sensing technology for resource mapping are suggested to understand the dynamics of river hydrology and ecology since 2010 icarcifri has studied the environmental flow of several indian rivers such as teesta cauvery mahanadi and kathojodi river ranching has been undertaken in different rivers by varied organizations from time to time as an important strategy for sustaining the fisheries of commerciallyimportant species since 2016 icarcifri has been carrying out a massive ranching programme with the release of over 45 million advanced fingerlings of indian major carps in depleted stretches of the river ganga covering states like uttarakhand uttar pradesh bihar jharkhand west bengal with the funding support of the national mission for clean ganga nmcg the diverse estuary systems covering about 300000 ha also provide a sizable portion of indias fisheries resources the hooghlymatlah estuary the largest estuary system in the country captures approximately 66200 tons of fish year 1 along a 296kilometer stretch 2122 fisheries enhancement in reservoirs and wetlands the average annual fish yield of small medium and large reservoirs was 499 123 and 114 kg ha 1 yr1 respectively as against the potential yield of 100 75 and 50 kg ha1 yr1 sugunan 1995 considering such immense potential the government of india had initiated schemes for reservoir fisheries development through fingerling stocking programmes with technological backstopping from icarcifri with such interventions the fish yield from indian reservoirs in recent years increased to 190 98 and 34 kg ha1 yr1 against a reassessed potential of 500 200 and 100 kg ha1 yr1 from small medium and large reservoirs respectively of late the adoption of cage culture technology was proved to be a viable option to harness the potential of such resources while the pangas catfish pangasianodon hypophthalmus has been the species of choice for cage culture across the country due to its higher growth and production potential other diversified species are being evaluated for a higher return yield levels of 2530 tons of pangas are achieved in cages of 6 m x 4 m x 4 m in a 68 months culture period icarcifri has recommended the adoption of cage culture mainly in medium and large reservoirs accounting for about indian agriculture after independence 178167 million ha and thereby showing the availability of at least 1500 ha of water area for installation cages by taking only 01 of the available water area surveys in chhattisgarh maharashtra gujarat odisha and jharkhand showed that an entrepreneurfisherman could earn a net return of rs 60000150000 cage1 year1 the cage culture technology has been further refined and diversified with gi model cage for better adoption and profitability at present there are about 20000 floating cages in place producing over 50000 tons of fish and generating employment of 08 million mandays year1 the technology has paved new avenues for entrepreneurship development due to high production and profitability wetlands or beels are among the most productive resources offering multiple ecosystem goods and services the fish yield realized from floodplain wetlands was low between 50200 kg ha 1 yr1 during 19902000 due to a lack of scientific management guidelines with the intervention of icarcifri culturebased fisheries were adopted in various wetlands which resulted in increasing the fish yield to 200400 kg ha1 yr1 in the eastern and northeastern regions the adoption of ecosystembased integrated wetland fisheries management and the funding support from the national fisheries development board nfdb has resulted in further improvement in fish production and an average fish yield of 400800 kg ha 1 yr1 was realized during 201020 recently icarcifri has also commercialized cifri hdpe pen and developed policy guidelines for sustainable wetland fisheries management table

rich ichthyofaunal diversity of which the majority are food fishes while others have potential ornamental and sports value the achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 179commercially important indigenous species are mahseers and snow trout the common exotic coldwater sport and food fishes include trouts brown trout salmo trutta fario rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss and common carp research in coldwater fisheries in india began only in the 1960s fish production from the coldwaters falls short of expectations for a variety of reasons viz low productivity of upland waters slow growth rate of fish species and the low fecundity of fish species icardirectorate of coldwater fisheries research dcfr has developed and standardized the breeding protocol of several indigenous food and ornamental fishes and disseminated the same to the farmers for employment generation through smallscale entrepreneurship gisbased resource mapping the development of locationspecific water conservation models for fish culture genetic improvement programmes for commercially important species and the development of thermal tolerance strains etc are a few areas being investigated to improve catches from coldwater fisheries sport fisheries being a vital activity in upland states enhancing trout and mahseer population in hill streams and lakes through effective resource management and ranching programmes are of paramount importance 214 climate change and fisheries management strategies extensive studies have been conducted to assess the impact of climate change on marine fisheries and the development of management strategies especially through the project on national innovations in climate resilient agriculture nicra operated by icar for the last one decade vulnerability maps have been prepared for coastal villages in eight districts in maritime states and developed integrated district level adaptation and mitigation idlam plans the study following life cycle analysis lca showed that the carbon footprint for wildcaught marine fish in india is 175 lower than the global average using the climate changefish biomass model the annual catch of indian oil sardine was forecasted these studies helped in developing management strategies and mapping of distributional shifts for 68 commercially important marine species based on the vulnerability assessment further an adaptation framework based on the alternation in the distribution and abundance of 14 selected marine species due to changes in phenology diet and reproductive pattern impacted by increasing sea surface temperature sst was also developed citizen science networks and climate clubs were created to generate climaterelated information based on opportunities for awareness as well as data generation in sensitive ecosystems including marshy wetlands the ecosystem of the ganga river has experienced atmospheric temperature rising thus resulting in abnormalities of the heat budget of the riverine ecosystems natural recruitment of indian major carps in the ganga river system has been largely affected resulting in a decline in fish spawning due to the impact of climate change a considerable decline in fish seed availability has been noticed from 788 in the 1960s to 345 in 2004 vass et al 2009 a digital elevation model generated for the coastal district of south 24 parganas indicated the potential for 311 submergence of aquaculture areas in response to sea water incursions indian agriculture after independence 18022 developments in aquaculture 221 freshwater aquaculture fish rearing was a traditional activity in indias freshwater impoundments which were largely restricted in the eastern states with the establishment of fisheries departments in certain states in the early twentieth century attempts were made to initiate the fish culture practices however fish farming by then was based on the riverine seed collection and lacked basic scientific principles efforts to understand the reproductive physiology of major freshwater fishes yielded fruits only after independence during the postindependence period the research thrust was focused on fundamental studies aiming at artificial fish propagation the introduction of exotic fastgrowing species and the popularization of fish production technology through widespread demonstrations of fish farming the icar cifri through its pond culture division established at cuttack in 1949 its subsequent upgradation to the freshwater aquaculture research and training centre fartc at kausalyaganga bhubaneswar in 1976 and further elevation of fartc to an independent institute in 1987 the icarcentral institute of freshwater aquaculture cifa truly led the freshwater aquaculture research in the country modern aquaculture research has been focused on three indian major carps the introduction of exotic species with faster growth rates viz grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix and common carp cyprinus carpio into the carp polyculture system was one of the first steps taken during postindependence to increase fish productivity in ponds several new species were brought into the culture system to increase productivity and farm income silver barb puntius gonionotus african catfish clarias gariepinus striped catfish pangasianodon hypophthalmus tilapia oreochromis niloticus and redbellied pacu piaractus brachypomus are a few some of them however were illegally introduced with required environmental impact assessment studies and formulation of guidelines striped catfish was later approved for farming in different culture systems such species have gained widespread acceptance and contribute significantly to aquaculture production in 2009 the government of india permitted rajiv gandhi centre for aquaculture rgca and three other farmers groups for seed production and farming of gift genetically improved farmed tilapia tilapia and as per the suggestions of the national committee on introduction of exotic aquatic species guidelines were also developed for commercial farming of tilapia 2211 breeding and hatchery development of finfishes and freshwater prawn the collection of seed from the rivers was the only source of seed supply until the 1950s in the country the technology of bundh breeding in the 1960s which become popular in west bengal and madhya pradesh in particular was the first success towards controlled breeding in india though two types of bundh breeding techniques viz the perennial wet bundh and the seasonal or dry bundh were followed for fish seed production during the 1960s1980s they were largely dependent on the environmental conditions and achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 181were with limited success with the development of induced breeding and larval rearing techniques for several commercially important fish and shellfish species subsequently the seed requirement at present is completely met by hatcheryproduced seed the studies on inducing maturation of fishes covered a wide range of inducing agents viz hcg lhrh lhrha and homologous and heterologous fish pituitary gland extracts the first effective induced breeding of carp however was achieved in cirrhinus reba on 10 th july 1957 in just 15 days all the three indian major carps were then successfully induced bred chaudhuri and alikunhi 1957 induced breeding with the injection of carp pituitary gland pg extract created a novel seed production avenue chaudhuri 1960 the efficiency of the pg extract was reliant on the freshness potency and storage processes of the gland which however made its use challenging due to potency inconsistencies it also required two injections and too much handling of brooders resulting in postspawning mortality the technology of induced breeding became simple and userfriendly after the development of the synthetic hormone ovaprim by syndel laboratory in canada it was subsequently standardized for effective use in carps and later in other fishes in the country several other inducing agents are presently available for use the breeding technique has been standardized for 40 commerciallyimportant freshwater food fishes apart from many ornamental fishes raizada et al 2019 icarcifa developed a protocol for multiple spawning which involves breeding the same brooders four times within the same season gupta et al 1995 the multiple spawning technique demonstrated 23 folds higher spawn recovery over conventional single breeding standardization of cryopreservation technique for carp milt in the 1990s lowered the requirement of male broodstock population in hatcheries overcoming the problem of inbreeding in many hatcheries manipulation of the environment for offseason carp breeding was also attempted with photothermal regulation in the 2000s resulting in an extension in the breeding season sarkar et al 2010 further the development of a broodstock diet cifabrood tm ensured early broodstock maturation the commercial availability of which is facilitating early breeding in carps along with the advancement of fish breeding research significant advances were also made in the development of different hatchery systems from the simple hatching pit to the current eco hatchery the ecohatchery system is continued as the principal method of massscale carp seed production of late the portable frp hatchery system has been developed by icar cifa for decentralized seed production even in remote areas with increased focus on species diversification technologies were also developed for breeding and seed production of several other important cultivable species over these years which include the minor carps and barbs kalbasu labeo calbasu fringedlipped carp l fimbriatus kuria labeo l gonius bata l bata olive barb systomus sarana sarana pengba osteobrama belangeri etc murrels channa striata and c marulius climbing perch anabas testudineus and catfishes magur clarias magur singhi heteropneustes fossilis pabda ompok pabda o bimaculatus yellow catfish horabagrus brachysoma etc jena et al 2020 with the increased popularity of farming of the striped catfish pangasianodon hypophthalmus and to meet the seed demand indigenous hatchery models were developed by the farmers of west bengalindian agriculture after independence 182the development of the seed production technology for freshwater prawns was another milestone in the freshwater sector following the successful closure of the life cycle of the giant freshwater prawn macrobrachium rosenbergii in captivity a successful hatchery model was developed at icarcifa the seed requirement of m rosenbergii was met by establishing commercial hatcheries in the coastal states following this success a similar hatchery system was also developed by icarcifa for the two other prawn species viz m malcolmsonii indian river prawn and m gangeticum ganga river prawn considering the necessity of saline water of about 12 for seed production of m rosenbergii icarcentral institute of fisheries education cife also developed the hatchery technology of the species with the use of artificial seawater which was demonstrated in several land locked states 2212 seed rearing development of the seed rearing technique was the other concurrent progress that took place along with the induced breeding with continued efforts towards the development and standardization of seed rearing technology packages of practices were developed for twotire seed rearing in carps ie a nursery phase where the spawn of 67 mm size are reared at 510 million ha 1 to fry of 2025 mm in 1520 days and b rearing phase where the fry are reared at 0203 million ha1 to 610 cm fingerlings in 7590 days the packages of practices of the basic rearing technology involved prestocking pond preparation eradication of unwanted fishes and aquatic insects ph correction manuring fertilization seed stocking stocking density species ratio acclimatization poststocking pond management maintenance of natural productivity through manuringfertilization supplementary feeding health management harvesting and seed transport conditioning packaging and transport condition effective management of the pond ecosystem including maintenance of water quality was given prime importance during the rearing period most of the basic technologies of carp seed production are credited to the efforts of the pond culture division of cifri at cuttack during the 1970s and subsequently at fartc and icarcifa kausalyaganga bhubaneswar ayyappan et al 2015 until the beginning of 21 st century earthen pond was the basic resource used for seed rearing of carps and it was often marred with poor seed survival and growth the effectiveness of concrete tank systems for highdensity seed rearing has been demonstrated not only in carps but also for other species the bettercontrolled environment in the tank system has made it possible to achieve higher growth survival and input use efficiency with the increasing demand for larger seeds for growout stocking in recent years the development of another tier of seed rearing is gaining increasing focus to raise stunted juveniles around the year seed rearing techniques for species other than carps are mostly speciesspecific and are evolving over the years with regard to stocking density and the requirement of different inputs most of the catfish during early life stages show cannibalism and hence require periodic size segregation to improve seed survival a similar technique is also being used for the rearing of murrel seed the early larval stage of magur requires lower water depth 810 cm in the tanks as the larva has to travel from the water column to the surface for achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 183obligatory airbreathing indoor rearing is done during the 1st phase of rearing 2000 3000 m2 for 1214 days in wellaerated tanks to reach 1012 mm fry 3040 mg size the 2nd phase of rearing for 30 days is carried out at 200300 m2 density in outdoor tanks provided with a 68 cm soil base to reach the fingerlings size of 34 cm 0810 g in the case of freshwater prawns the postlarvae are reared at high stocking densities of 2000 5000 m2 for 1015 days 2213 growout production technologies in fishes and freshwater prawn the carp polyculture technology frequently referred to as composite carp culture was developed by the erstwhile pond culture division of cifri in the 1960s and 1970s involving three indian major carps namely catla rohu and mrigal only and with a combination of three indian major carps and three exotic carps namely silver carp common carp and grass carp alikunhi et al 1971 chaudhuri et al 1974 1975 it has been the most important growout culture technology practiced in the country however with several needbased modifications by the farmers in different regions the development of this technology involved systematic trials with varied species combinations and densities which again depended on the information generated on biology habitat preference food and feeding habits growth rate and compatibility of important species this was a major contributing factor in the blue revolution in the country much of the subsequent research and development on this subject was conducted through an all india coordinated research project aicrp on composite culture of indian and exotic fishes initiated by the cifri in 1971 and renamed composite fish culture and fish seed production which operated at 12 locations until 1984 during 198994 icarcifa undertook a major research programme on intensive carp culture and achieved higher fish production levels of 1015 t ha 1 yr1 with the use of balanced supplementary feed biofertilization with azolla and aeration tripathi et al 2000 this was a landmark achievement in freshwater pond production a large number of developmental projects starting from the 1960s helped towards effective dissemination of the technologies even though the introduction of exotic silver carp grass carp and common carp into the carp polyculture system could demonstrate achieving higher production their incorporation into the commercial farming practice has remained low due to low consumer preference however common carp has been one of the important soughtafter species especially for seasonal water bodies production levels of 45 t ha 1 yr1 with the adoption of technology of carp polyculture although is quite a common feature in most parts of the country higher production levels of 812 t ha1 yr1 are being achieved by several farmers in andhra pradesh punjab and haryana ayyappan and jena 2005 with the emphasis on species diversification efforts have been made to introduce several minor carp species into the conventional major carpbased carp production system in several states a new concept minor carp intercropping in carp polyculture has demonstrated 2025 higher yield and over 30 higher profit with the extensive promotion of icar cifa the olive barb has now been well established in the culture system of eastern and indian agriculture after independence 184northeastern states such an effort has also helped in recovering the species from the iucn status of near threatened to least concerned at present similarly the promotion of pengba during the last decade has helped its spread from northeastern states to odisha and west bengal olive barb kalbasu and pengba are also being promoted by the national freshwater fish brood bank nffbb established in bhubaneswar by the national fisheries development board nfdb species like fringed lipped carp and kuria labeo have also been promoted in the culture sector in different states but the adoption of the latter has not been so far impressive due to its slower growth whereas the exotic silver barb has been widely adopted in many indian states initial faster growth wider feed acceptability small head size and good appearance besides autobreeding habit have been the advantages for its growing adoption of farming along with major carps research over the years has led to the development refinement and standardization of a host of technologies with varying production levels depending on the input use specific low inputbased farming involving aquatic macrophytesbased carp polyculture and biogas slurryfed fish culture could also demonstrate impressive production levels of 34 t ha 1 yr1 multiple cropping with two crops in a year single stockingmultiple harvest and multiple stockingmultiple harvests are some of the culture systems which proved to be advantageous over the yearlong monocropping practice striped catfish has become the second leading cultured species after the indian major carp group in the pond culture system and is also a prime choice for cage culture in the open waters although the species had an illegal introduction during the 1990s the higher growth potential culture feasibility at highdensity under monoculture and most importantly the government nod that was given for its culture in 2005 after due environmental impact assessment study have helped its expanded farming andhra pradesh has been at the forefront of striped catfish culture where the area coverage has steadily increased since the early 2000s to reach the maximum of 32000 ha in 2010 with yield levels of 1720 t ha 1 belton et al 2017 under an intensive culture setup with the use of floating feed higher yield levels of 4050 t ha1 are also often reported of late increased adoption of the species in other states viz chhattisgarh bihar jharkhand uttar pradesh punjab etc under both pondbased and cage culture systems however has led to reduced market price leading to shrinkage of area coverage in andhra pradesh belton et al 2017 pacu is another important species widely adopted by the farmers despite its pending government approval the increased popularity of the species has paved the way for its entry into the seed supply chain with the start of its culture in the west godavari district of andhra pradesh in 2004 ramakrishna et al 2013 the farming area has increased substantially in andhra pradesh alone at present pacu is cultured in almost 2600 ha either in monoculture or polyculture with major carps and striped catfish seshagiri et al 2022 the culture of pacu in recent years has spread to other states such as maharashtra tamil nadu karnataka kerala uttar pradesh bihar odisha and northeastern states there has been a growing interest in the culture of improved monosex tilapia and red tilapia of course with certain governmental restrictions the adoption of farming practices in the country however is highly diverse and largely dependent on the input availability and investment capacity of the farmers achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 185with the implementation of the aicrp on airbreathing fish culture the significance of catfish farming in the country was recognized the preliminary culture techniques for magur singhi murrels and climbing perch were essentially borne out of this in 56 months of monoculture in small and shallow ponds production levels of 35 tons magur ha1 were demonstrated furthermore new research efforts on seed production and farming of climbing perch and murrels have demonstrated the possibility of monoculture of these species in the northeastern states the monoculture of magur and pabda is becoming more popular the adoption of the technology of growout monoculture of giant freshwater prawn took momentum during 200005 the species also garnered increasing attention for its farming in polyculture with major carps coculture of carps and prawns resulted in higher yields with production values of 300500 kg prawns ha 1 and 2030 tons carps ha1 freshwater prawn production climbed gradually to 35000 tons in 2005 however with the white leg shrimp l vannamei attained popularity the expansion of freshwater prawns showed a gradual decline prawn farming is found to resurge in the last few years in the coastal zone as a result of the rising problem of l vannamei culture in 201920 the production of freshwater prawns reached 9500 tons although the culture of freshwater prawn faces tough competition from l vannamei in coastal zones strengthening the seed production and supply chain in the landlocked states besides coastal zones would provide ample opportunity for culture promotion of the species the nonconventional culture practices viz sewagefed fish culture and integrated fish farming with cattle pig duck and poultry use carps as the principal component yield production levels of 35 t ha 1 yr1 ayyappan and jena 2003 integration of highvalued horticulture crops on pond dyke has been accepted as a popular model integrated farming models have gained popularity in recent years due to their holistic approach to crop production with efficient nutrient recycling and resource utilization this type of system has been proved to be useful for rural small household ponds fish production from the sewagefed impoundments has been a practice that evolved since the 1930s and was largely practiced by the fish farmers of west bengal the rahara centre of icarcifa which formerly was under icarcifri before reorganization of institutes has undertaken studies on the various kind of sewage its utilization for fish farming and the aftereffect on fish as well as in the food chain fish production levels of 3050 t ha 1 yr1 have been demonstrated under carp polyculture and monoculture of c reba and l bata in sewage fed ponds paddycumfish culture with customized models for different regions has also shown its potential with the production of about 500 kg fish and 2535 tons of deepwater paddy in one hectare the practice is being successfully adopted in several parts of odisha assam and other northeastern states enclosure aquaculture cage and pen culture has been a promising intervention to increase the fish production potential of the large water bodies as was demonstrated over these years by icarcifri the institute has demonstrated stock enhancement in selected wetlands of assam through pen culture which had later been adopted in many chaur and indian agriculture after independence 186moan resources of eastern indian states including bihar chhattisgarh jharkhand and flood plains of assam and west bengal the bangalore center of icarcifa has also worked towards developing cage farming technology in reservoirs during the 1980s and 1990s several schemes have been brought by nfdb with the technology partnership of icarcifri and implemented through state fisheries departments to increase the cage farming activities in open waters such activities are implemented with an integrated approach as an alternative livelihood and income generation programme under the blue revolution scheme of the government of india with the financial support of the rkvy scheme chhattisgarh was the pioneer state to start commercial cage farming in 200708 in reservoirs high production levels of 3040 tons of p hypophthalmus per cage 6 m 4 m 4 m were achieved in 68 months of rearing later the cage farming technology has been adopted in the reservoir systems of many states especially in jharkhand bihar odisha and maharashtra 2214 aquaculture in upland region the fisheries development in the upland region till the last century was mostly concentrated on stocking the streams and lakes with fry and fingerlings of desired species several exotic trout species were imported to kashmir in the first half of the twentieth century to enhance sport fishing icardcfr has been working towards improving fish production potential through culturebased capture fisheries and developing cage farming technology for the utilization of himalayan lakes in the mid2010s the institute imported two improved hungarian common carp strains and demonstrated their superior growth in the upland areas native species like mahseers tor putitora and tor tor snow trouts schizothoraichthys esocinus s progastus schizothorax richardsonii s niger and s curvifrons have been bred and promoted in the culture system icardcfr has also developed induced breeding and seed rearing technologies for schizothoraichthys niger s esocinus s curvifrons s micropogon and schizothorax richardsonii through artificial fecundation in running water systems the seed of golden and chocolate mahseers have been extensively ranched in upland streams rivers and lakes to increase their natural population apart from the trout deccan mahseer tor khudree has received much attention during the last 40 years mostly due to the commendable work of a privately owned hatchery of tata electric company at lonavla the lonavla hatchery has also developed induced breeding and hatching of t putitora table 3 milestones in freshwater aquaculture research year milestone

seafood species including fish shrimp crab seaweed microalgae and others brackishwater aquaculture has a long history of traditional practices from bheries of west bengal to pokkali rice fields of kerala brackishwater aquaculture at present is largely confined to a single commodity the shrimp the shrimp production in the country currently stands at more than 08 mt 90 is l vannamei from an area of 172000 hectares with average productivity of 4070 kg ha 1 crop1 in 2020 2221 breeding seed production and growout farming of shrimps and crabs in india scientific shrimp farming was initiated in kakdwip experimental brackishwater fish farm of icarcifri west bengal subsequently the shrimp breeding and seed production technology was evolved in narakkal kochi by the icarcmfri ponnaiah 2011 a simplified hatchery system was developed for penaeus indicus in 1976 muthu and laxminarayana 1977 silas et al 1985 in 1975 aicrp on brackishwater fish farming started with centers in west bengal odisha andhra pradesh tamil nadu kerala and goa the yield was improved to 10001500 kg ha 1 with improvised farmmade feeds and health management in the late 1980s the mpeda established two commercial hatcheries viz tasparc at vishakhapatnam and osparc in gopalpur which paved the way for the establishment of several private hatcheries in subsequent years a semiintensive culture technology demonstrated in the early 1990s yielding 46 t ha 1 production through a pilotscale project by mpeda was a significant milestone the 1990s witnessed significant growth in the adoption of commercial farming of black tiger shrimp subsequently with the overall technical and logistical support from different organizations viz icarciba and mpeda india witnessed an extraordinary increase in the area under shrimp farming one of the major turning points in brackishwater shrimp farming was the introduction of specific pathogen free spf l vannamei in 2009 the introduction of spf l vannamei followed by strict quarantine at the country level and biosecurity at the farmhatchery level strict adherence to better management practices bmps and zero tolerance for antibiotics usage have transformed the sector the adoption of ecobased technologies for sustainable indian agriculture after independence 188intensifications was actively mediated by icarciba with semiclosed intensive shrimp farming and bmps productivity of 810 t ha1 was achieved farming over the years has seen a gradual expansion in crop area not only in traditional states like andhra pradesh tamil nadu odisha and west bengal but also in gujarat the shrimp production increased by over 30folds during the last 33 years from 28000 tons in 198889 to 843360 tons in 202021 while p monodon contributes less than 3 of shrimp production the remaining have been by l vannamei following the tremendous success of l vannamei farming in the coastal region icarcife at its regional centre of rohtak haryana was instrumental in developing the packages of practices for its commercial farming in inlandsaline areas the extensive demonstration programme by the center has resulted in largescale adoption of its farming in the states of haryana punjab and inland saline areas of other landlocked states penaeus indicus has shown to be a potential candidate species alternative to p monodon or l vannamei recent studies highlight its potential in zerowaterexchange systems and cultivation prospects in ecobased farming systems icarciba has standardized the culture practice of p indicus in different agroclimatic zones a nationwide culture demonstration showed a yield potential of 37 t ha 1 crop1 at a moderate stocking density of 2540 nos m2 recently to diversify shrimp farming selectively bred spf fastgrowing and diseaseresistant variety of p monodon was introduced in india it is reported that the growth rate and wssv resistance has been improved after each generation icarciba is facilitating the farming of spfpm at low stocking density it is expected that the bzest biosecured zero water exchange system technology technology developed by icarciba will ensure the successful culture and sustainability of this newly introduced species the institute has also successfully standardized hatchery seed production and farming technologies for other penaeid species like banana shrimp p merguiensis kuruma shrimp marsupenaeus japonicas pink shrimp metapenaeus monoceros and kadal shrimp m dobsoni mud crab scylla serrata is a highvalue seafood most suitable for low intensive brackishwater farming the hatchery technology for mud crab has been developed by rgca the research and development arm of mpeda and also icarciba over a decade the commercial seed production of the species however is principally limited to the hatchery facility of rgca and a few small hatcheries in tamil nadu and maharashtra in growout culture the long rearing period of 1012 months to raise from 1 g to 500 g poor survival and associated production loss are a dampener for the farmers to avoid these a threetier modular farming system or zero stocking model was developed by icarciba which is getting popular in different states it fetches rs 10001400 kg 1 in export market 2222 breeding seed production and growout farming of brackishwater finfishes technology development aimed at species diversification has been a focus over the years the lack of seed of important cultivable fish species for want of hatchery seed production achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 189technology remained a major bottleneck for a long period icarciba achieved a technological breakthrough for the yearround breeding of seabass lates calcarifer under the captive condition in the year 1997 followed by a novel system of farming arasu et al 2009 the institute made significant progress in developing a mature broodstock of seabass in captivity thirunavukkarasu et al 2015 the technique of implantation of lhrha in pellet form in fish was developed lhrha in conjunction with hcg was responsible for achieving maturation further sustainable farming of seabass in open brackishwater cages in a threetier model was also popularized as an alternate livelihood for coastal fishers induced breeding of milkfish chanos chanos was achieved by icarciba in 2015 as another significant milestone milkfish can be farmed in monoculture or polyculture with other species which grow to a marketable size of 500 g in six months the institute has also successfully bred the grey mullet mugil cephalus a highvalued brackishwater fish with pond reared broodstock in 201617 diverse culture systems such as monoculture polyculture and imta are suitable for this species and yield 40 t ha 1 crop1 similarly the

with seaweed and bivalve culture institutes such as icarciba and the national institute of ocean technology niot and agencies such as mpeda played prominent roles in expanding research and development activities for mariculture subsequently trials on opensea cage farming were initiated by icarcmfri in the mid2000s though india has a projected mariculture indian agriculture after independence 190production potential of 48 mt annually the current mariculture production is 01 mt 2231 opensea cage culture opensea cage farming in india was initiated by icarcmfri with the implementation of a demonstration project at four locations viz diu ratnagiri mandapam and visakhapatnam the first successful opensea cage culture harvest was achieved in 2007 at visakhapatnam with seabass in hdpe cages of 15 m diameter since then the institute has been able to make several innovations in the designing and fabrication of cages and mooring systems and standardized guidelines and practices the lowcost cage farming technology was very well accepted by the fishermen groups and entrepreneurs in various maritime states two different versions of indigenously fabricated 6 m dia cages gi and hdpe are presently being adopted by fishermen a major scheme on sea cage farming was operational with the financial assistance of nfdb and technical support of icarcmfri in the states of maharashtra tamil nadu kerala and karnataka under the blue revolution scheme of the union government during 201720 at present cobia pompano and seabass are the major species used which however are likely to diversify with other species like grouper snapper and seabream icarcmfri based on multicriteria evaluation mce parameters has identified an area of 46823 hectares of suitable sites along the indian coastline for sea cage farming it is estimated that a total of 07 million cages can be installed in the identified sites which can yield over 20 mt of fish a planned programme to commercialize sea farming will go a long way in realizing the blue economy potential in india 2232 culture of seaweeds and integrated multitrophic aquaculture imta since the late 1970s icarcmfri has been at the forefront of seaweed research cmfris mandapam regional station has devised a raft coirrope netsspore system for commercialscale culture of the agar yielding red algae gracilaria edulis and gelidiella acerosa during the 1980s the station created a cottage industry method for producing agar from gracilaria spp and alginic acid from sargassum spp and showed agar and algin production to several farmers and entrepreneurs many smallscale agar factories in madurai tamil nadu have sprung up as a result of these demonstrations seaweed farming in india is currently centered on the exotic carrageenanproducing kappaphycus alvarezii grown along the coastal waters of tamil nadu and gujarat its culture was initiated in the year 2000 with technical assistance from the central salt and marine chemicals research institute csmcri bhavnagar icarcmfri has identified a potential area of 23970 hectares and 317 sites for seaweed farming all across the coast this includes 10316 ha area in gujarat 5048 ha in tamil nadu 2724 ha in maharashtra besides smaller stretches in other coastal states it is estimated that the identified potential area can produce about 100 mt of seaweeds wet weight integration of commercially relevant species at various trophic levels is developing as a new concept in aquaculture in which the nutrient loads generated from fed species such as finfish or shrimp act as fertilizers or inputs for the nonfed extractive secondary species achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 191such as molluscs or seaweeds cocultured this technique is being used in cage aquaculture where finfishshrimp and shellherbivorous fish are mixed with seaweed cultivation in appropriate proportions this approach can help to alleviate the adverse effects on the environment of sea cage farming while also increasing seaweed yield in this regard the icarcmfri successfully demonstrated the technology of integrated multitrophic aquaculture imta combining seaweed k alvarezii with cobia 2233 culture of bivalve molluscs bivalves oysters mussels clams and cockles are widely distributed in the tropical and temperate waters in india they form a sustenance fishery for the coastal people in the west coast maritime states from time immemorial the commercially important bivalve resources of india comprise the edible oyster crassostrea spp mussel green mussel perna viridis and brown mussel p indica pearl oyster pinctada fucata and p margaritifera and clams villorita spp meretrix spp paphia malabarica and marcia opima the annual bivalve production through wild harvest from the coastal waters and estuaries was estimated at 86100 tons during 201219 icarcmfri developed the mussel culture technique in the late 1970s however its farming remained confined only to southwest india with a limited level of production further refinements in farming technology have also been made to reduce capital costs by using alternate core materials development of the hatchery technology for the production of bivalve seed including both green and brown mussels is another development icarcmfri also developed oyster farming technology in the 1970s using the rack and ren and rack and tray methods the average annual farmed edible oyster production in india however is only around 3000 tons forming approximately 15 of farmed bivalves seed production techniques of the species have been standardized similar to mussels 2234 breeding and seed production of marine fishes to ensure a sustained seed supply of important species for cage culture icarcmfri initiated breeding programmes of cobia and silver pompano in 2006 induced breeding technologies of these species were successfully developed at its mandapam regional centre in 2010 and 2011 respectively seed production technologies including nursery rearing protocols were standardized for commerciallevel production sea cage farming technology was standardized through various farming trials and participatory demonstrations during 201113 induced breeding and seed production of orangespotted grouper epinephelus coioides was first achieved in 2013 and its largescale seed production with higher survival rates during larval rearing was accomplished in 2017 indian pompano trachinotus mookalee is another potential candidate species for marine and brackishwater aquaculture which was induced bred in 2016 with high survival rates 20 the technologies have been transferred to the private entrepreneurs thereby facilitating round the year seed production of these four species of importance recently the institute has also standardized breeding and seed production technologies of another three highvalue species suitable for cage farming viz pinkear sea bream lethrinus lentjan pomadasys furcatus and johns snapper lutjanus johnii the

farming of ornamental fishes the rich ornamental fish resources of the country both in terms of freshwater as well as marine species have not been tapped to their fullest potential yet while the domestic trade of ornamental fish is dominated by exotic varieties the export is largely confined to wildcaught freshwater indigenous fishes with the research efforts in icarcifa icarcifa icarnofgr and other state agricultural universities breeding and rearing techniques of over two dozen indigenous species from neh eastern and the western ghat regions have been standardized during the last three decades this comprises barbs danios rasboras catfish and chameleon fish the development of shining barb a new variety of rosy barb pethia conchonius through the process is another significant contribution of icarcifa the development of captive breeding technologies of brackishwater ornamental fishes viz spotted scat scatophagus argus silver moony monodactylus argenteus and orange chromide etroplus maculatus by icarciba have been some of the recent advancements icarcmfri initiated the work on the development of captive breeding and seed production of marine ornamentals in the 1990s these efforts culminated in the development of captive breeding technology for 23 marine ornamental species which include clownfishes under genera amphiprion and premnas damselfishes achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 193under genera dascyllus pomacentrus chromis neopomacentrus and chrysiptera anthias pseudanthias marcia p squamipinnis firefish nemeteleotris decora dotty back pseudochromis dialect and camel shrimp rhyncocinetes durbanensis recently breeding and seed production of five designer clownfishes crossbred and two ornamental crustaceans thor hainanensis and acylocaris brevicarpalis peacock tail shrimp were also achieved 2242 marine and freshwater pearl culture in india the technology for pearl culture has been developed by icarcmfri for marine pearls and icarcifa for freshwater pearls alagarswami 1974 janaki ram 1989 icarcifa developed the technology of freshwater pearl farming in the late 1980s using freshwater mussels viz lamellidens marginalis l corrianus and parreysia corrugata the former being the most important species to obtain shellattached halfround or design pearls as well as unattached and irregular to oval or round pearls packages of practices for preoperative conditioning graft and nuclei implantation postoperative care and pond culture of implanted mussels were developed icarcmfri initiated the pearl culture research at its tuticorin centre in 1972 and succeeded in producing spherical pearls in 1973 subsequently the technology of mabeimage pearls has also been developed the production of finequality white and black pearls was with the use of the species pinctada fucata and p margaritifera respectively the institute was also successful in artificially spawning pinctada fucata raising larvae and producing yearround seed in the laboratory 225 modern farming practices bioflocbased aquaculture and farming in ras and raceways bioflocbased farming technology is based on management through heterotrophic microflora promoted and maintained through carbonnitrogen cn ratio manipulation which can achieve higher productivity through the sustainable intensification concept it is practiced in both freshwater and brackishwater systems with a wide range of species like shrimp l vannamei p indicus and p monodon tilapia pangas carps and native air breathing fishes icarciba has standardized the technology protocols for bioflocbased nursery and growout culture technology of penaeid shrimps production of 400600 kg of tilapiapangas or 5060 kg of shrimp can be achieved from a 10 tone tank system recirculatory aquaculture system ras is considered an environmentfriendly aquaculture farming system though highly capital intensive ras system uses much less water and land facility compared to the flowthrough system moreover with welldeveloped filtration technology greater control over disease outbreaks and water quality parameters higher production is possible in this system research is also in progress for developing models for maturation and growout systems for marine finfish and shrimps intensive culture technology in the raceway system was also developed for highvalue rainbow trout for the temperate hilly terrain of jammu kashmir himachal pradesh indian agriculture after independence 194uttarakhand etc by icardcfr production levels of 500700 kg raceway1 in 10 months culture period have been obtained in raceways of 3045 m2 at a stocking density of 40100 fingerlings m2 and provision of formulated pellet feed 226 fish feed and nutrition fish nutrition research in india received increased attention only in the 1980s focusing on understanding the dietary requirements of cultured species for the production of balanced supplementary feed besides the icar institutes the fisheries colleges under the sauscaus and several other laboratories including at delhi university aligarh muslim university etc undertake fish nutrition studies in india the research largely involved the use of different plant and animal protein sources the studies also covered the aspects of nonconventional feed ingredients additives antinutritional factors digestive enzymes probioticsgut microflora etc several formulations have been developed for varied life stages of important finfishes of freshwater brackishwater and marine origin and freshwater prawns and shrimps fish feeds for carps magur and freshwater prawn had been formulated and released by icarcifa in the 1990s recently icarcifri has developed and commercialized a formulated feed known as cifri cagegrow for cage culture in inland waters the broodfish diet cifabroodtm developed by icarcifa in 2009 and commercialized in 2013 showed its efficiency in advancing gonad growth and maturation facilitating early spawning and increasing spawning response in 2020 the institute has also developed carp feed fortified with nanoparticles for larvae and growout stages and released for commercial production floating sinking and slowsinking forms of commercial feeds in varied pellet sizes are now available in the market shrimp being a highvalue species at its initial stage of aquaculture development in the country it necessitated the import of formulated feeds subsequently several shrimp feed mills were established resulting in selfsufficiency highly costeffective indigenous shrimp feed technology was later developed and commercialized by icarciba for both tiger shrimp and pacific white shrimp vanami plus a costeffective shrimp feed was developed by using indigenous ingredient resources other important feeds include extruded floating and slow sinking feed for brood and growout culture of mullet milkfish and seabass development of alternate protein sources for fish meal replacement using customized enzyme mixtures and solidstate fermentation technology and functional feeds for various life stages are other achievements the research at icarcmfri led to the development of nutritional solutions of both basic and applied nature for different marine fish species rd at icar cmfri icarciba and icarcifa has resulted in commercially scalable technologies including varsha and varna brand of ornamental fish feeds from icarcmfri and kolorfishplus from icarciba however feeds for ornamental fish and microfeeds for nursery rearing of cage cultured fish are mostly imported commercial production of such feeds is yet to be taken up in the country as the volume of production demanded is below commercial viabilityachievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 195227 fish genetics biotechnology genetic improvement of culture species was an important research area that attracted the attention of researchers even in the early years of aquaculture development over 40 interspecific and intergeneric hybrids were produced at the fartc but proved to have limited practical relevance as none of them demonstrated to have significantly higher growth potential than their parents with the studies conducted on the manipulation of chromosome sets success was achieved in inducing ploidy and the production of androgens and gynogens the triploids and gynogens also could not be translated into fieldlevel adoption later emphasis was given to the traitassociated selective breeding of the cultured species which was a great success the genetic research during the initial years was largely confined to cytogenetic studies in fishes to characterize the species in terms of diploid chromosome numbers 2n morphology karyotype staining of nucleolar organizer regions nors of chromosomes patterns of constitutive heterochromatic and physical location of genes on chromosomes the icar nbfgr has undertaken cytogenetic studies on over 80 species including endemic and endangered species belonging to freshwater marine and brackishwater ecosystems ranging from plains and himalayan foothills to the western ghats development of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish as a tool for physical mapping of repetitive dna and study of the variation between and within species has also been undertaken in over 20 fish species development of the first selective breeding programme in india was undertaken in rohu at icarcifa through an indonorwegian project akv aforsk norway in the early1990s with growth as the trait of selection reddy et al 1999 the impressive success achieved with an average of 17 higher growth response per generation after 11 th generation of selection is a significant development with 5060 higher growth demonstrated in the farmers pond across the country the improved rohu popularly known as jayanti rohu is a soughtafter strain further resistance to aeromonas sp has been included as another trait of selection sahoo et al 2011 similar selective breeding programmes for growth have been extended to improve catla and giant freshwater prawn with 30 higher growth demonstrated in catla and freshwater prawn after 2 nd and 10th generations respectively these improved strains possess great potential for increasing productivity in freshwater aquaculture systems a similar genetic improvement programme has been initiated in magur by icarcife rgca has also developed 8 th generation of tilapia gift through pedigreed selective breeding with procurement of initial germplasm from worldfish in 2008 which is expected to play a significant role in the expansion of tilapia farming in the country in 1991 the first triploid transgenic brachydanio rerio was developed followed by the first indian transgenic zebrafish in 1995 transgenic rohu and singhi grew four times faster in culture conditions than their nontransgenic counterparts and transformed food with much higher efficiency pandian 2003 extensive research efforts in the last few years have led to wholegenome sequencing of six fishshellfish species viz rohu catla magur hilsa indian agriculture after independence 196grey mullet and indian white shrimp transcriptome analysis and gene mining efforts in fish species have resulted in a greater understanding of abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms which include hypoxia ammonia and temperature and biological processes in magur immune system lipid metabolism in hilsa and growth in catla and hilsa sequencing mapping and annotation of mitogenomes of more than 50 important fish species have been completed the network project on agricultural bioinformatics and computational biology has established an online portal fisomics to support fish genomic data analysis the portal also provides access to important genomic resource databases of indian fishes and other aquatic life like fbis coi barcodes fishmicrosat microsatellite information fmir mitogenomes fish karyome chromosome information and hrgfish hypoxia responsive genes 228 fish health management with the intensification and diversification of aquaculture and increased transboundary movement of fish seed the disease incidence in fish farming has increased significantly over these years necessitating greater emphasis on fish health research research on fish diseases received increased attention with the emergence of the epizootic ulcerative syndrome eus in freshwater finfish in the late 1980s and white spot syndrome wssv in shrimps in the late 1990s which caused havoc in the fisheries sector of india and neighbouring countries icar institutes have focused fish health research mainly on three aspects identification of fish and shellfish diseases development of diagnostics and development of disease control measures during the 1980s 1990s eus caused heavy loss across the country with heavy morbidity and mortality especially in eastern and northeastern states of india extensive studies encompassing fungal bacterial and viral pathogens were conducted and it was established that the oomycete aphanomyces invadans is the causative pathogen for the eus the development of a chemical formulation known as cifax in 1998 by icarcifa and its commercial availability was significant in preventing and controlling the eus to a large extent the development of both histological and molecular techniques has helped in the rapid diagnosis of eus cifacure was another formulation developed for controlling common bacterial and fungal infections of freshwater ornamental fishes besides wssv which caused the worst economic losses in the brackishwater shrimp farming systems a large number of viral pathogens such as infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus ihhnv monodon baculosvirus mbv yellow head disease infectious myonecrosis virus imnv hepatopancreatic parovirus hpv shrimp noda virus etc have been identified to cause substantial loss in shrimp and prawn in india pathologies of several bacterial diseases in diverse finfishes were studied viral diseases have been relatively less in finfishes in india however recently tilapia lake virus tilv has been found to cause a massive loss in tilapia farms a vast array of parasites from protozoa to metazoans has been identified to cause infections in several teleost fish species and cause acute to chronic losses the efficacy of doramectin and ivermectin was evaluated against argulus siamensis infestation with a promising outcome ammonium chloride dip bath achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 197treatment as a quarantine measure to prevent the spread of lernaea cyprinacea infection was quite promising recently antiparasitic formulations such as cifri argcure and ciba paracide have been developed and fieldtested a biofilmbased immune stimulant was developed for controlling bacterial infections in shrimp leading to improved survival and growth cibalumiphage a novel phage therapy has been developed for the control of bacterial diseases in shrimp larvae recombinant rdrp protein of prawn noda virus mrnv as antiviral immunostimulant in m rosenbergii is another major achievement recently nanoparticles are being tested for antimicrobial immunomodulatory growth promoting and water remediating activities an indigenous vaccine nodavacr has been developed for the control of viral nervous necrosis vnn in asian seabass other major vaccines include a hydrophila subunit vaccine against aeromoniasis and a recombinant dna vaccine against edwardsiella tarda studies also focused on the role of trls in innate immunity in divergent fish species to utilize in disease prevention the development of several diagnostic kits has helped in the early detection of causative pathogens and early warnings for combating the disease outbreaks wssv has been thoroughly characterized and pcrbased tests have been developed for the diagnosis of the disease pcrbased diagnostic kits have also been developed for several other viruses viz yellow head virus yhv khv tilv and taura syndrome virus reverse transcriptase loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp for the detection of beta noda virus vnn was developed besides molecular diagnostics for several oielisted pathogens a colony multiplex pcr cmpcr was developed for rapid detection of bacillus and pseudomonas genera from diverse ecological niches rapid dnabased diagnostic assays utilizing pcr have also been developed for gyrodactylus salaris g elegans dactylogyrus intermedius myxobolus cerebralis and m clarii the latest in the list includes a nested pcr kit for rapid detection of enterocytozoon hepatopenaei ehp in shrimp besides molecular techniques microbiological microscopic and immunological techniques have also been used for the diagnosis of pathogens a

antibiotics microbiological interventions challenge studies of different foodborne pathogens different haccpbased packages of practices development of quality index schemes etc icarcift has developed a chlorine level indicator paper called cloritest in the 1980s for instant reading of the chlorine levels in process water this easytouse concept and the technology since then is widely adopted in the industry with many commercial companies producing similar kits not only for the fish processing industry but also for many industrial and other noncommercial applications two simple and userfriendly kits namely ciftest developed by icarcift have been successful in determining the adulteration of ammonia and formaldehyde in fish which are also commercialized 3 knowledge gaps and way forward one of the greatest concerns for india in the 21st century is food and nutrition security for a predicted population of over 16 billion by 2050 in the face of economic and financial uncertainty climate change and increasing competition for natural resources the fishery production systems that could contribute significantly to future food production are increasingly under pressure due to rapid resource degradation as a result of anthropogenic activities including pollution from landbased sources climate change increase in achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 203hypoxic areas or dead zones the spread of alien species and ocean acidification these challenges necessitate a coordinated response and a swift transition to a more sustainable inclusive and resourceefficient course for the future to build resilience in fisheries and sustainability in aquaculture the government of indias projections for 202425 includes the production of 22 million tons of fish at an average annual growth of about 9 doubling export earnings from the present rs 46663 crores 201920 to about rs 100000 crores enhancing national average aquaculture productivity from 35 tons to 5 t ha 1 increasing the per capita domestic fish consumption from about 8 kg to about 12 kg and reducing postharvest losses from the reported 2025 to about 10 to achieve the potential of the sector the following efforts are suggested the marine catches are plateauing and prompt action is necessary to resolve the underlying causes overcapacity in the fisheries sector is a severe issue overfishing and excessive juvenile catch are triggered by economic and social compulsions the fishing effort needs to be optimized by i regulating fishing vessel design and construction with more focus on energyefficient fishing and strategies for making green vessels ii regulating fishing gear concerning mesh size and gear dimension iii regulating destructive fishing methods such as pair trawlingbull trawling and mini trawling and iv strict implementation of spatial zoning regulations the potential of artificial intelligence ai and big data is enormous which can be utilized for effective monitoring control and surveillance mcs tracking fishing vessels and strengthening the traceability of fish caught are important aspects regular stock assessment of major commercial fishes and adoption of ecosystem approach to fisheries management eafm principles and application ai in marine fisheries data collection are necessary to monitor and devise strategic management of fish wealth likewise measures to explore the potential of hitherto commercially unexploited species including deepsea resources need to be taken up indias deepsea harvestable potential depths between 200 and 2000 meters in both eezs and areas beyond national jurisdiction abnj is estimated to be over 33 mt this mainly includes the oceanic tuna nonconventional deepsea resources such as mesopelagic myctophids giant purpleback squid and other species in the indian ocean that can be harnessed through technological advancements and greater capital investments impact assessments and evaluations of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies must be founded on extensive assessments of risks and opportunities benefits and costs as well as on modelling approaches that incorporate data from a variety of sources special emphasis should be placed on changes in the phenology of major fish species temperature tolerance the impact of algal blooms and their relationship to fisheries the appearance and spread of invasive species and the vulnerabilities of reef and other delicate marine and freshwater ecosystems climate change adaptation strategies must also be incorporated into the fisheries regulations as well as capacity building and awareness campaigns into action plans the large gap between potential and actual fish yields from culturebased fisheries resources like rivers reservoirs and wetlands provides plenty of room for fisheries improvement largescale cage and pen culture in reservoirs for raising proper stocking material wider reservoir coverage for stocking advanced fingerlings and using remote sensing and gis indian agriculture after independence 204technologies to create appropriate databases required for the formulation of appropriate management norms and ensuring environmental flows for riverine systems are all necessary for the sustainability of inland fisheries and biodiversity conservation in the aquaculture sector there is a need for the development of breeding and seed rearing protocols for new candidate species including the development of broodstock multiplication centres bmc and nuclear multiplication centres nmc sustainable intensification nursery integration development of suitable feeds for complete life cycle and costeffective inputs and surveillance and disease predictability modern highinput farming practices viz ras biofloc aibased smart farming etc offer considerable scope to boost aquaculture production and therefore need special rd focus the programmes on selective breeding in important fishshellfish species for traits such as growth and disease resistance need a special thrust development of costeffective functional feeds using amino acid balancing and nutrigenomics tailormade costeffective feeds and live feeds are essential to utilize the production potential of the existing and new candidate species comprehensive disease control and health management programmes on existing and emerging diseases surveillance biosecurity and packages for fish health management are essential to keep pace with the emerging needs of the aquaculture domain the genetic and biotechnological interventions including genetic manipulation by crispr cas9 has immense potential in improving the commercial traits of ornamental and food fishes bioprospecting for the development of nutraceuticals and cosmetics from marine flora and fauna bioremediation and biomonitoring for ensuring sustainable production environments are other areas of importance recent research developments indicate the possibility of exploring in vitro techniques for fish meat production intensification of mariculture is another promising option to meet the growing seafood demand research breakthroughs in the areas of captive breeding and mass production of some prioritized highvalue marine fish species along with success in open sea cage farming in coastal waters have opened new vistas for enhancing marine fish production however it is important to identify and characterize suitable areas for mariculture formulate suitable leasing policies for sea farming in large cages 30 m dia develop quality seed and feed production facilities and strengthen value chains similarly massive amounts of data accumulated during the aquaculture process could be digitized or appropriate ways devised to use them as inputs to decisionmaking processes mass culture of marine microalgae as a vegetarian source of pufa for human consumption and extraction of fish oil valuable nutraceuticals and bioactive molecules have immense potential seaweed cultivation in india is being undertaken in nearshore waters and to overcome inshore challenges its expansion to offshore areas is a suitable option in the vegetative propagation of seaweed a large amount of harvested material needs to be used during the seeding process large scale use of the available technique of micropropagation in vitro clonal propagation can only meet the demand for seed material for the future expansion of seaweed farming important priority areas in the postharvest sector are bringing out better designs of new generation fuelefficient and multipurpose green fishing vessels and gears thrust on achievements in fisheries and aquaculture in independent india 205the deepsea and distant water fishing with facilities of onboard handling preservation packaging and quality control development of valueadded products addressing issues related to food safety and value addition of discards 4 conclusion the fishing and aquaculture sectors in india have shown steady growth in the past few decades which further aims to improve through continued rd backing local support networks for capture and aquaculture production value chain development and marketing motorization and mechanization of fishing boats as well as parallel advancements in craft and gear technology and navigation considerably aided in the rise in productivity of marine capture fisheries marine fisheries production in the country has stagnated and many concerns demand rapid attention the primary one being management efforts aiming at sustainability due to the saturation of conventional fishing grounds any increase in marine output should come from offshore fisheries which require improved technology management and infrastructure climate change research their effect and current mitigation strategies should be assessed and appropriate technologiesinterventions based on forecasts should be deployed and changed as needed there is enormous potential for expanding fish output from reservoirs and both traditional and contemporary farming methods such as cage culture might be used to do so gisbased inland water resource mapping is crucial for identifying and planning the optimal locations for culture or other fisheriesrelated activities in the aquaculture sector the achievements in induced breeding seed production and culture procedures aided to production basket enormously greater thrust on diversification aimed at bringing highvalue new candidate species and production systems with greater water and energy use efficiency is expected to boost the farming in all three sectors ie in freshwater brackishwater and marine waters frontier research fields such as selective breeding genomic section genetic engineering cryopreservation surrogate fish development and bioprospecting have sparked a considerable interest to increase production output with changing climatic circumstances it is necessary to produce strains with high thermal tolerance that can survive in a broad range of water temperatures the development of breeding methods for native ornamental fishes has enormous promise effective disease diagnosis and control measures are becoming more critical in culture operations because of increased stocking numbers and changing climatic conditions priority should be given to developing vaccines to prevent disease as well as treatments and chemicals that have the least adverse effects on the environment more emphasis is needed on postharvest value addition to create highvalue products besides effective utilization of lowvalue species or fish waste though numerous technologies have been developed across diverse domains for greater adoption at the ground level better integration of technologies as well as collaboration with other organizations and departments are essential finally fish is becoming important as a health food and therefore ensuring quality and safe fish production is of foremost priority indian agriculture after

institute new delhi 4icarcentral research institute for jute and allied fibres barrackpore west bengal summary in the post green revolution the pest scenario of crops has undergone drastic change the pest problems in terms of number of species frequency of outbreaks and entry of invasive species have intensified various efforts on pest management have achieved varying extent of impact leading to food security to the nation the pest management which was chemical centric initially moved towards ecofriendly integrated pest management with an optimum substitute of chemicals by blend of nonchemical measures location specific ipm strategies for field commercial vegetable and fruit crops were developed validated and disseminated with proven economic and ecological benefits implementation of ictbased epest surveillance and digital dissemination of advisories across different states facilitated adoption of scientific pest management by the farming community the rd set up and plant protection industries have all paraphernalia needed for an effective preparedness and management of pest while past has been glorious with some pathbreaking achievements the future challenges are rather formidable in view of changes in cropping systems and climate change which have escalated the dynamism in pest infestation with higher risks it requires a converged functioning of plant protection stakeholders the quarantine and pest surveillance needs networking international cooperation artificial intelligence diagnosis and data analytics the biocontrol agents are the potential tool for pest management for which the entrepreneurial capacity in farm women rural youth and agrigraduates needs to be developed for their mass production the major development in plant protection has been described in this chapter 1 introduction crop pests include weeds insects rodents nematodes and pathogens fungal oomycete bacterial viral and mycoplasmas the use of the pesticides has been one of the major strategies to reduce the damages caused by these pests in india the insecticides use is 44 followed by herbicides 22 despite the extensive worldwide use of pesticides there are massive losses to pests oerke 2006 a recent global level study on crop losses in the main indian agriculture after independence 210food security hotspots including the indogangetic plains for five major crops showed significant losses by pests weeds excluded that ranged from 101281 for wheat 246 404 for rice 195411 for maize 8121 for potato and 11324 for soybean savary et al 2019 losses could be due to either warmer climate and or lack of access to more effective pesticides it is projected that losses to insect pests and pathogens will increase with global warming deutsch et al 2018 velasquez et al 2018 the arms race between the pests and the hosts is real this should be clear to everyone after the covid19 pandemic pests can be dealt with either by pesticides or by genetic means by mobilizing resistanceconferring genes from the landraces or the wild relatives of the crop by crossing and in case of more distantly related species by genetic engineering technologies during the last 75 years many milestones have been achieved in managing the pests and diseases in crop plants and sustaining the food and nutritional security of the country 2 plant pathology 21 enriching collection and conservation of plant pathogen culturesdisease specimen herbarium cryptogamae india orientalis hcio is a national herbarium established by sir edwin john butler at pusa bihar in 1905 which was shifted to indian agricultural research institute in 1934 nearly 50000 fungal diseased specimens of different groups of fungi preserved in hcio 2000 genera and more than 3000 type specimens so far 570 new species and 19 genera were described to the science from hcio indian type culture collection itcc was established in 1936 in the then division of mycology and plant pathology indian agricultural research institute new delhi with a view to furnish a knowledge on living fungi about 4000 fungal and 600 bacterial cultures are maintained at itcc which includes plant pathogens biocontrol agents fungi for medical and industrial use including mushrooms and yeasts itcc is an affiliate member of the world federation for culture collections wfcc and is registered with the world data centre for microorganisms wdcm registration number 430 central insecticide board directorate of plant protection quarantine storage ministry of agriculture government of india had made it

diagnostics for major pathogens highly reliable and sensitive pcr based diagnostics have been developed for several major fungal bacterial viral and phytoplasma disease causing agents dna barcodes have been developed for several plant pathogens including multiplex pcr and qpcr assay for diagnosis of pathogens infecting pulse crops to facilitate safe exchange and healthy conservation of germplasm diagnostics were also developed for several viral diseases of national importance using coat protein for simultaneous detection of several viruses as cucumber mosaic virus papaya ring spot virus and groundnut bud necrosis virus one step lateral flow assay has been developed for onfarm detection and identification for four viruses viz large cardamom chirke virus cardamom bushy dwarf virus potato virus y and papaya ring spot virus multiplex pcr was standardized for detection of six rna viruses infecting potato namely pvx pvy pvs pvm plrv and pv a multiplex pcr was also standardized for the detection of poty carla and alexi viruses in garlic a microarray has been developed for detection of plant viruses and viroids for which sequences were available several viruses and viroids were detected using this chip from different crops such as grapevine chilli tomato and sugarcane 23 epidemiology of major plant diseases on the basis of a series of epidemiological investigations by wheat researchers the stem rust rules were formulated using climatic data which explained the nature and recurrence of puccinia graminis tritici and p triticina these rules suggested that the urediniospores originating from the nilgiris spread to central india under the influence of tropical cyclone that occurs in the bay of bengal during november based on this a disease management strategy was formulated and implemented to contain crop losses on a similar basis the nature and recurrence of the leaf rust p triticina and the stripe rust p striiformis over the indogangetic plains gene matching techniques developed helped in postulating the resistance genes in the variety before its official release the work on late blight forecasting in india started in 1950s when chaudhuri and pal 1959 utilized the rainfall data and dates of appearance of late blight in darjeeling hills for 12 years a computerized forecasting model jhulsacast for western uttar pradesh which has 3 important components late blight prediction model a computer programme for forecasting and an interface to utilize weather data from an automatic weather station recently jhulsacast model was implemented in western uttar pradesh using wireless sensor networks wsn to forecast late blight and the model could forecast the disease well in advance in comparison to other forecasting models tested indoblightcast a webbased pan india model has been developed for forecasting potato late blight across the country singh et al 2016 the advantages of indoblight cast model are that it predicts late blight appearance using daily mean temperature and rh data available with meteorological stations and is an improvement over jhulsacast the model is being used to forecast appearance of late blight across agroecologies and accordingly agroadvisories are being issued to respective regions using electronic and print media thereby containing the losses indian agriculture after independence 212caused by late blight by forewarning the farmers and reducing fungicide load by applying fungicides judiciously computer based forecasting system has also been developed for rice blast grape downy mildew karnal bunt of wheat apple scab marssonina blotch and many important plant diseases in india 24 biological control biological control has become an alternative strategy for the control of diseases insectpests and weeds to reduce the excessive use of agrochemicals and its health hazards the list of biocontrol agents included in central insecticides board cib for registration are bacillus subtilis pseudomonas fluorescens gliocladium spp trichoderma spp beauvaria bassiana metarrhizium anisopliae verticillum lecanii granulosis viruses nuclear polyhedrosis viruses npv nomurea rileyi hirsutella species verticillium chlamydosporium streptomyces griseoviridis streptomyces lydicus ampelomyces quisqualis candida oleophila fusarium oxysporum nonpathogenic

marcescens gps 5 and piriformospora indica etc however the market share of the microorganisms is very low and currently biopesticides occupy about 4 of the total pesticide market share in india for increasing the use of biocontrol agents by farmers the identified bottlenecks related to quality needs to be overcome them trichoderma harzianum based bioformulation pusa 5 sd and chaetomium globosum based bioformulated product have been developed and proved effective against several plant pathogens 25 biopesticides pgprs and novel molecules biopesticide formulation based on bacteria fungi viruses nematodes protozoa etc are microbial pesticides used for biological control of plant diseases nine microbes namely bacillus subtilis gliocladium spp trichoderma spp pseudomonas fluorescens beauvaria bassiana metarrhizium anisopliae verticillium lecanii granulosis viruses and nuclear polyhedral viruses npv have been included in a schedule vide as an amendment in insecticides act 1968 for the commercial production of biopesticide and published in the gazette of india dated 26th march 1999 to date 26 more microbes have been included in the schedule to the insecticide act 1968 for production of microbial biopesticides icar has documented information of 31 biopesticides developed by its institutions and are at various stages of registration and commercialization saxena et al 2021 many pgprs viz azotobacter azospirillum alcaligenes arthrobacter bacillus enterobacter burkholderia klebsiella pseudomonas and serratia have been reported to control several diseases and enhance plant growth pseudomonas and bacillus are the two bacterial genera that are well documented for their antagonistic as well as isr activity against several plant pathogens a nanocopper based formulation developed achievements in crop protection in independent india 213as an alternative costeffective management option for major bacterial diseases of crop plants 26 deciphered molecular basis of pathogenesis in different hostpathogen systems type 3 secretion system t3ss effectors are required by the pathogenic bacteria for their growth virulence and colonization in host plant the function of t3ss effectors during bacterial blight development in rice and pomegranate by xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae xoo and xanthomonas axonopodis pv punicae xap respectively has been demonstrated mondal et al 2020 the role of the effectors on disease development was verified in several host pathogen system including xap and pomegranate kumar et al 2016 a new rice blast magnaporthe oryzae resistance gene pikh pi54 from a unique source was identified mapped which provides resistance to major isolates of m oryzae this gene activates complex defense mechanism as demonstrated by using microarray analysis new alleles pi54rh and pi54of were mined from wild rice species which are resistant to the blast fungus robust dna makers tightly linked to pi54 gene were developed which are being used extensively in india to improve rice varieties a novel qtl qsbr111 for sheath blight resistance in rice which has been transferred to basmati type varieties by the rice breeders during 2021 a new leaf rust resistance gene lr80 was identified and closely linked markers were developed for its successful pyramiding with other markertagged genes to achieve durable control of leaf rust 27 genome of the plant pathogens unravelled plants immune system seems to be evolved from simpler to more complex system keeping in pace with the evolution in the pathogens pathogen equally has modified in such a way to break the barriers of plant immune system this necessitates to understand the genomic features of major plant pathogens in this context genomic database of several important plant pathogens have been unravelled like puccinia graminis f sp trtici p striiformis f sp tritici p triticina tilletia indica magnaporthe grisea and x oryzae pv oryzae these data base would help in understanding the pathogen more appropriately and thereby would lead to novel management options the big challenge now is to make effective utilization of the enormous sequence data that is available 3 insect pest insects are economically productive as well as destructive depending upon their behaviorbeneficial or damaging to agriculturalhorticultural crops and threats to food production causing food security nutrition and livelihood support concerns of mankind these also work as potential vectors for transmitting of diseasecausing pathogens to humans and animals despite the annual investment of us 40 billion for the application of 3 of pesticides and various biological and other nonchemical control worldwide global crop losses remain a matter of concern pimentel and peshin 2014 the attractive option to boost the food and nonfood crop production include among others growing of improved indian agriculture after independence 214crop cultivars and better crop and pest management the perils of insect pests to crop production and the strategies of their management adopted postindependence are briefly discussed herewith 31 insect collection and conservation the national insect museum of icarnational bureau of

pigeon pea groundnut and tomato insects and diseases are available as mobile apps climatic variability in terms of monsoon rainfall influence rice bph population and more than 30 rainy days during june to september months resulted in the pest outbreaks with 75 probability chander and husain 2018 likewise pestweather models in combination with historical weather and with the help of gis have been used for delineation of pest hotspots for rice bph through agroecological pest zoning thereby facilitating strategic pest management planning yadav et al 2010 infocrop a generic crop growth simulation model for tropical environments has been developed and coupled with different pest damage mechanisms the mechanistic pest population simulation models based on thermal constant concept and biotic and abiotic mortality factors were developed for rice pests reji and chander 2008 further these models were coupled to the infocrop model and the coupled model could be used to analyse impact of indian agriculture after independence 216climate change on pest dynamics as well as croppest interactions selvaraj and chander 2015 34 development of pest management techniques 341 host plant resistance one of the fundamental pillars of pest management is host plant resistance hpr the germplasm has been screened and exploited for development of varieties and hybrids in different crops commercialization of bt transgenic hybrids since 2002 followed by bollgardii double gene technology in 2006 has been a standalone hpr attempt against bollworms of cotton and it brought down insecticide usage by 69 some of the important resistant cultivars include cose 01421 imarti of sugarcane in north central zone against red rot shoot borer top borer and stalk borer js 9305 of soybean tolerant to insect pests and drought in madhya pradesh maharashtra rajasthan and karnataka and cashew variety bhaskara less prone to the attack of tea mosquito bug in coastal karnataka 342 cultural

with tomato against fruit borer helicoverpa armigera and napier grass and napier millet as trap crops against stem borer chilo partellus in maize and sorghum are some outstanding examples advanced insect light trap technology viz light trap safer to beneficial insects for mass trapping of selective phototrophic macrolepidopteran insect pests has been developed that facilitates escape of beneficial insects and nontargeted insect fauna through a porous filter chamber singh 2015 this technology in being used by different organizations in various states of the country 343 semio chemicals sex pheromones are routinely used for monitoring and mass trapping for species of insects viz helicoverpa armigera spodoptera litura pectinophora gossypiella tuta absoluta aproaerema modicella and s frugiperda similarly species specific pheromones for rice yellow stem borer borers of sugarcane diamond back moth of cabbage white grubs of sugar cane rhinoceros beetle and red palm weevil of coconut are deployed in various cropping systems pheromones are also used for mating disruption with delivery mechanism such as traps or ropes or specialized pheromone and lure application technology splat formulation against p gossyiella in bt cotton ecosystem 344 biological pest suppression besides several outstanding successes in respect of suppression of invasive species with imported natural enemies as discussed earlier in this section many obnoxious insect pests have been managed with indigenous natural enemies epiricania melanoleuca a parasitoid achievements in crop protection in independent india 217of pyrilla perpusilla introduced into gujarat in 1982 from maharashtra and haryana on sugarcane has been suppressing the pest since then with 72 parasitism likewise the ichneumonid isotima javensis a parasitoid of sugarcane top borer scirpophaga excerptalis in northern india has been successfully colonized in south india recently several native hymenopteran parasitoids and pentatomid bug predators viz eocanthecona furcellata and andrallus spinidens in maize ecosystem exhibited scope of natural bio control of fall armyworm faw mass production protocols have been developed for predators parasitoids and pathogens multiple insecticide and high temperature tolerant strains of the egg parasitoid trichogramma chilonis pesticide tolerant strain of predatory chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi formulations of entomopathogenic nematode heterorhabditis indica for the biological control of white grubs and other soil insects and indigenous bacillus thuringiensis liquid formulations against many lepidopteran crop pests have been the technologies promoted for agribusiness in biocontrol since discovery of antifeedant activity of neem seed kernel extract against desert locust significant progress has been made in research and development of azadirachtin based biopesticides 345 chemical pesticides the chemical control has seen many generations of insecticides while first generation pesticides were inorganics second generation included ddt and bhc and organophosphates and carbamates on which the crop protection relied heavily 1950 onwards with other management interventions almost subdued presently in india safer organophosphates and pyrethroids have been registered and they are being used by the farmers the overuse of pesticides resulted in problem of resistance development in insects first reported in the country in singhara beetle galerucella birmanica in 1963 pradhan et al 1963 the non lethal methods such as attractants repellants antifeedants chemosterilants pheromones and insect hormones constituted the thirdgeneration pesticides while mid 1970s witnessed the introduction of synthetic pyrethroids as fourth generation pesticides these were followed by new molecules with novel mode of action such as neonicotinoids spinosad spinosyn a and spinosyn b and avermectins the latter two often referred as bio rational insecticides a total of 299 pesticides have been registered in india as on july 2021 methyl bromide as fumigant has been used for more than six decades to disinfect imported commodities and in storage dppqs 2017 following the montreal protocol phase out schedule india has worked on aluminum phosphide as an alternative to methyl bromide as pesticides have not been registered against pests on all crops farmers often use offlabel products that have implications on food safety and export grouping of crops and commodities 554 numbers in line with the codex classification and guidelines for label expansion with respect to maximum residue limits mrl has been a step forward by the government draft notification of 2020 on ban of 27 pesticides including 12 insecticides is still under review by dacfw the pesticide management bill 2020 emphasizes on adopting systematic standard operating procedures with transparency with optimization of benefits between the industries and growers mediated by the government indian agriculture after independence 21835 evolution of integrated pest management pest control during subsistence phase prior to green revolution was through natural factors and insecticide use was rare prophylactic treatments and indiscriminate use of synthetic insecticides during exploitation phase 196070 led to the development of resistance in pests and secondary pest outbreaks that created a crisis situation for pest control during 1980s disaster phase coincided with collapse of management programmes especially in cotton and despite increased insecticide usage and rising the cost of production there were crop failures trapping farmers in debt the concept of integrated control in india was propounded by dr s pradhan in 1969 pest management at field level in india was initiated in 1975 with introduction of operational research programme orp on cotton and rice india became member of faocountry programme in 1980s and adopted ipm as a national policy in 1985 the faointer country programme was started in rice during 1993 simultaneously with ipm programme in cotton by cabi biointensive ipm bipm is being promoted for a sustainable insect pest management

ecosystem in the country classical biological control appears to be an important approach in the management of these invasive species international collaboration for the management of invasive species indian agriculture after independence 220is of utmost importance as exchange of resources can help in timely control of the pest in the recent years several invasive insects are managed through classical biological control by introduction of natural enemies from home range the quarantine facility at nbair set up in the year 2009 as a fully equipped quarantine block as per the international standards since then several natural enemies have been imported such as acerophagus papayae for the management of papaya mealybug quadrastichus mendeli for the management of eucalyptus gall wasp recently the encyrtid wasp anagyrus lopezi was imported from benin for the management of the cassava meal bug 4 nematology nematodes are one amongst the various biotic factors that cause stress to plants approximately 40 of food crops are lost to agricultural pests including plant nematodes fao 2019 damage caused by plant parasitic nematodes ppns has been estimated between us 80 billion nicol et al 2011 to us 157 billion per year abad et al 2008 however the extent of nematode damage is expected to be far more as most of the farmers predominantly in developing countries are oblivious of the presence of ppns jones et al 2013 nematology as a scientific discipline was possibly the last of the plant protection disciplines to get recognition only in mid to late 19 th century although nematological investigations date back to the days of aristotle chitwood and chitwood 1950 chen et al 2004 scientific attention eluded ppns because of i their microscopic size ii below ground habitat in soilroots iii nonspecific symptoms except in few cases like rootknots or ear cockle of wheat iv techniques of extraction were not known till early twentieth century v difficulty in proving their pathogenicity as they are obligate parasites and cannot be cultured on artificial media vi lack of trained human resource and vii unawareness among the farmers the earliest mention to nematodes krimi or krmin can be traced to rig yajur and atharva vedas written in 60004000 bc charak is supposed to have recognized 20 different organsims as krimis in his samhita which included nematodes besides arthropods and leeches the first allusion to a ppn is however preserved in the famous writ sowed cockle reapd no corn a line by william shakespeare penned in 1594 in loves labours lost act iv scene 3 most certainly has reference to blighted wheat caused by the plant parasite anguina tritici thorne 1961 needham 1743 cracked the riddle of cockle when he crushed one of the diseased wheat grains and observed the earcockle nematode anguina tritici in the following years till early 1900s the descriptive reportage of nematodes and their taxonomy is mostly documented contributions of n a cobb in america laid the foundation of the discipline nematology in preindependent india the first report of plant parasitic nematode was by barber of the rootknot nematode on tea from devala estate tamil nadu in 1901 later same nematode was reported on black pepper in 1906 by butler from kerala these two reports indicate achievements in crop protection in independent india 221the trade interests of the colonial power the first report of indians documenting economic importance of the rootknot nematodes in south india is by ayyar in the year 1926 dastur in 1936 reported occurrence of the white tip disease of rice by aphelenchoides besseyi the major handicap in this time period was nonavailability of trained human resource in nematology 41 assessment and management of nematodes in order to generate location specific nematode management technologies or practices for different agroclimatic conditions plant nematode pests and their control was initiated in 1977 by the department of science and technology govt of india the critical analysis of data generated through aicrp on nematodes over the years revealed 213 crop losses amounting to rs 102039 million annually in india due to plant parasitic nematodes which included rs 50224 million in 19 horticultural crops and rs 51814 million in 11 field crops rice root knot nematode meloidogyne graminicola was found the potent upcoming nematode problem of rice with economic loss of about rs 2327232 million citrus rs 9828 million banana rs 9710 million among fruit crops and tomato rs 6035 million brinjal rs 3499 million and okra rs 2480 million among the vegetable crops suffered comparatively more losses walia et al 2018 regionspecific package of practices for nematode management in cereal vegetable horticultural fibre oilseed pulses spices and plantation crops have been released under aicrp on nematodes walia and chakrabarty 2018 42 nematode management by biopesticides icarindian institute of horticultural research

sustainable management option for insects pusa nemagel a biopesticidal formulation based on heat tolerant indigenous insect parasitic nematode species steinernema abbasi with improved viability and shelf life of the nematode for the management of soil arthropods has also been developed novel indian agriculture after independence 222insecticidal wp formulations of heterorhabditis indica for the biological control of white grubs and other soil insect pests have also been developed by icarnational bureau of agricultural insect resources bengaluru nagesh et al 2019b icar sugarcane breeding institute coimbatore tamil nadu have developed epn formulations containing heterorhabditis indica and steinernema glaseri with considerable product shelf life icar iari has also developed an apparatus for in vivo mass production of entomopathogenic nematode and an indian patent has already been granted to it small entrepreneurs can use these technologies to establish epn production units and earn profit 44 basic research in nematology division of nematology at the icariari is one of the best centres of nematology research and teaching the national nematode collection of india is also housed in the division there are 2595 type slides 611 type species 3302 wet collections and 2285 identified slides apart from epn technologies the division is identified for international level of basic research in nematology it has identified rnai target genes relating to parasitism neuro muscular system structural component and reproductive system genes etc of ppns a us patent has been granted for a host delivered doublestranded rna ds rna mediated gene silencing of root knot nematodes for the control of nematodes in plants patents for nematode induced promoter sequences expressing i only in roots and the ii other in only rootknot nematicide induced galls have also been filed 45 eradication of earcockle disease of wheat anguina tritici the first plant parasitic nematode described in 1743 causes the earcockle disease in wheat wrinkled and twisted leaves of young plants reduced and irregular heads ears having the typical cockles light to dark brown round galls instead of healthy grains are the main symptoms of the disease the earcockle and tundu disease causal organisms a tritici corynebacter tritici have been eradicated completely from punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh and from most parts of rajasthan eastern up madhya pradesh and bihar 46 policy decisions impacting nematology the discovery of golden nematode globodera rostochiensis of potato in the nilgiri hills of tamil nadu in 1961 ushered in the era of applied nematology in india it was traced that this dreaded nematode had been introduced into india along with seed potatoes imported from europe immediately after its detection in india and going by the european experience a policy decision to enforce domestic quarantine against this nematode was taken in 1971 to check its further spread within the country however the nematode was intercepted from northern hilly areas of himachal pradesh uttarakhand and jammu kashmir in recent years the provision of domestic quarantine was further extended to these states in 2018 this notification will restrict any further spread of this nematode in the potato cultivation area of the northern plains achievements in crop protection in independent india 223in consideration of the economic losses attributed to the plant parasitic nematodes in agricultural crops the ministry of agriculture govt of india accorded priority registration to two new chemical molecules fluopyram and fluensulfone in 2018 as exclusive nematicides these are considered relatively safe to the environment and will replace the currently used highly toxic carbamate and organophosphatic nematicides for the first time a fungal bioagent paecilomyces lilacinus has also been granted regular registration in 2018 5 weed research among various biotic factors that limit production weeds cause highest yield loss of 33 dwr 2015 in india total economic losses due to weeds in 10 major field crops in 18 states are us 11 billion annually gharde et al 2018 very high economic losses were estimated in rice us 4420 million wheat us 3376 million and soybean us 1559 million weeds compete with crops for inputsresources decrease quantity and quality of produce and cause health hazards for humans and animals hence managing weeds is pre requisite for attaining higher crop productivity profitability and improved resourcesinput use efficiency amongst the various methods of weed management herbicide is proven easier to apply most efficient and costeffective tool the milestones and impacts in weed research and management technologies during the last 75 years of independence of india are presented in following section 51 weed survey and ecology research research on weed surveydistribution across cropscropping systems and biology and ecology have been recurrent one that continues over times there were focusses on ecology and life cycle of predominant weeds to determine the weakest phase in the life cycle when weeds could be easily controlled estimation of yield losses due to weeds determining critical period of weed competition in major crops as early as 19641969 a pl 480 research project with usaid was undertaken on the ecology of ten common noxious weeds that included chenopodium album cyperus rotundus eichhornia crassipes anagallis arvensis spirodela polyrrhiza portulaca oleracea cassia tora eleusine indica amaranthus spinosus and eleocharis palustris during 1990s studies also embraced upon physiology biology and ecology of some important perennial annual weeds namely eupatorium adenophorum riparium odoratum cyperus rotundus oxalis latifolia echinochloa colona glabrescens and weed seed bank dynamics in ricewheat cropping system and comparative ecophysiology of phalaris minor and avena ludoviciana dur and wheat the ecology of problematic weeds parthenium hysterophorus was assessed and its chemical and biological control measures was developed parthenium awareness week paw was initiated in 2005 and is being organized every year thereafter a weed atlas for major weeds in major crops in 435 districts spread across 19 states of the country was published dixit et al 2008 826 weed species were reported to cause yield losses in india of which 80 and 198 were indian agriculture after independence 224considered very serious and serious weeds respectively economic threshold level etl of trianthema portulacastrum l hazra et al 2011 and cyperus rotundus l das et al 2014 in soybean and chenopodium album l dodamani and das 2013 phalaris minor retz raj et al 2020 and avena sterilis ssp ludoviciana

phenoxyalkanoic acids in 1940s carbamates thiocarbamates in 1950s 1954 onwards phenylureas in 1950s 1951 onwards dinitroanilines in 1950s 1955 onwards acetamides in 1950s 1956 onwards triazines symmetrical triazines in 1950s 1956 onwards uracils in 1960s 1962 onwards aryloxyphenoxypropionates apps in 1970s mainly in the late 1970s and early 1980s imidazolinones in the 197080s sulfonylureas in 1980s were developedreported in the world candidate herbicides of these respective groups were commercially used contemporarily to these years or later initially nonselective inorganic herbicides like sodium chlorate naclo 3 were used in the world and to a limited scale in india for weed control in bunds roadsides and noncrop situations then came several selective herbicides for weed control in cropped situations these herbicides were used in higher doses usually in kgha like triazines atrazine simazine propazine cynazine ametryn prometryn etc dinitroanilines pendimethalin fluchloralin trifluralin etc phenylureas diuron linuron isoproturon chlortoluron etc phenoxyalkanoic acids 24d mcpa etc recently there has been a tremendous shift in herbicide molecules called novel herbicides having specific mode of action they include imidazolinones imazamethabenz imazapyr imazaquin imazethapyr imazamox sulfonylureas h alosulfuronmethyl pyrazosulfuronethyl nicosulfuron flazasulfuron sulfosulfuron c hlorimuronethyl bensulfuronmeth yl primisulfuronmethyl sulfometuronmethyl c hlorsulfuron metsulfuronmethyl triasulfuron tribenuronmethyl pyrimidinylthiobenzoates pyrithiobacna bispyribac na pyriminobacmethyl triazolopyrimidines penoxsulam pyroxsulam flumetsulam cloransulammethyl diclosulam metosulam which are recommended at lower doses have high potency and lower residual toxicity 53 integrated weed management cultural and mechanical practices were evaluated and included into the packages of integrated weed management programmes das et al 2012 the utilization of weeds such as lantana camara eupatorium odoratum parthenium hysterophorus eichhornia crassipes for compostgreen manuresoil mulch in several crops and cropping systems was explored integrated weed management practices were also developed for several crops across regions soil solarization using blacktransparent polyethene 25100 thickness for weed management was developed das and yaduraju 2008 and was recommended achievements in crop protection in independent india 225for reducing soil seed bank soil solarization combined with herbicides metolachlor glyphosate imazethapyr as applicable were recommended for crops and cropping systems for better weed control including cyperus rotundus kumar et al 2012 recently many machineoperated weeders are available for use by farmers in india brown manuring technology with sesbania aculeata or mixture of sesbania aculeata and crotalaria juncea was developed for directseeded rice and maize crops das et al 2019 additionally several innovative practices like band application stale seedbed and novel combinations of dormancy breakers like kno3 or ga3 and herbicides were developed das and das 2018 integrated weed management schedules for major crops and cropping systems including the management of deadly weed parthenium hysterophorus noxious weed cyperus rotundus and resistantcrossresistant phalaris minor were also developed 54 management of phalaris minor resistance continuous use of isoproturon for 1015 years in wheat under ricewheat system led to evolution of resistant phalaris minor populationsbiotypes the resistance against isoproturon was established in 1992 malik and singh 1995 it posed severe threat to wheat production in india and required 811 times more dose of isoproturon than that required for susceptible biotypes to achieve 50 growth reduction gr 50 in resistant populations of this weed it is considered as the most serious case of herbicide resistance in the world the resistance spread in more than 10 million ha of ricewheat cropping system based on a joint recommendation of icariari and sauspau and ccshau the government of india gave provisional registration to clodinafoppropargyl sulfosulfuron and fenoxaproppethyl in 199798 for use as alternative herbicides to control isoproturonresistant phalaris minor icar iari ccshau and pau and manufacturing companies and several farmers groups jointly created awareness about the resistance and its management which proved successful integrated weed management iwm modules involving alternative herbicides cultural and other agronomic practices for controlling p minor was suggested in recent years use of biotechnology tools for understanding molecular diversity of phalaris minor populations in wheat and mechanism of resistance of phalaris minor to isoproturon were initiated after continuous use of clodinafoppropargyl fenoxapropp ethyl diclofopmethyl and sulfosulfuron for 67 years evolution of crossresistance in p minor against these herbicides was reported during early 2000s p minor developed multiple resistance to many herbicides in recent years das et al 2014 pinoxaden mesosulfuron iodosulfuron readymix and sulfosulfuron metsulfuron readymix were recommended for the control of resistant p minor populations in wheat chhokar and sharma 2008 continuous refinement of weed management technologies is essential to cut down production costs and also in the light of everchanging socioeconomic conditions of the farmers and international trade policies herbicides are going to become increasingly popular in the coming years but the residue hazards and other environmental issues are also required to be suitably addressed development of suitable technologies to tackle the indian agriculture after independence 226probable scenario that may emerge in the area of cropweed competition due to increasing atmospheric co2 concentration and subsequent global warming are some of the major future challenges herbicidetolerant crops may be a possibility in indian agriculture as an important component of integrated weed management in near future 6 plant quarantine for plant genetic resources international exchange of plantsplanting material carries an inadvertent risk of introduction of exotic pests or their new virulent racesstrains into new areas history has witnessed several examples of dangerous pests introduced along with plantsplanting materialplant products that have led to serious socioeconomic consequences plant quarantine is a mandatory requirement to regulate the entry of seedplanting material plant products living organisms and soil etc so as to prevent unintended entry of pests across nations international exchange of plant genetic resources pgr is important to broaden the genetic base of crops in order to develop improved crop varieties in india there are two routes for entry of plants or their parts first is the bulk import for commercial use and consumption is being monitored by directorate of plant protection quarantine and storage dppqs faridabad and the second route is for small seed samples for research purposes though larger in number which are being imported through icarnational bureau of plant genetic resources nbpgr at new delhi since its establishment in 1976 the government of india has legislated the plant quarantine regulation of import into india order in 2003 to regulate the import of plant material under this order icarnational bureau of plant genetic resources icarnbpgr has been delegated powers to issue import permit and to carry out quarantine processing of imported pgr including transgenics and for issue of phytosanitary certificate for pgr meant for export the division of plant quarantine at icarnbpgr new delhi has developed an efficient and systematic protocol for quarantine processing for pest diagnostics salvaging and containment to ensure biosecurity during exchange of pgr and to be transparent during exchange internationally stringent quarantine examination of 4997795 samples of pgr during 19762021 of which 178507 samples were found infested infected by insects 108615 pathogens 42123 nematodes 23952 and weeds 3817 a total of 78 exotic pests including insects mites 26 fungi 6 viruses 19 nematodes 9 and weeds 18 that are not yet reported from india were intercepted a systematic stepwise strategy is being followed for testing of each of the samples imported for presence of any unwanted pests all the samples found infestedinfected with pests viz were salvaged using suitable methods and if they could not be salvaged they were rejected and destroyed by appropriate means had any of these exotic pests not been intercepted and had escaped they could have entered and established in the country and subsequently caused devastation to our agriculture presently exchange of pgr has become more difficult under the convention on biological diversity hence all attempts were made to salvage the germplasm and over 99 of samples were salvaged and less than 1 samples were rejected efforts are needed in the national plant quarantine system to develop and use the latest detection and ecoachievements in crop protection in independent india 227friendly disinfestation disinfection techniques to minimalize the risk of pest escape in quarantine the 78 pests of quarantine significance for india mentioned previously if not quarantined had the potential to cause serious economic losses to the country as these do in the host countries favourable environmental conditions do exist in india for all the 78 pests a simple calculation assuming just eight pests of four major crops viz wheat soybean cotton and maize causing 10 economic loss would amount to more than rs 300 crore annually to farmers these losses in fact would be much higher in real life situation and a just 10 loss will amount to rs 3000 crores per annum based on minimum support price 20192020 and yield of 20182019 these pests once established cannot be eliminated hence would cause recurring losses 7 conclusion the present compilation on the technologies of plant protection in independent india depicted a holistic picture of the major researches and development of useful techniques that helped the farmersstakeholders to protect the crops from avoidable losses pest and disease management is an evolving system approach that accommodates all needbased innovations concepts and policies in regard to various management practices the innovations in bio and nanotechnologies and ict have taken advantage for improving effectives of ipm programmes and their dissemination the judicious use of pesticides needs to be ascertained to produce safe and quality food prevent environmental contamination promote exports and reduce cost of production thereby increasing farmer income increasing concern for safer chemicals led to priority registration and use of safer new generation chemicals likewise conservation and enhancement of natural bioagents for pest suppression should be an essential approach in order to augment such natural management strategy large scale production of biocontrol agents through entrepreneurship development is urgently required the responsibility of plant protection has been increased many folds under natural farming management of pests and diseases without using pesticides for sustainable agriculture is a major challenge on the other hand discoveries in molecular biology and nanotechnology as carrier molecule have resulted in formation of product bioclay which can be used for topical application of dsrna on crop plants the concept of biomoleculenanomaterial complexes could be the next generation agrochemicals for pest management as they would be pest specific and will have minimal ecological and environmental impacts reorientation in functioning of plant protection stakeholders for effective coordination and collaborations

production of animals keeping in view the importance of animal husbandry sector several animal health and speciesspecific institutes were established under the umbrella of icar to improve the animal health management system in the country technological interventions for over seven decades have led to the eradication of three diseases namely rinderpest 2006 contagious bovine pleuropneumonia 2007 and african horse sickness 2014 it has been estimated that rinderpest eradication has resulted in increase of milk production by 466 with a net present value of rs3463 crores 3463 billion and a cost benefit ratio of 1043 footandmouth disease fmd and peste des petits ruminants ppr control programs undertaken using indigenous technologies during last two decades also contributed to enhanced production in spite of the growing human population in the country the per capita milk availability has increased from 130 g in 1950 to 406 g in 201920 similarly the per capita per annum egg availability has increased from 5 eggs in 1950 to 86 eggs in 201920 intensification of animal production system to meet increased demand for foods of animal origin faster international trade and travel and globalization have led to higher risks of new emerging infections including zoonotic and transboundary diseases incursions of avian influenza porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome prrs lumpy skin disease lsd and african swine fever asf in the last two decades are the examples icar institutes have developed more than 25 vaccines and 40 diagnostic testsurveillance kits and several molecular methods for the diagnosis and control of livestock and poultry diseases in the country also these institutes keep a strict vigil over 30 emerging reemerging and exotic diseases by systematic surveillance using indigenously developed diagnostic methods and help implementation of national animal disease control programmes indian agriculture after independence 2321 introduction livestock and poultry farming sustain rural livelihoods and contributes 256 to the agricultural gdp and 41 to the overall gdp of india bharadwaj et al 2020 the growing demand for quality livestock products in human diet has promoted commercialization efforts which in turn has necessitated technological interventions for controlling animal diseases and efficient service delivery in the sector ahuja et al 2008 given the size and distribution of indias livestock population improvement of the livestock health and production presents a significant opportunity to enhance rural income and accelerate the pace of poverty alleviation animal diseases like fmd lsd haemorrhagic septicaemia hs brucellosis in cattlebuffalo ppr goatpox sheeppox contagious caprine pleuropneumonia ccpp in goatsheep classical swine fever csf and african swine fever asf in pig avian influenza ai newcastle disease nd and other infectious diseases in poultry birds yadav et al 2016 continue to inflict economic losses on livestock and poultry producers with trade implications owing to the technological interventions of icar institutes the livestock and poultry production and productivity have increased considerably however despite improved housing facilities balanced nutrition and disease control programmes including strict biosecurity protocols india is witnessing repeated occurrences of emerging reemerging and transboundary diseases the indian poultry industry is facing major challenges due to many diseases including complex chronic respiratory disease crd mareks disease md ai nd etc crd caused by mycoplasma gallisepticum and further complicated by avian pathogenic escherichia coli apec is a serious impediment to potential broiler production in the country postmortem based diagnosis and treatment is often not accurate and effective since mixed infections are becoming dominant and posing difficulty for differential diagnosis the porous international border across some of the north eastern states present opportunities for spread of many infectious diseases from neighboring china bangladesh bhutan and myanmar this necessitates immediate attention through systematic surveillance development of vaccines and diagnostics for onsite use along with strict border control 2 initiatives to strengthen livestock and poultry health management in india the icarindian veterinary research institute icarivri was initially established as the imperial bacteriological laboratory in 1889 at pune for conducting research for the protection of indian livestock wealth from the dreaded diseases the laboratory was shifted to mukteswar in 1893 and later in 1913 it was expanded to izatnagar bareilly to start large scale production of veterinary biologicals in view of the main focus on production of veterinary biologics the institute was renamed as imperial serum institute in 1930 but as the institute expanded to conduct research on all contemporary disciplines of veterinary and animal sciences it was renamed again as imperial veterinary research institute ivri in 1936 postindependence this institute was finally renamed as indian veterinary research achievements in animal health management in independent india 233institute ivri the most significant contributions of the institute in the field of vaccine development and production are depicted in fig 1 fig 1 important veterinary vaccines developed in the postindependence era over a period of time two animal health institutes namely icar directorate of fmd dfmd and icarnational institute of high security animal diseases nihsad were established from ivri both these institutes are now reference centers for fmd and avian influenza as recognized by fao and oie respectively research need for fmd was realized at the 11 th international veterinary congress in 1930 and later in 1943 icar initiated an adhoc scheme entitled vaccination of indian cattle against footandmouth disease at ivri mukteswar an all india coordinated research project aicrp for fmd virus serotyping was initiated in 1968 with a central fmd laboratory at mukteswar and three regional centers located at hisar hyderabad and calcutta during the year 2001 aicrp on fmd was upgraded to project directorate on fmd pdfmd with a network of 23 laboratories located all over the country in the year 2015 pdfmd was renamed dfmd with 27 regional and collaborating centers icardfmd is a member of the global faooie network of fmd reference laboratories the institute also functions as the faofmd reference center and saarc regional leading diagnostic laboratory for fmd it is a member of gfra global fmd research alliance the stateoftheart fmd research centre icfmd with high containment laboratory facility established by icar at bhubaneswar meets the major requirement of fmdcp as stipulated by oiefao high security animal diseases laboratory hsadl a regional center under ivri izatnagar was upgraded to an independent national institute and was named icarnihsad bhopal in 2014 with the main objective to deal with emerging exotic animal diseases and bioindian agriculture after independence 234risk management the institute has biosafety level 3 bsl3 biocontainment facility available for research on exotic and highrisk pathogens of livestock and poultry in india as a national referral laboratory icarnihsad is networking with all the 6 regional disease diagnostic laboratories rddls and provides diagnostic services for 30 exotic and emerging diseases as an oie reference laboratory for avian influenza icarnihsad provides diagnostic services to saarc countries also realizing the significance of disease epidemiology and informatics in disease control and eradication icar upgraded the aicrp on admas to pdadmas in 2000 and subsequently to icarnational institute of veterinary epidemiology and disease informatics nivedi in 2013 among the three phases of rinderpest rp eradication the phase of disease surveillance and monitoring was spearheaded by icarnivedi by providing nationwide rp surveillance and monitoring plan implementation strategies and screening of serum samples icarnivedi is coordinating with other institutes and developed the national disease surveillance and monitoring plan for fmd brucellosis ppr and csf the diagnostic kits developed by the institute are being used for seromonitoring under brucellosis and csf control programs considering the importance of equine species icar established national research centre on equines nrce in 1985 at hisar and its regional station in 1989 at bikaner icarnrce has developed diagnostics against various equine diseases including equine herpesvirus 1 ehv1 infection equine infectious anaemia eia theileria equi glanders and inactivated vaccines for ehv1 and equine influenza icarnrce has contributed towards declaration of diseasefree status for african horse sickness ahs by oie and control of eia and equine influenza the national centre for veterinary type cultures ncvtc established in 2005 at nrce hisar is working through 18 network units spread throughout the country and is maintaining a total of 3403 accessioned microbes animal health institutes of icar monitor the quality of veterinary biologics produced by the industry through a stringent testing policy and certify for further use in the field icar institutes have a key role in national animal disease control programs of govt of india by providing nationwide sampling plans diagnostic kits and epidemiological inputs to ensure success of animal health programs implemented by state and central governments presently technologies developed by icar institutes are being used for the diagnosis and control of four diseases viz fmd brucellosis ppr and csf rd activities in the field of stem cell biology and their application in regenerative medicine has opened new avenues for treating noncommunicable animal diseases these interventions for improving the livestock health will ensure livelihood and nutritional security of the country details given in chapter 7 3 success stories of disease eradication 31 eradication of rinderpest and its impact rinderpest also known as cattle plague was one of the most devastating diseases of cattle and buffalo during the 18th and 19th century the disease was caused by rinderpest achievements in animal health management in independent india 235virus rpv belonging to the morbillivirus group rpv also affected sheep goat and pig populations owing to the symptoms and death pattern rinderpest in india was called ponkani maanrog or pashu mahamari the first indian report on rinderpest was documented in 1752 by hallen commission clinically the diseased animals had shooting diarrhoea due to inflammation in the digestive tract nasal and ocular discharges were common in diseased animals the death and infection rates in newly exposed populations were very high and sometimes up to 95100 leading to huge economic losses before the 1950s a large number of bovine deaths were reported every year due to rinderpest in the country the incidence of disease decreased to some extent 100150 thousand after 1935 when goat tissue vaccine gtv developed at ivri mukteswar in the year 1927 edwards 1927 was applied in livestock population subsequently during the 1 st plan period 1954 a mass vaccination campaign against the cattle plague in the name of national rinderpest eradication programme nrep using gtv vaccine was launched the cattle and buffalo above 6 months of age were vaccinated using gtv vaccine subsequently a safer vaccine developed by plowright and ferris 1962 namely tissue culture rinderpest tcrp vaccine was introduced in india during 1970s yadav et al 2016 the tcrp vaccine was safe for pregnant and lactating animals and conferred lifelong immunity calf hood vaccination was done at 612 months of age and it was also efficacious in cross breed cattle sheep goats and pigs therefore this vaccine was widely adopted between 19561989 a total of 1300 million doses of vaccination against rinderpest were carried out these interventions led to reduction in disease outbreaks in india however extensive surveillance was required to prove absence of disease as per oie pathway of rinderpest eradication the overall seroconversion ratesherd immunity of more than 70 were achieved at the completion of the national vaccination campaign in 2000 this effort totally stopped the transmission cycle of rinderpest virus the mabbased rinderpest competitive elisa kit developed by icarivri validated by fao and recommended by oie was used during the final stage of rinderpest eradication the serosurveillance using indigenously developed competitive elisa kit singh et al 2000 was continued till the year 2004 in order to prove that no virus is circulating in the population the effect of vaccination on rinderpest related disease incidence mortality is shown in table

india became free from rinderpest in the year 2004 oie recognized the country free from rinderpest infection in the year 2006 and finally global eradication of rinderpest was declared by fao in the year 2011 to mark this stupendous achievement which ushered an era of agricultural revolution in the country icarivri installed a commemoration pillar at its mukteswar campus on 2 nd june 2012 the pillar depicts important landmark achievements made possible through contributions of all national and international organizations fig 2 the successful implementation of rinderpest eradication programme has yielded major economic benefits which enhanced food and nutrition security it was observed that investment made in nrep launched in 1954 yielded net benefit and significant increase in growth rates in milk production national programme on rinderpest eradication npre was launched in 199192 to eradicate rinderpest following the pathway prescribed by world organization of animal health oie the benefits of npre can be appreciated from the increased access of indias bovine meat and milk in the international market rich et al 2012 indeed indian exports of bovine milk picked up substantially around 199294 and simultaneously indias dependence on milk imports also reduced drastically at the same time bardhan 2007 these developments ultimately contributed enormously to white revolution and enhanced per capita availability of milk in the country the growth rate and economic benefits during rinderpest control and eradication is depicted in table 2 as against the huge economic benefits accrued from rinderpest eradication in india the expenditure on rinderpest vaccine research and production was estimated to be rs 47856 million 106346 million us over a period of 92 years from 1913 to 2005 yadav 2011 the fao estimated that india gained additional food production valuing 289 billion us dollars between 19651998 yadav et al 2016 fig 2 memorial at ivri mukteswar to

benefit cost ratio of npre bcr 437 there have also been several indirect benefits of rinderpest eradication which include capacity building in terms of human resource development development of disease surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure acquisition of vehicles and equipment establishment of epidemiology units creation of a wide network of veterinary departments and research institutes lessons learnt from rinderpest eradication are invaluable for achieving the goal of ppr control and eradication the important milestones on the road to eradication of rinderpest and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia are given in table 3 table 3 milestone achievements of rinderpest and cbpp eradication postindependence year milestones 1954 national rinderpest eradication programme nrep launched 1967 large scale production of tissue culture rinderpest vaccine 1983 national task force on rinderpest constituted 1987 establishment of aicrp on admas at bengaluru for rinderpest serosurveillance 1992 national project on rinderpest eradication npre launched 2000 development of faooie validated rinderpest competitive elisa kit 2003 provisional freedom from cbpp 2006 oie recognized india free from rinderpest infection 2007 india declared cbpp free by the oie 2011 fao gold medal for outstanding contribution to global rinderpest eradication program 2011 global freedom from rinderpest 2012 global rinderpest eradication memorial installed at ivri mukteswar 32 eradication of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia contagious bovine pleuropneumonia cbpp was an insidious pneumonic disease of cattle and water buffalo referred to as lung sickness it was caused by mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides m mycoides clinically cbpp was manifested by anorexia fever and respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea cough and nasal discharges eradication of cbpp was linked with the npre activities the objective of the scheme was to strengthen the indian agriculture after independence 238veterinary services to eradicate rinderpest and cbpp and to obtain freedom from rinderpest and cbpp following the pathway prescribed by oie paris the country was provisionally free from cbpp in october 2003 the eradication programme for cbpp was initiated in 8 districts of assam and the dossier for cbpp eradication was submitted to oie india was declared cbpp free by the oie in 2007 now it is important that the countrys freedom status against cbpp is maintained as per oie requirements the states and union territory governments are required to carry out physical surveillance up to the village level to maintain the freedom status of cbpp and to undertake surveillance of other animal diseases in the country on a routine basis 33 eradication of african horse sickness african horse sickness ahs is a serious fatal disease of horses mules and donkeys it is caused by a virus of the genus orbivirus belonging to the family reoviridae the virus is spread by infected insects biting midges and causes fever cardiac and respiratory breathing problems with sudden death in affected animals in india the first case was reported in cavalry of army in april 1960 from 1960 to 1963 22977 horses got affected and 20822 died 906 mortality initially ahs7 virus strain vaccine was used to control the disease however this failed to provide sufficient protection later indigenous mouse adopted strain 9 monovalent vaccine followed by ahs9 chick embryo origin vaccine was developed to control the disease the last report of ahs was in 1963 kumar 1976 in the 82 nd general session of oie india was declared free from ahs thus ivri played a lead role in eradication of ahs by contributing towards virus isolation characterization and development of vaccines and diagnostics 4 control of cattle and buffalo diseases in addition to the eradicated diseases several other livestock diseases are being monitored and controlled through different interventions 41 control of foot and mouth disease and its impact foot and mouth disease is caused by an aphthovirus of the family picornaviridae seven serotypes o a asia1 c sat1 sat2 sat3 are present globally out of the known serotypes four serotypes viz o a c and asia 1 were reported in india before 1995 now 3 serotypes o a and asia1 of the fmd virus are circulating in livestock in the country serotype c has not been recorded in india from 1995 onwards the fmd affected large ruminants exhibit high fever excessive frothy salivation vesicles in the mouth especially on the tongue teats and interdigital space and decrease in milk yield due to reduced feed intake effective vaccines with short lived immunity are available however vaccines with long term immunity are needed indigenously developed stateoftheart diagnostics are available for laboratory and field applications being a transboundary animal disease technical knowhow for fmd needs to be extended to saarc member countries which requires strong linkages with fao and oie achievements in animal health management in independent india 239the research on fmd vaccine started at ivri mukteswar in 1943 with an icar sponsored adhoc scheme vaccination of indian cattle against fmd crystal violet vaccine was prepared in the initial stages 194652 followed by goat kidney primary tissue culture methodology in 196465 and bhk21 monolayer during 197277 at mukteswar with the increasing need for fmd vaccines the bengaluru campus of ivri was established in 1972 for largescale vaccine production using suspension cell culture from 1971 to 1990 techniques for fmd virus typing microcomplement fixation test and microneutralization tests for subtyping were developed icar driven fmd research and infrastructure development contributed immensely to fmd control efforts table 4

fmdcp was launched in 200304 in selected districts of india and expanded progressively to cover the entire country in 2017 a large number of fmd outbreaks were encountered prior to fmdcp the number of fmd outbreaksindian agriculture after independence 240incidences came down by almost 60 781 from 1911 in 200607 and in 200809 the number of incidences came down to 245 further 70 drop in the incidences of the disease the progressive drop in the incidences of fmd is attributed to the herd immunity a trend of reduction in fmd outbreaks since implementation of fmdcp in 200304 is shown in fig 3 through the application of the indigenous diagnostic kits india saved revenue worth rs 531 crores during last one decade fig 3 reducing trend of fmd outbreaks in india after implementation of control programme 411 socioeconomic impact of fmd vaccines and diagnostic research to evaluate the benefits of control measures on the production of affected animals it is necessary to determine the variable effects of fmd including mortality rate usually very low reduction in milk production usually significant infertility abortion delays in attainment of slaughter weight reduced food conversion efficiency in animals and lameness in bovine draught animals it was projected that the state of andhra pradesh would stand to lose rs 1147 crore only on account of direct impacts if there were no vaccination programme against fmd the country would incur a total direct loss of rs 15575 crore according to one study the annual total economic loss due to fmd in india ranges from 12000 crore to 14000 crore singh et al 2013 another study in india estimated the benefitcost ratio bcr to be between 51 and 81 james and ellis 1978 overall existing evidence on bcr analysis of fmd vaccination in india and other endemic countries with comparable socioeconomic status as that of india strongly favours implementation of vaccinationbased control of fmd for the benefit of livestock owners there has been increase in milk yield and meat production in india over a period of time decline in incidences of fmd might have contributed to increase in milk yield and meat production in the country achievements in animal health management in independent india 24142 control of brucellosis and its impact brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by various brucella species which mainly infect cattle swine goats sheep and dogs humans generally acquire the disease through direct contact with infected animals by eating or drinking contaminated animal products the seroprevalence of brucellosis in humans varies from place to place and also depends on the type of test method applied in the study in a study conducted in and around ludhiana it was found to 266 using standard tube agglutination test stat with a titre range between 80 and 1280 iuml gamechu and gill 2011 for effective control of brucellosis calf hood vaccination programme has been initiated under national animal disease control programme nadcp reliable and verifiable diagnostics to support these efforts are available this requires very strong linkages and awareness among stakeholders ivri provided diagnostic reagents for brucellosis at national level through production and supply of rbpt antigen milk ring test mrt antigen and sat antigen recently two indirect elisa diagnostic kits have been developed one each at nivedi and ivri these diagnostic kits and the marker vaccine developed at ivri brucella abortus s19 per vaccine promise effective seromonitoring and disease control the annual economic losses due to brucellosis in different livestock species in india were estimated on the basis of secondary seroprevalence data collected from published peer reviewed literature and government reports metaanalysis was carried out to arrive at the pooled prevalence of bovine brucellosis various components of losses included in the study were reproductive losses due to abortions and increased infertility production losses mortality losses in aborted animals and draught power losses simple mathematical models were developed to estimate the componentwise losses which arrived at rs 9212 crores bardhan et al 2020b on account of the possibility of variation and uncertainty in various epidemiological and economic parameters a sensitivity analysis was also carried out by considering worstcase and bestcase scenarios the benefitcost ratio of brucellosis control through vaccination under different scenarios implied economic feasibility of vaccination 43 control of haemorrhagic septicemia and its impact haemorrhagic septicemia hs is an acute and often fatal disease of cattle and buffaloes caused by pasteurella multocida serotype b2 the disease is characterized by high fever with concurrent shivering followed by profuse salivation lachrymation nasal discharge and a sharp drop in milk yield pasteurella multocida the cause of hs was first discovered by perroncito in 1878 and the organism was isolated by louis pasteur in 1880 the work in india for control of hs was started at ivri as early as 1895 with the production of antihs serum due to the high cost involved in the production of serum and shortlived immunity serum production was discontinued after the development of improved hs vaccines due to the devastating effect of the disease on livestock the icar initiated the all india network programme on hs in the year 2000 to develop and improve vaccines against hs a low volume saponified vaccine was developed to alleviate the problem of syringibility and swelling at the injection site in animals indian agriculture after independence 242the economic loss due to hs in bovines was worked out as the sum of mortality loss direct milk yield loss losses due to increased abortions drought power loss cost of treatment and extra labour costs sample size 10839 dairy animals simple mathematical models were developed for computing componentwise losses due to the disease the economic loss per animal due to hs in india was estimated to be rs11904 rs13044 and rs20296 in the case of indigenous and crossbred cattle and buffaloes respectively the share of buffaloes in the total economic loss was highest 55 followed by indigenous 28 and crossbred 165 cattle in view of the uncertainties associated with the epidemiological and economic parameters stochastic modeling was used to estimate the economic impact of hs the estimated annual economic loss due to hs in india was about rs 12758 crores bardhan et al 2020a 44 control of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis ibr ibr is a highly contagious disease caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 bhv1 apart from respiratory disease which may lead to bovine respiratory disease complex or shipping fever after secondary bacterial infection other clinical syndromes are infectious pustular vulvovaginitis ipv or infectious pustular balanoposthitis ipb abortion conjunctivitis infertility arthritis mastitis and enteritis during the past two decades various types of vaccines developed include inactivated live modified subunit dna vaccines and gene deleted marker vaccines the gdbased subunit vaccine is considered most efficacious in reducing the clinical disease after they are combined with effective adjuvants like chitosan and cpg oligonucleotides however none of the presently available vaccines can prevent the establishment of latency of wildtype virus infection because of this countries with vaccination programmes aiming at eradication were unsuccessful while the countries with programs of culling seropositive animals could achieve disease free status the milestones for other cattle and buffalo disease control are given in table 5 table 5 achievement milestones in other diseases of cattle and buffalo for health

elisa kit developed 2022 recombinant antigen polyclonal based ppr antigen capture elisa kit developed 51 control of peste des petits ruminants and its impact peste des petits ruminants ppr popularly known as goat plague is a contagious viral disease of small ruminants caused by a morbillivirus the disease is found in several countries in asia the middle east and africa the control of disease is important from the point of view of livelihood security for millions of families involved in small ruminant husbandry the important symptoms of ppr include fever discharge from eyes and nostrils conjunctivitis gastroenteritis and pneumonia it was first described in ivory coast by gargadennec and lalanne in 1942 and in india from tamil nadu in the year 1987 the disease causes high economic losses in the country as the infection rate in goat and sheep may reach up to 8090 the range of expected economic losses due to ppr was estimated to be between rs 4571 and rs 4683 croreannum bardhan et al 2017 by the years 2001 and 2002 the technologies with proven efficacy for vaccine and mabbased diagnostic kits for antigen and antibody detection were developed the pprvsungri96 strain sreenivasa et al 2000 is a vaccine virus strain used in india under mass ppr vaccination campaigns this vaccine virus has been characterized extensively at antigenic and genomic levels singh and bandyopadhayay 2015 the longterm immunity study indicated that the vaccine induces and maintains optimum virusneutralizing antibodies for a long duration therefore a single dose is sufficient for indian agriculture after independence 244the protection of small ruminants large scale application of this vaccine to control the disease in india has been largely possible due to the government of indias supported ppr control programme and transfer of technology by icar to commercial manufacturers in the public and private sectors the monoclonal antibodybased diagnostic kits namely sandwichelisa and competitiveelisa have been used for diagnosis within the country for the last 20 years the country is now selfsufficient in requirement of ppr vaccine and conventionalmolecular diagnostics technologies including the recombinant antigen based competitive elisa kit balamurugan et al 2021a which may help during disease eradication programme the trend of disease outbreak reduction during the last 15 years since the vaccines and diagnostics became available is shown in the maps below balamurugan et al 2021b fig 4 districtwise outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants over the years districtwise cumulative outbreaks of ppr are considered one of the most important health constraints in rearing small ruminants various components of losses due to ppr in sheep and goats are mortality losses reproductive failure increased abortions body weight loss and treatment costs govindaraj et al 2016 in addition wool loss increased interlambing achievements in animal health management in independent india 245period in case of sheep and milk loss and increased interkidding period in case of goats are other important losses bardhan et al 2017 the benefitcost of mass vaccination campaign in chhattisgarh state reported benefit cost ratio net present value and internal rate of return of 491 rs 342 crores and 1466 under low incidence scenario 1241 rs 998 crores and 4304 under medium incidence scenario and 1351 rs 1096 crore and 4304 under high incidence scenario respectively govindaraj et al 2019 the change in total economic surplus due to vaccination research and delivery cost were projected from 1997 the year of the start of the research project to 2030 by which 100 of the small ruminant population is to be vaccinated as per oie fao specifications for disease eradication after adjusting to the above adoption pattern the benefits to society economic surplus and costs of the control programme were deflated using a suitable consumer price index to 2016 level using a longrun discount rate of 75 the benefits were compared to research and delivery cost and the net present value npv internal rate of return irr and benefitcost ratio bcr were calculated using the economic surplus model the change in total surplus as a result of mass vaccination of sheep and goats against ppr in india was found to be rs8253 crore per annum with bcr and npv of 1231 and rs 480 crores respectively bardhan et al 2017 it is estimated that indigenous ppr diagnostics may have saved rs 622 crore worth foreign exchange through import substitution singh et al 2009 which may have increased several folds by now 52 sheeppox and goatpox sheeppox and goatpox diseases are caused by capripox viruses all of which can infect sheep and goats modeling studies from the data collected in maharashtra suggested that it would take about 6 years for a flock or herd to recover from an outbreak with 30 43 average annual losses in income depending on flock type and the owners actions garner et al 2000 an inactivated goatpox vaccine was developed at ivri yadav et al 1986 for field use till the development of a verocell culturebased attenuated vaccine for goatpox at icarivri mukteswar during the year 2006 the lyophilized cell culture vaccine provided immunity for about 40 months lifelong this vaccine has also been used for the control of lsd in cattle as a strategy for emergency vaccination for sheeppox the rf strain of sheeppox vaccine based on lt32vero9 cell culture was developed in 1986 87 it induces protective antibodies for at least one year the vaccine is safe for pregnant animals and young ones another vero cell adapted sheeppox vaccine was also developed from an indigenous virus strain srin3800 by icarivri in 2014 the scalability of the vaccine and downstream processing is simple and easy the vaccine confers protection for up to 4 years 6 pig health management and their impact classical swine fever csf is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs it is caused by a virus of the genus pestivirus of the family flaviviridae animals with the acute disease die within 12 weeks with low virulence strains the only expression may be poor reproductive performance and the birth of piglets with neurologic defects such indian agriculture after independence 246as congenital tremors icarnivedi has developed two diagnostic kits viz i indirect elisa using recombinant antigen for detection of antibodies against csfv in pigs ii csfv ag check kit for detection of antigen in clinical specimens vaccination can prevent the spread of the disease a lapinized vaccine virus weybridge strain was adapted to grow in cell line at icarivri izatnagar the cell culture vaccine is safe and potent each dose contains at least 100 pd 50 and provides immunity for a year similarly another vaccine strain ivricsfbs using an indian isolate of csfv has been developed and the technology transferred to industry 7 equine health management and their impact 71 glanders glanders is a fatal infectious and notifiable zoonotic disease of equids caused by burkholderia mallei the long duration of therapy and unavailability of vaccine makes this pathogen formidable to control the existing control policy dictates the identification and elimination of seropositive equines the complement fixation test cft is the oieprescribed serodiagnostic method for glanders however it produces falsepositive or doubtful results with donkey and mule sera icarnrce developed three recombinant proteinbased elisas in 201213 which were validated in oie reference laboratory on glanders germany during 20152017 and hcp1 elisa showed superior performance with 9528 sensitivity and 9956 specificity elschner et al 2019 this elisa has been extensively used for surveillance of glanders by state disease diagnostic laboratories srddls and regional disease diagnostic laboratories rddls of govt of india more than 150000 equines were tested by the hcp1 elisa singha et al 2020 the elisa has proved to be safe rapid inexpensive accurate and user friendly to adopt in a diagnostic laboratory with limited resources the test has proved to be very useful in state wide surveillance and control programmes of glanders and has been commercialized 72 equine influenza equine influenza ei is an oie listed respiratory disease of horses mules ponies donkeys and zebra caused by two strains of influenza a virus viz h7n7 and h3n8 since 1980 no outbreak has been reported due to h7n7 outbreaks due to h3n8 have been regularly reported from different parts of the world the disease is highly contagious and spreads very fast through the aerosol route and is characterized by fever dry hacking cough and watery nasal discharge which later become mucopurulent in india first report of influenzalike symptoms was from erstwhile bombay in the bombay turf club in 1964 where around 400 horses had an outbreak of coughing subsequently two major epizootics have been reported the first one was in 1987 when around 83000 horses were infected mostly in northern indian states uppal et al 1989 the second epizootic occurred during 200809 in katra jk from where it spread to 14 states affecting thousands of animals and leading to huge economic losses to the stakeholders virmani et al 2010 phylogenetic analysis indicated clade 2 of the florida sublineage of the h3n8 virus icarnrce developed achievements in animal health management in independent india 247an inactivated lowcost vaccine using a virus from the outbreak of 1987 subsequently an updated inactivated equine influenza vaccine was developed during 200809 which was followed by a recombinant vaccine candidate through reverse genetic engineering icar nrce has also developed several diagnostics including haemagglutinationinhibition hi assay for serological diagnosis rtpcr qrtpcr monoclonal antibodybased sandwich elisa rtpcr for subtyping of ei virus and immunohistochemical diagnosis 73 equine herpesvirus infections equine herpesviruses ehv1 and ehv4 are the most important pathogens that infect 80 to 90 of horses by two years of age resulting in respiratory infection characterized by fever anorexia nasal and ocular discharge ehv1 causes upper respiratory tract infection in young horses at the time of weaning abortion in pregnant mares neonatal foal mortality and neurological disorders abortion is economically most crippling outcome of ehv1 infection with 95 of ehv1 associated abortions occurring in the last four months of pregnancy abortions in pregnant mares range from 48 in organized horse breeding farms in india which is the major cause of economic losses in equine industry for timely diagnosis of ehv1 nrce has developed various diagnostic assays including herp kit in 2003 monoclonal antibodybased blocking elisa kit in 2008 and recombinant protein based elisa for differentiation of ehv1 and ehv4 infection nrce annual report 2016 17 and 201718 these diagnostics have contributed towards timely diagnosis and control of disease in equine population in addition an effective inactivated vaccine equiperabort for control of abortions in pregnant mares has been developed singh et al 2009a this vaccine has been extensively tested in field trials and is now being used in organized equine farms including equine breeding studs of indian army 74 equine infectious anemia equine infectious anaemia eia is a persistent viral infection of equids caused by lentivirus of retroviridae family the eia v is mechanically transmitted from infected to susceptible equids by biting horse flies deer flies and stable fly once a horse is infected with eia v it remains infected for rest of the life and a potential source of infection to other horses there is neither effective vaccine nor treatment for this disease it is one of the notifiable equine diseases which entails implementation of strict control policy including elimination of the seropositive equids icarnrce has been regularly monitoring eia v infection in the country in india first case of eia was detected in race horses in karnataka in 1987 uppal and yadav 1989 later maximum number of eia cases n186 were detected during 19871990 but thereafter it was rarely reported as there are no specific pathognomonic clinical signs in eia demonstration of eia v specific antibody in the serum is required for confirmation of the infection agar gel immunodiffusion agid test coggins test is the oie recommended test however it lacks sensitivity and may give false negative results the test is also timeconsuming requires 48 to 72 hours therefore icarnrce developed a recombinant p26 protein based indirect elisa for eia diagnosis singha et al 2013 and the diagnostic technology has been commercializedindian agriculture after independence 24875 trypanosomiasis surra trypanosomiasis caused by trypanosoma evansi is an important disease of equines resulting in high morbidity and mortality clinical symptoms mainly are fever anaemia reduced milk yield weight loss lower work output abortion infertility and in many cases a deteriorating condition that results in death total annual economic loss associated with surra in equines has been estimated to be rs 14687 million rs 6145 to 29392 million at a 95 confidence interval icarnrce is currently monitoring the prevalence of t evansi in equines in india using antibody elisa developed by the institute kumar et al 2013a a total of 20609 equine serum samples from different states were tested up to march 2021 and 1077 522 equids were detected positive it has helped in risk assessment of trypanosomiasis in endemic areas diagnostic service has helped the animal owners in timely initiation of treatment and saving their precious animals as well as check further spread to incontact healthy animals 76 equine piroplasmosis equine piroplasmosis a ticktransmitted haemoprotozoan disease caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa theileria equi andor babesia caballi is an economically important disease of equids equine babesiosis is transmitted by ixodid tick species of genera hyalomma dermacentor and rhipicephalus diagnosis of most acute haemoparasitic infections is routinely done by microscopic examination of thick and thin smears however serodiagnosis following clinical or subclinical disease is a powerful tool in detecting and defining the prevalence of protozoan diseases nrce developed recombinant antigen based elisa kit in 2008 for the diagnosis of t equi antibodies and testing of one sample costs rs 55 only which is quite economical as compared to a commercial kit by vmrd usa costing rs 610 per sample kumar et al 2013b and kumar et al 2015 milestones registered in equine porcine canine and camel health

housing facilities and caring nutrition india is witnessing repeated occurrences of emerging and reemerging diseases especially in the organized sector now the most alarming concern is that the postmortem based diagnosis and treatment is often confusing since mixed infections are becoming dominant and pose difficulty for differential diagnosis even vaccine strains are sometimes causing the disease in birds after vaccination the northeastern part of india shares a porous border with china bangladesh bhutan and myanmar adding high burden of infectious diseases to indian poultry flocks pathogenic and emerging diseases namely avian influenza often causes heavy loss both in the domestic market and international trade respiratory disease complex and complicated chronic respiratory disease in poultry are other major challenging issues posed to the indian poultry industry 81 avian influenza except for avian influenza all poultry disease outbreaks are going almost unnoticed hence remain underreported highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai caused by the h5 subtype of type a influenza virus has emerged as an economically most important disease with a significant impact on marginal and rural backyard poultry farmers dahd 2015 the outbreaks have occurred as epidemic waves during 200809 and thereafter established as sporadic occurrences frequent detection of h5n1 infections in north eastern and eastern regions sharing borders with nepal bangladesh bhutan and myanmar indicates a regional crossborder problem with porous borders and illegal movement of poultry and poultry products contributing to the threat of potential endemic circulation within the region dhingra et al 2014 unlike other countries india is continuously experiencing a frequent outbreak of the hpai h5n1 strain dahd 2015 a survey report on poultry economics in west bengal otte et al 2008 indicated that economic impact through losses largely indian agriculture after independence 250exceeds the monetary support provided by govt and therefore there is little incentive for farmers to report infection which compromises the efficiency of passive surveillance it has been observed that the initial introduction of hpai to a country is usually associated with longdistance transmission from infected areas through migratory birds newman et al 2012 the massive border migration involvement in northeastern and eastern regions must be controlled with stringent border security measures an amount of rs 2644 crore has been paid from february 2006 to 23 rd march 2020 as compensation to poultry farmers on account of culling due to avian influenza based on each outbreak series of outbreaks till 2009 cost the poultry industry a loss of rs30 crore to date 32 outbreaks occurred with two h5 serotypes that resulted in the death and culling of 436 and 8724 lakh birds respectively nevertheless no such scientific and organized study has been conducted in india regarding the economic loss incurred due to the avian influenza outbreaks in poultry concerning each outbreak that happened between february 2006 to march 2020 india adopted stamping out protocol as the main strategy for the control of ai icarnihsad bhopal has made a tremendous effort in timely and accurate diagnosis of high and low pathogenic avian influenza in india since the occurrence of the first outbreak in 2006 in the country some of the notable diagnostic achievements include development of avian influenza antibody detection elisa kit multiplex realtime rtpcr kit for avian influenza a virus typing and h5 and h9 subtyping and lateral flow test for rapid detection of h5 avian influenza virus antigen in poultry important milestones in ai and other poultry diseases are mentioned in table 8

spreads rapidly during epizootics in poultry causing severe economic loss due to disease and for countries that export poultry or poultry products due to trade embargoes it spread rapidly in asia and became panzootic within four decades alexander et al 2012 nd has existed in india for the past 85 years and is also known as ranikhet disease rd where the disease was first noticed and described in india almost every farmer carries out nd vaccination vegad 2014 the seroprevalence of nd may be as high as 83 in the country it is the single greatest constraint limiting productivity and development throughout the developing world heterogeneity within strains of ndv may play a very important role in the maintenance and development of infection in village poultry populations r 2b mukteswar a mesogenic vaccine strain of nd is the popular vaccine strain used in the indian subcontinent especially in older birds 68 weeks old with longlasting immunity but has proven to be pathogenic for young chicks this vaccine strain had its origin by passaging one of the three indian field isolates at ivri mukteswar in 1945 and has been used as a vaccine candidate for booster immunization since then iyer and hashmi 1945 this technology has been adopted by the biggest poultry vaccine manufacturers viz indovax private limited haryana hester biosciences gujarat venkys private limited maharashtra and billions of doses have been produced a recombinant antigenbased elisa kit has also been developed for active and passive serosurveillance for newcastle disease in commercial and backyard chickens 83 infectious bursal disease infectious bursal disease ibd seen in young domestic chickens is caused by infectious bursal disease virus ibdv symptoms of the disease can include depression watery diarrhoea ruffled feathers and dehydration morbidity is high and mortality is usually low but some very virulent strains are capable of causing 60 or higher mortality macroscopic and microscopic lesions in the cloacal bursa and molecular identification of the viral genome are used for the diagnosis of the disease very virulent pathotypes of ibdv emerged in 1992 resulting in huge economic losses to the poultry industry currently ibdv is endemic and a serious problem for the poultry industry in india virulent very virulent vv and classical forms of the disease are present in india with no reports on variant form of ibdv sequence alignment of these viruses with reported viruses of other countries revealed indian ibdv field isolates to be 100 similar to very virulent japanese okym european uk661 and bangladesh bd399 ibd viruses at the amino acid level whereas they had 0209 divergence at the nucleotide level vaccination to induce maternal immunity in young chicks is initially

as pcv2a and pcv2b and its recombinants other pig pathogens detected were porcine parvovirus rotavirus enterovirus sapelovirus japanese encephalitis virus bordetella bronchiseptica and streptococcus sui s 92 parasitic diseases the development of vaccines against lungworms of sheep and bovine tropical theileriosis were useful for control of these diseases for lungworm control a gamma radiation attenuated d filaria vaccine difil was developed by ivri in 1971 the vaccine constituted infective stage l3 filarial larvae radiation attenuated at 50 krad the difil vaccination significantly reduced the incidence of lungworm infection in sheep in the temperate himalayan region a series of ectoparasitic management practices and an antitick vaccine were developed at ivri for tick management the advent of immunological and molecular techniques helped parasitologists initiate work on characterization of parasite antigens and their use in diagnosis of parasitic diseases serodiagnostic tests viz ifat elisa dot elisa selisa eitb and lat were developed and standardized for accurate diagnosis and studying seroepidemiology of trypanosomosis babesiosis theileriosis toxoplasmosis hydatidosis cysticercosis toxocariasis ancylostomiasis prepatent fasciolosis and haemonchosis 93 surgical interventions veterinary surgery is one of the dynamic and enterprising areas of veterinary science research and practice different surgical techniques like castration dehorning hoof trimming caesarean section etc have been part of the animal husbandry and management system however veterinary surgery has undergone a sea change in the past 23 decades with many advancements taking place in the areas of anesthesia and pain management minimally invasive surgical techniques and diagnostic imaging at icarivri these techniques include treatment of posterior paresis using stem cell therapy treatment of a hernia using acellular biomaterial tube cystostomy in goat and bullock epoxypin fixation for treatment of open fracture in calf treatment of compound fracture in horse using circular fixator interlocking nailing of tibia in cow etc 94 stem cell biology stem cell biology is currently one of the most potential areas of biomedical research which can revolutionize both medical and veterinary sciences icarivri has conducted research on stem cells for therapeutic application in livestock and pets emphasis on basic research is required before stemcellbased therapies are widely used in veterinary sector embryonic induced pluripotent stem cells could be used as a reference model to understand important molecular signaling pathways which control cell fate decisions and organ differentiation indian agriculture after independence 254the clinical use of stem cells in veterinary sciences is clearly in its early stages and various approaches are still being investigated to preserve the germplasm of threatenedwildlife species stem cellbased approaches could provide an opportunistic basis in the form of xenografting of testis tissue obtained quickly after the death of prepubertal animals 10 challenges and way forward development of improved vaccines thermo tolerant vaccines marker vaccines etc and point of care diagnostics should be the thrust areas of research and development for fmd serotypespecific monoclonal antibodybased elisa needs to be developed to replace polyclonal antibodybased elisas there is also an urgent need for a costeffective vaccine with longterm immunity for fmd control traditional methods for quality control of veterinary vaccines and drugs can be time taking and expensive therefore there is an urgent need to develop alternate models that obviate the use of animals ethical use of experimental animals is also the compelling reason to develop alternate systems for quality control of veterinary vaccines and therapeutics the emergence of lumpy skin disease lsd in cattle and its rapid spread is a significant threat to cattle farming in india control of lsd mainly relies on early diagnosis along with restriction on movement of cattle in the affected areas effective vector control measures proper vaccination and awareness of livestock farmers icar institutes ivri and nrce are working on development of a candidate vaccine for lsd in cattle important diseases like brucellosis can be controlled to some extent by calf hood vaccinations but r d for developing therapeutic strategy of the livestock is required similarly some strategy for the control of bovine tuberculosis is also need of the hour even with the proven animal health technologies the major challenge lies with the implementation of disease control program in a diverse country like india as the execution part rests with the state animal husbandry departments csf control in pigs is very important and a cell culture vaccine developed by ivri is expected to contribute immensely to its control but new diseases such as prrs in 2013 and asf in 2020 have entered the indian pig population these diseases cause heavy mortality and morbidity in swine the complex nature of the prrs and its genetic and antigenic variations pose a great challenge in the diagnosis and control of the disease the management of farms and related biosecurity diagnosis and surveillance lack of public awareness and concerns from across the border are the major challenges to control of prrs and asf in india avian influenza continues to be a serious concern because of its destabilizing effect on the poultry sector and public health risk country wide surveillance early diagnosis of avian influenza along with subtype identification will help implementation of rapid and effective control measures to check further spread in the past two decades a large number of new viral infections with severe lifethreatening and economic consequences have emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and sarscov2 covid19 corona viruses emerged from bats crimean congo haemorrhagic fever cchf and ebola are currently the most important threats after the first report of cchf from gujarat in 2011 it has been reported sporadically from gujarat rajasthan and uttar pradesh with current threats of achievements in animal health management in independent india 255cchf ebola nipah and other zoonotic viruses icarnihsad has an important role to play in conducting surveillance of these diseases in animals or vector hosts of these viruses including wildlife since many of these emerging diseases have originated from animals it is expected that more will follow unless a close watch is kept at the interface of animal human interaction anthropogenic factors are also responsible for facilitating the species jump of pathogens from wild animals to humans the impact of any such pandemic such as the covid19 in recent time is tremendous and such episodes can perhaps be avoided through the one health approach that the scientific world is now advocating the animal health institutes of icar contributed to the fight against covid19 pandemic and are continuing it through the one health approach to combat zoonotic disease threats to public health 11 conclusion icars pathbreaking innovative and cuttingedge technologies have helped the livestock and poultry industry to flourish and contribute extensively to raising the income of livestock owners animal health institutes of icar have developed more than 25 vaccines and about 80 diagnostics including nucleic acidbased tests which have played a significant role in the control of economically important diseases and eradication of some of them from the country in the current era of intellectual property rights the adoption of new technologies from other sources requires various protocols hence it is very important to develop indigenous technologies as has been emphasized by the government of india through slogans v ocal for local and atmanirbhar bharat besides prevention and control of endemic diseases the emergence of new diseases requires a robust disease forecasting mechanism preparedness and rapid emergency response to prevent the incursion of new transboundary diseases exotic diseases therefore advanced preparedness to handle any such eventuality through prior risk assessment and rapid emergency response becomes very important to combat such incursions recent experiences with covid19 pandemic emphasize the need for robust epidemiological data and availability of indigenous and cost effective diagnostics vaccine platforms for dealing with such outbreaks and pandemics there is an urgent need for greater regional collaboration and cooperation with organizations like bimstec asean saarc etc for sharing of information and technical know how including microbial resources for monitoring and control of animal diseases references ahuja v rajasekhar m and raju r 2008 animal health for poverty alleviation

islam and bp bhatt indian council of agricultural research new delhi summary india accounts for 24 of global land mass and 4 of water resources indicating a tremendous pressure for providing livelihood support to about 18 of the global population and to a growing economy the finite land and water resources are vital for agricultural production for securing food for all kinds of life however competing demands of the various land uses have put more pressure on these precious natural resources that caused their depletion and deterioration in india 37 of total geographical area is degraded due to various natural and anthropogenic factors also unplanned development and management of water resources have led to negative environmental consequences such as waterlogging and salinity in many canal command areas decline in groundwater level and its quality seawater intrusion in coastal areas drying up of wetlands and lowflows in streams etc to address the twin challenges of degradation of land resources and declining productivity development of efficient and ecofriendly resource management technologies is necessary to maintain the soil health manage water efficiently and to achieve sustained crop productivity indian council of agricultural research icar through its 15 institutes under natural resource management nrm division is mandated for research on conservation and management of natural resources in different agroecologies of arid semiarid coastal hill and irrigated areas so as to sustain the production systems with this backdrop the important achievements include concept of targeted yield based fertilizer requirement to address the issue of excessive use of fertilizer in agriculture in order to correct imbalance use of fertilizers mridaparikshak a portable soil test kitmini lab has been developed it is capable of analysing all the 12 soil parameters included in the soil health card scheme of the government for better management of soils multiple thematic maps for red soils acid soils wastelands and degraded land were prepared at country level the agroecological mapping of the country facilitated delineation of 20 agroecological regions aers and 60 agroecological subregions aesrs for efficient management and planning of natural resources the bioengineering measures sand dune stabilization and shelterbelt technologies have been able to control erosion the participatory watershed management for integrated management of land water and vegetation resources were successfully demonstrated in different agroecological regions in order to achieve food and nutritional security at household level 64 prototype integrated farming system ifs models with potential to enhance the income by 3 to 5 times over the existing systemsindian agriculture after independence 260practices of farmers in a period of 3 to 4 years have been developed for promoting organic farming in niche areas 68 organic packages have been developed and integrated in central sector schemes of paramparaghata krishi vikas yojna pkvy and mission on organic value chain development movcd for neh region climate resilient technologies under network project on national innovations on climate resilient agriculture nicra have also been developed for different agroecologies of the country 1 introduction the land and water are the basic natural resources for agricultural growth and development of a country when population was low a single crop in a year was adequate to feed the masses as the population grew the demand for food grains and other agricultural commodities increased leading to intensification in agriculture and therefore the natural resources were put under intensive usage in some of the most productive geographies further indiscriminate exploitation intensive agricultural practices and of late climate change induced weather aberrations are causing damage to the finite natural resources as the luxury of horizontal spread of cropping is drying up and squeezing in some states the only option left is vertical intensification for producing more per unit area to maintain the supply of adequate and nutritious food to all the sustainability of natural resources is the concern of all in the realm of competing demands of the various land uses and the problem of not only depleting but also deteriorating natural resources the available estimates show that about 37 of the total geographical area of india ie 120 million ha mha is under different types of land degradation naas 2010 further widespread deficiency of secondary and micronutrients over exploitation of groundwater irrigation induced salinization increase in area under current fallows increasing diversion of prime lands to nonagricultural uses and declining factor productivity in most of the crops particularly in the irrigated lands are the major bottlenecks in agricultural development the over dependence of groundwater and nonsustainable use of surface water resources has caused negative environmental consequences on availability of water quantity as well as quality it is imperative to address the twin challenges of preventing the degradation of land and water resources and simultaneously increasing their productivity the aquifers are contaminated with boron fluoride arsenic iron and even uranium and it has severe consequences on humananimal health if used for irrigationdrinking purposes the governance of irrigation systems and its management is even alarming while agriculture is the major user of the water the water governance rests with other agency of the states the delivery of the surface water is marked with very low efficiency it is estimated that the major and medium irrigation projects operate at very low irrigation efficiency of around 38 however the groundwater irrigation system has relatively better irrigation efficiency 6570 the efficiency of surface irrigation system can be improved from about 3540 to around 50 60 and that of groundwater from about 6570 to 7275 planning commission 2009 the national water mission under national action plan for climate change has set the target to improve the efficiency of water use by at least 20 the climate change impact would further affect the agricultural production systems in india the recent study of world achievements in natural resource management in independent india 261bank revealed that india would lose 28 of its gdp by 2050 on account of climate change impacts causing significant reduction in living standards mani et al 2018 the major challenges for sustainable agriculture in the coming years include increase in rainfall high inter annual variability intense and frequent heat waves increase in temperature 15 to 40 oc and rise in sea level ipcc 2021 these stresses may hit the small farmers the most india has 23 of small farms of the world hence production systems of the small holders are risk prone and challenging however diversified agriculture could help sustaining the natural resources and increase the income of small farms this chapter focuses on the natural resources management nrm initiatives of indian council of agricultural research icar in the postindependent india accomplishments made and the success stories under diverse agroecologies of the country 2 achievements in natural resources management indian council of agricultural research through its research institutions and all india coordinated research projects aicrpsnetwork projects npsconsortia research platforms crps with wide network of cooperating centres under nrm division are conducting research on conservation of natural resources in different agroecologies of arid semiarid coastal hill and irrigated areas the milestones table 1 and salient achievements made in the post independent india are briefly presented below 21 land resource inventorization for conservation and management efficient land management encompassing soil and water conservation is the building block for sustainable agricultural development all india soil survey scheme started in 1943 for the systematic soil survey prepared the first comprehensive information on soil survey in 1953 the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbsslup was established in 1976 following the recommendations of task force on land and soil resources for focused research on soil correlation classification uniform nomenclature and proper mapping since then the soil map of the country at 11 million scale fig 1 states soil maps at 1250000 scale district soil maps at 1 50000 scale and several thematic maps were brought out presently land resource inventory at 110000 scale fig 2 is under preparation using highresolution remote sensing data and digital elevation models and ground truthing for block level land use planning in order to address eco regionbased solutions the agroecological region map of india was brought out in 1990 the country was delineated into 20 agroecological regions and 60 agroecological sub regions the agroecological region map was revised in 2016 using new soil data set climatic resource data base of 600 weather stations and new estimates of the length of growing periods lgp the land degradation map of india was developed in 1994 which was further refined in 2010 using the harmonized data base of land degradation of other agencies fig 3 the estimates showed that about 1204 mha of total geographical area of the country is affected by various kinds of land degradation naas 2010 this includes water erosion 826 mha wind erosion 120 mha chemical degradation 248 mha and physical degradation 10 mha the large chunk of these degraded soils 1042 mha indian agriculture after independence 262comes under

agriculture after independence 26622 soil health management the united nations un millennium development task force on hunger included soil health enhancement as one of the five recommendations for increasing agricultural productivity and fight hunger in india the first mobile soil testing van was acquired by indian agriculture research institute iari from united states agency for international development usaid during 1950s for collecting soil samples at the farmers fields and onspot soil test reports and fertiliser application advisories the soil testing laboratory established at iari in 195556 was the main coordinating centre of soil testing activity in the country the largescale use of chemical fertilizers 1960s onwards with the introduction of high yielding dwarf varieties of rice and wheat and development of irrigation facilities led to green revolution therefore a landmark in fertilizer research the targeted yield concept to determine the fertilizer requirement was initiated in 1967 ramamoorthy et al 1967 for the first time widespread micro and multinutrient deficiencies under intensive cropping systems was reported by dr bv mehta the twin developments led to launch of aicrps on soil test crop response stcr and micro and secondary nutrients and pollutant msnp elements in soils and plants chhonkar et al 2015 the development of nutrient indexbased soil fertility maps and fertilizer prescription equations for various crops under aicrpstcr formed the basis of a nationwide programme on soil health card under the national mission for sustainable agriculture nmsa the

india in 1947 led to initiation of simple fertilizer trials on cultivators fields scheme during 195253 this scheme helped popularization of fertilizer use and increase in crop productivity in the early days in 1956 model agronomic experiments were added and all india coordinated agronomic experiments scheme started as an icar project in 196869 the reshaped all india coordinated agronomic research project aicarp with two components namely model agronomic experiments and simple fertilizer trials was implemented with the broadened objectives of model agronomic experiments to study the response of high yielding varieties of cereals to intensive use of different inputs like fertilizer irrigation weed control liming etc aicarp contributed appreciably for the development of package of agronomic management practices for newly introduced high yielding varieties and played a critical role in bringing green revolution in india intensification and diversification of croppingfarming systems although the system based research was initiated during early seventies but got focus with the establishment of project directorate for cropping systems research pdcsr in 1989 the onstation and farmers participatory onfarm research were included in the new set up network project achievements in natural resource management in independent india 271on organic farming was started in 200405 as a new scheme with the changing dynamics of cropping moving towards multiple enterprises within the farms for enhanced income and livelihood support the scope of pdcsr was further broadened to move from cropping system to farming system in 2010 later on in 2014 the project directorate was elevated to indian institute of farming systems research iifsr the designing and development of cropping systems resulted in double cropping in 25 of the single crop area in a year the irrigation expansion also added to it the various land configurations evolved like bed and sunken furrow dyke and pond etc over the years offer scope for growing more than two crops at the same time in the same piece of land in limited land and water plus ecologies the dyke and pond system helped to evolve vertical cropping systems integrated farming systems the ifs is the potential tool for enhancing farm productivity and income of small and marginal farmers a total of 64 prototype ifs models including 8 integrated organic farming system models iofs suitable for 26 statesuts have been developed thirtyone ifs models suitable for 22 states have been identified as bankable for financing from banks by nabard these models provide scope to double the farm income apart from meeting the sustainable development goals ifs models developed are being promoted through convergence mode by union and state governments till march 2022 kerala odisha and tamil nadu state governments have promoted the ifs models by involving 21040 942 and 28490 farm households respectively with a financial outlay of rs 27919 crores these ifs models have the potential to increase the income by 3 to 5 times than existing systemspractices of farmers in a period of 3 to 4 years organic farming network project on organic farming npof was initiated in 2004 at 13 centres to promote organic farming during 2017 number of centers was increased to 20 in order to represent various niche areas identified for organic and natural farming in the country the project helped in developing package of practices for organic production of 68 cropping systems suitable to be adopted in 16 states and identification of 104 varieties suitable for growing under organic farming besides 8 iofs models biochemical characterization and molecular identification of microbes in 5 indigenous organic preparations were also attempted through convergence with central sector schemes like paramparagat krishi vikas yojana pkvy and mission organic value chain development for north eastern region movcdner the organic farming is being promoted in niche areas identified by the government of india agroforestry interventions over the years agroforestry af has evolved as an assured land use system against crop failure as it plays a role in reducing vulnerability increasing resilience of farming systems and buffering households against climate related risks in addition to productivity role it also contributes towards ecosystem services water soil health and biodiversity there are number of options which can be integrated with af to ensure livelihood security in rural areas such as apiculture sericulture lac cultivation gum and resin and medicinal and aromatic plants in order to strengthen af research national research centre nrc on af was established in may 1988 at jhansi for network research aicrpaf was started since february 1983 based on the objectives indian agriculture after independence 272and mandate of the institute in national perspective the nrcaf was upgraded to central agroforestry research institute cafri so far the institute has developed 40 af models suitable for 20 agroecological regions of the country the institute has also mapped the area under agroforestry in the country besides developing location specific af models the national agroforestry policy nap adopted by the country in 2014 is instrumental to implement focused program on af in different states the nap of india is a comprehensive policy framework designed to improve agricultural livelihoods by maximizing agricultural productivity for mitigating climate change impact af research and extension is being supported under several schemesprojects of govt of india like national bamboo mission national horticulture mission national biofuel policy task force on greening india 2001 national policy on farmers 2007 and green india mission 2010 the national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard also provides financial and banking institutional support for promotion of agroforestry models developed by the icar reducing chemical footprints in agriculture realization of higher agricultural production has been associated with higher chemical footprints in the environment unbalanced use of fertilizers in agriculture in certain crops regions is leading to land degradation water and air pollution unhealthy ecosystem and adulterated food posing risks to human health this has brought focused attention of all concerned to chemical free farming including organic farming technologies that recover revitalize and restore the soil and the environment looking into the emerging scenarios and need to develop alternate production systems icar initiated pilot study on chemical free farming since 2017 under all india network programme on organic farming the experiment for evaluation of concoctions of zero budget farming practices in basmaticoarse ricewheat system was conducted during 20172020 at 4 locations the natural farming concoctions of jeevamrit beejamrit and ghanjeevamrit were compared with integrated crop management and ai npof developed organic farming package since kharif 2020 evaluation and validation of beejamrit jeevamrit ghanjeevamrit intercropping mulching and whapasa have been initiated at 20 locations in 16 states 25 management of challenged agroecologies arid agriculture the arid zone of india covers about 12 of the countrys geographical area and occupies over 32 m ha area of hot desert and 7 mha under cold arid zone in order to address the challenges of arid agriculture central arid zone research institute jodhpur was established in 1952 which owes its origin to desert afforestation research station dars for undertaking research work on stabilization of sand dunes and establishment of shelterbelts dars was reorganized as desert afforestation and soil conservation station dascs in 1957 which was renamed as central arid zone research institute cazri in 1959 and brought under the umbrella of icar in 1966 the institute has developed various agroforestry models for arid environment and more recently an agrivoltaic system of 105 kw for crop production and electricity generation from a single land use resulted in 129266 kwh annual power output the short statured kharif and rabi pulses spices and vegetables were successfully grown in the inter panel spaces icarcazri agrivoltaic achievements in natural resource management in independent india 273concept has been utilized for the development of majority of the 13 operational agrivoltaic systems in the country at present the institute has also developed a technology for gum exudation from acacia senagal with its adoption in western rajasthan madhya pradesh and gujarat fig 13 intercrops with solar panels in solar farming in rajasthan agriculture in northeastern hill region agriculture in the himalayan region is marked by monocropping small and fragmented land holdings high rate of soil erosion soil acidity lack of mechanization and water scarcity shifting agriculture the major land use in northeastern hill region is quite distinct from settled agriculture practiced in other parts of the country on an average 1015 years of jhum cycle was considered to be sustainable of late the jhum cycle has reduced to 45 years which is a major threat to the resource conservation and food security in order to provide alternatives to shifting agriculture icar research complex for north eastern hill neh region was established at barapani meghalaya in the year 1975 with its regional stations in all the northeastern states including sikkim farming system research is the core strength of the institute and developed six ifs models for long term data generation the institute has also developed seven intensive integrated farming system iifs models for achieving food and nutritional security besides value addition product diversification and needful employment opportunities and replicated these models at 36 different locations of entire neh region further to move towards chemical free agriculture in niche area of hill agriculture integrated organic farming system iofs suitable for the region has been developed and promoted in the clusters through movcdner livestock based enterprises soil acidity amelioration citrus rejuvenation bamboo and alder based agroforestry systems jalkund are some other important technologies developed by the institute besides varietal development in rice maize vegetables guava and pulse crops indian agriculture after independence 274coastal agriculture the coastal region of india is spread over 75 coastal districts in 9 states gujarat maharashtra goa karnataka kerala tamil nadu andhra pradesh odisha and west bengal and 2 uts daman and diu dadra and nagar haveli and puducherry poor productivity of crops livestock and fisheries sea water ingression and salinity small and marginal land holdings etc are the major challenges faced by coastal farmers to improve productivity of crops livestock and fishery and augment farmers income central coastal agriculture research ccari has developed four rice varieties four cashew varieties and a cowpea variety the institute has also developed ifs models for coastal region cumulatively all the technologies benefitted around 140 lakh farm families and generated an employment opportunities of 521 lakh mandays 26 rainfed agriculture rainfed agriculture accounts for about 50 net sown area in india and is crucial to countrys economy and food security since it contributes to about 40 of the total food grain production it also supports twothirds of livestock and 40 of human population and influences livelihood of 80 of small and marginal farmers climatic risks like droughts unseasonal high intensity rainfall events and floods poor water and nutrient retention capacity of soil and low soil organic matter som impact highly vulnerable rainfed agriculture requiring a different outlook and strategy to address these challenges of rainfed agriculture the government during 196974 emphasized on the participation of dryland farmers in the agricultural development process and in response to this icar launched aicrp for dryland agriculture aicrpda in collaboration with the canadian international development agency cida in 197071 in 1976 the operational research project orp was introduced for technology assessment refinement and transfer in april 1985 the project directorate was upgraded to central research institute or dryland agriculture crida to undertake basic and strategic research while adaptive research continued with aicrpda the institute has developed 75 location specific doable dryland technologiespractices such as in situ and ex situ rain water harvesting and conservation alternate and efficient cropping systems integrated nutrient management drought tolerant varieties etc and are integrated in to package of practices in the states where drylands are common and have been disseminated through kvkssaus also identified 46 climate resilient varieties of rainfed crops to cope with delayed onset of monsoon in various agroclimatic zones in 15 states and also demonstrated realtime contingency plans rtcps to manage weather aberrations in cluster villages in 23 districts dryland technologies have been integrated in to national schemesprogramme such as the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mgnrega national mission on sustainable agriculture nmsa rashtriya krishi vikas yojana rkvy pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy national rural livelihoods mission nrlm etc and at various state level programmesschemes achievements in natural resource management in independent india 27527 climate resilient agriculture in india the estimated agricultural production loss in 2030 due to climate change will be over us7 billion severely affecting the income of 10 of the population this can be reduced by 80 if costeffective climate resilience measures are implemented eca 2009 rainfed crops are likely to be worst hit by climate change because of the limited options for coping with variability of rainfall and temperature to meet the challenges of sustaining domestic food production in the face of changing climate and to generate information on adaptation and mitigation in agriculture icar launched a flagship network project on national innovations in climate resilient agriculture nicra in 2011 the project was launched to conduct research on climate change demonstrate resilient technologies and build capacity of farmers and other stakeholders the project is implemented through components viz strategic research technology demonstration and dissemination and capacity building in 151 clusters of villages in each one of the identified climatically vulnerable districts to demonstrate proven technologies and enhance adaptive capacity of farmers in the 1980s research on climate change impacts on crops was initiated simulation models were found to be very useful in assessing climate change impacts and in 1984 the first crop simulation model named wheat growth simulators wtgrows was developed in 2006 a generic crop simulation model for the assessment of crop yields losses due to pest and environmental impact of agroecosystems in tropical environments named infocrop was developed aggarwal et al 2006 analysis of the impact of climate change on crops using both the models showed that rainfed rice yields in india are projected to reduce marginally by 25 in 2050 and 2080 scenarios similarly irrigated rice yields are projected to reduce by 7 in 2050 and by 10 in 2080 scenarios climate change is projected to cause reduction in wheat yield in the timely sown irrigated wheat by 6 in 2020 scenario from existing levels however late and very late sown wheat yields are projected to decrease by about 18 in 2020 23 in 2050 and 25 in 2080 scenarios yields of maize cultivated in monsoon season can reduce mostly in southern plateau up to 35 winter yields will reduce in mid indogangetic plains up to 55 while upper indogangetic plains will be relatively unaffected climate change in 2050 and 2080 scenarios is projected to reduce the irrigated kharif maize yields by 18 to 23 on the other hand it was also predicted that crops like soybean groundnut and chickpea would be benefited by climate change risk and vulnerability assessment assessing vulnerability to climate change and variability is an important first step in evolving appropriate adaptation strategies to changing climate adopting the definition of vulnerability given by ipcc vulnerability was assessed for 572 rural districts of india thirtyeight indicators reflecting sensitivity adaptive capacity and exposure were chosen to construct the composite vulnerability index climate projections of the providing regional climates for impacts studies precis model for a1b emission scenario for the period 20212050 were considered to capture the future climate the data on these indicators were normalized based on the nature of the relationship they were then combined into three indices for sensitivity exposure and indian agriculture after independence 276adaptive capacity which were then averaged with weights given by the experts to obtain the relative vulnerability index based on the index all the districts were divided into five categories with an equal number of districts one more district was added to very high and high vulnerability categories the analysis showed that districts with higher levels of vulnerability are located in the western and peninsular india it is also observed that the highly fertile indogangetic plains are relatively more sensitive but less vulnerable because of higher adaptive capacity and lower exposure the recent study on risk and vulnerability assessment of agriculture to climate change by icar showed that out of 573 districts 109 were falling under very high risk prone and 201 are highly prone rama rao et al 2019 this document is helpful for prioritization of resources related to climate change action plans for adaptation and risk reduction contingency plans in the face of increasing climate variability adoption and implementation of the district agricultural contingency plans dacps is a priority for many state governments icar has prepared dacps for 650 districts of the country recommending location specific climate resilient crops and varieties and management practices for use by the state departments of agriculture and farmers these dacps cover drought delay in monsoon onset long dry spells in monsoon causing early mid and lateseason droughts delayed or limited release of water for irrigation floods unseasonal rains and heat wave cold wave untimely and high intensity rainfall frost hailstorm cyclone pest and disease outbreaks the twostep implementation of district plans involves preparedness and realtime activation of the contingency measures srinivasarao et al 2020 greenhouse gas ghg emission and mitigation one of the major contributions of nrm research in the country has been rationalization of methane emission from indian rice fields in the 1990s based on very limited measurements indian rice fields were attributed to emit 375 mt of methane systematic and multilocation measurements showed that the indian rice fields covering an area of about 44 mha emit 33 mt of methane pathak 2015 current ghg emission inventory of the country shows that agriculture sector emits 407821 gg of co 2 during 2016 which is 14 of the emissions of india india is on its way to meet its commitment to reduce its emissions intensity of gdp by 3335 below 2005 levels well before 2030 moefcc 2021 a network of ghg emissions from different production systems has been established to develop regionspecific emission factors for reporting ghg inventory from agriculture sector practices which can further reduce the ghg emissions like improved systems of rice cultivation fertilizer management improved fertilizer materials crop diversification etc are explored from the ricebased systems further conservation agriculture ca can reduce ghg emission by 1520 climate resilient villages crvs the concept of climate resilient village has been initiated to provide stability to farm productivity and household income and resilience through livelihood diversification under extreme climatic events srinivasarao et al 2016 location specific climate resilient technologies crts were demonstrated for coping with climate variability in vulnerable districts to generate awareness and build capacity of farmers and other stakeholders and to evolve innovative institutional mechanisms at village achievements in natural resource management in independent india 277level so as to enable the communities to respond to climate stresses the interventions included natural resource management crop production livestock and fisheries innovative institutional interventions such as village climate resilience management committee vcrmc custom hiring centres chc seed and fodder production systems were established in the nicra villages enabled to sustain the activities envisaged and scaling up of interventions the program started with 100 villages representing 100 climatically vulnerable districts during 2011 and subsequently expanded to 151 districts covering of 446 villages one village cluster from each of the 151 districts were selected by the respective kvk in the district for farmer participatory programme implementation the crv models have been adopted for upscaling by state governments of maharashtra and bihar and several national and international funding agencies nabard adb world bank the carbon sink also increased due to adoption of resilient practices suggesting reduction in net ghg emissions human resource development under nicra the nicra project enabled to network with 1200 scientists and 872 young research fellows in the climate change research the skilled scientific man power and state of the art research infrastructure established at several icar institutes and state universities encouraged students to takeup research work for the award of 126 phd and 85 msc degrees during the past 10 years 17250 capacity building programs were conducted benefiting 525816 stakeholders bibliometric science mapping and metaanalysis of 424 research articles published under nicra over the past one decade 201020 indicated that the collaboration index was 31 with 617 coauthors per scholarly publication showing the interdisciplinary team approach among the researchers in the network the sustained and longterm funding support also showed increased publication of research articles in peer reviewed journals growth rate of 2087 per annum 3 impact of nrm technologies impact assessment of promising technologies has been carried out technology development on watershed management showed that nearly 5761 mha area has been developed under various watershed development schemes metaanalysis of 311 watersheds in india revealed that watershed interventions have been found to be very effective in terms of prevention of land degradation water conservation and production enhancement besides mitigating adverse impact of flood and drought the mean benefitcost ratio of watershed program in the country was quite modest at 214 with internal rate of return of 22 joshi et al 2005 technology generation on reclamation of problem soils was able to rehabilitate 18 mha of sodic soils 080 mha of saline soils and 01 mha of waterlogged saline soils subsurface drainage technology proved increase in cropping intensity by more than 100 with improvement in yield of paddy 45 wheat 111 and cotton 215 standardized fertigation schedules have showed promising outcomes with 980 higher yield 1171 irrigation water saving and 1825 fertilizer saving in various crops grown under varying soil textural classes across the country icar flexi check dam rubber dam for watershed indian agriculture after independence 278resulted in enhancement of rice productivity 22 to 62 pulse productivity 46 and vegetable productivity 22 to 48 besides increase in cropping intensity 31 cultivated land utilization index 40 multiple cropping index 1525190 and crop diversification index 039 to 049 with a benefit cost ratio of 230 jena 2018 intervention on neem coating of urea was able to improve the nitrogen use efficiency by 10 development of mridaparikshak helped in distribution of about 28 million soil health cards to the stakeholders similarly a total of 31891 organic clusters were formed during 201516 to 201819 to promote organic farming in 238 lakh ha area likewise adoption of resource conservation technologies has brought nearly 20 mha area under zero tillage and bed planting in indo gangetic plains the integrated farming system ifs models have been able to ensure food and nutritional security at household level besides making the farming as a profitable venture on an average stakeholders could achieve the increase in their income to the tune of 15 36 lakh per annum by adopting ifs area under agroforestry land use has been estimated to be 28427 mha ie 865 of the total geographical area of the country biointensive efficient alternative cropping systems for different agroclimatic zones with potential productivity ranging from 16 to 35 t ha 1yr1 have also been developed these alternative systems along with production packages have been included in the crop production guide package of practices of respective states the system approach enhanced the resource recycling by 2530 with increase in rural employment by 2530 besides enhancement of farm income by 23 times 4 way forward the past 75 years of independence could saw a significant progress in the field of natural resource management starting from a concept of simple fertilizer response experiments to estimates of greenhouse gas emission and phenomics for crop phenotyping to identify the climate resilient traits the next phase of research should orient towards reducing the chemical foot prints and studying water foot prints in the system mode approach the fifthgeneration technologies like remote sensing gis artificial intelligence etc need to be refined and validated for soil health management in diverse agroecologies in order to enhance water productivity i promotion of less water consuming crops ii promotion of efficient irrigation methods including piped network for water conveyance iii promotion of solar photovoltaic pumping systems for groundwater pumping iv conjunctive use of rain surface and groundwater resources v encouraging communitygroup tube wells for efficient use of groundwater resources vi canal automation for improving water productivity in irrigated ecosystems and vii use of internet of things iot enabled sensor based smart irrigation management system for precise irrigation water application and efficient use of water need to be standardized and upscaled through proper convergence mechanisms crop diversification should also be promoted to achieve low water foot prints in intensive agricultural ecosystems the changing climate would further reduce the availability of fresh water for irrigation of crops hence the district climate change adaptation plans need to be developed and risk assessment at subdistrict level which will enable prioritization of resilient practices in the district under strategic research of achievements in natural resource management in independent india 279nicra germplasm collected screened and genes identified in several crops for different climatic stresses should be used in breeding programs to develop new climate resilient varieties the nicra model villages need to be expanded in more risk prone districts as per the revised risk and vulnerability assessment through convergence mechanisms with dafw mord corporates ngos and moahfd establishment of indiaflux network with trained manpower for estimating emissions at landscape level for major cropping systems is need of the day to generate accurate and precise data on ghgs from agriculture sector development of climate resilient livestock modules using indigenous breeds life cycle analysis for estimating carbon foot prints and digital tools for pest prediction are some of the future activities contemplated to deal with changing climate in agriculture sector upscaling of climate smart agriculture through large scale adoption of proven farming system models organicnatural farming practices and conservation agriculture is very much essential to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs 5 conclusion as the agricultural development progressed the food production increased substantially but with a heavy cost to soil health and the environment widespread land degradation spatial and temporal variability of monsoon rainfall resulting in frequent drought and floods deteriorating soil health low nutrient and water use efficiency and low water productivity are some of the major challenges in the agriculture today as the indian agriculture is typified as small holders farming the major burnt of these challenges are faced by this vulnerable class of farmers the vulnerability of these households to climate change is very high due to diversity and less capacity to purchase the inputs icar through its multifaceted location specific research outfits helped designing and development of new cropping systems for irrigated and rainfed areas integrated farming systems for different strata of farmers micro level land use planning bioengineering measures for soil and water conservation reclamation and amelioration technologies for salt affected waterlogged and acid soils integrated nutrient management resource conservation technologies conjunctive use of rain surface and groundwater resources efficient and energy saving irrigation methods multiple use of water and participatory watershed management including agroforestry interventions for sustainable natural resource management these technologies coupled with application of geoinformatics information and communication technology as well as climate smart agricultural practices may go a long way in managing natural resources visavis improving land water and crop productivity while assessment of climate change impacts on crops natural resources livestock and fisheries is a continuing process the development and deployment of proven resilient technologies are important for adaptation and mitigation icar has moved on this path with the demonstration of crts in 151 village clusters one each in the identified climatically vulnerable districts the appetite for upscaling of the adaptation and mitigation practices evaluated under nicra has been apparent with the states and other agencies coming forward for upscaling the proven crts across the country indian agriculture after independence 280references aggarwal pk kalra n

jharkhand summary agricultural development in india is the outcome of coordinated interplay of manmachine material interface while the food grains production touched the record high of 31451 million tons mt in 2022 with similar increase in other food and nonfood commodities we are encountering the simultaneous increase in input cost and degradation of natural resources with inefficient input utilization with the changing economies at micro and macro level the demand for food is diversifying towards better quality processed and raw foods as the luxury of putting more area under cultivation has dried up increasing the per unit land and labour productivity in agriculture in the realm of over 69 of the marginal farmers having less than one hectare land is the only option the land holding is continuously declining and about 86 farmers are small and marginal farm mechanization also offers an opportunity to retain youth in agriculture by improving comfort as compared to that in the traditional farming and enhancing the income the demand for mechanization is consistently increasing and farmers manufacturing industries with their network government and ngos are engaged in promoting appropriately mechanized agriculture icar with its network of specialized institutions has actively been engaged in needbased research and development of mechanized tools equipment machinery for production and postharvest operations in food feed fodder fibre natural resins and gums independent india started with indigenous manual or animaldriven agricultural tools followed by their improved precision versions the farm mechanization got a real boost as a response to intensive cropping strategy during the green revolution resulting in a mass scale import and adoption of mechanically powered tools equipment and machinery as the technological advancements took place in cropping and resource management the tractors and mechanically powered equipment made inroads in the agriculture research focus also reoriented from animal traction to mechanically powered equipment the exponential growth in tractor sector during past three decades resulted in more than 75 million tractors achievements in agricultural engineering in independent india 283in the fields today and farm power availability increasing from 03 kw ha1 during 1960 to 254 kw ha1 in 2020 along with tractors significant growth in power tillers combine harvesters diesel engines and electric motors has also been noticed visvis positive crop productivity india has emerged as the largest tractor producer in the world with about 08 million annual sales of tractors the farm mechanization dominated by tractor powered improved implements and machinery has improved timeliness and precision in field operations saved labor inputs and operation cost besides 20 higher yield the threshing of major crops is now completely mechanized and overall mechanization of primary processing of food grains is 682 india now produces a huge range of agricultural implements designed in the country with large pool of manufacturing industry icar designed and developed machines equipment and tools are also mass produced by the industries in the country these developments during last couple of decades contributed to achieve 47 overall farm mechanization of crop production in the country the needs of precision agriculture using artificial intelligence technologies is the emerging area for automated farm mechanization and post harvest operations this will bring precision while addressing the problem of scarcity of human labor formal research in the field of postharvest processing in india was initiated in third quarter of previous century with primary focus on minimizing postharvest crop losses and later transformed into development of agroprocessing technologies and valueadded food products creation of new ministry of food processing industries in 1988 provided impetus to developments in this sector icar has significantly contributed in development of mechanized processing and value addition of cotton jute and other fiber crops that facilitated significant amount of exports the utilization of crop residues and byproducts for animal feed production of organic manures and energy generation has taken a center stage during past decade the technological interventions and infrastructure development have reduced postharvest losses by 2 compared to period 200506 to 201314thereby saving about 30 mt of foods annually the demand of precision machinery equipment and instruments is continuously increasing a wide array of new technologies such as automated hardware and software autonomous ground vehicles drones gps guidance robotics sensors and telemetric clean and green energy sensorbased harvesting storage smart packaging nondestructive evaluation of food safety and quality are being developed with the improvements in smart technology and digitalization the future of agriculture machinery for food production and processing is highly promising large size of machines and their high operating costs are the major constraints for the small farms to switch from conventional farming to smart farming icars research focuses on development of affordable and reliable smart farm machines for small farmers the future technology needs to be portable plugnplay type with better chances to be successful and sustainable advanced mechanization systems will play a significant role in quality agriculture production and postharvest processing technologies for sustenance of agriculture in the future and ensuring not only food security but also nutritional securityindian agriculture after independence 2841 introduction agricultural mechanization both pre and postproduction has shifted from subsistence farming to robotics and artificial intelligence between the years 1900 and 2020 during the period from antiquity to around 1900 farming was done with manual labour with animal as power aid to some extent primitive and traditional artisan tools were used during this period tractors implements machinery and sprayers helped farmers during 1920 2010 through various research institutions table 1 to produce more with less effort after icar took over the technological laboratory of indian central cotton committee in mumbai jute technological research laboratory kolkata and indian lac research institute ranchi the agricultural engineering work started in 1950s with introduction of improved agricultural equipment and machinery the combine harvesters were introduced in northern india at the beginning of green revolution and their number grew from 800 in 19711972 to over 50000 at present the farm technologies pushed agriculture into the economic edge and produced lots of commercial crops that have established new agribusinesses or industrial agriculture after the year 2010 agricultural mechanization and postharvest processing entered the new age of technology called precision agriculture and postharvest processing precision technologies help judicious application of seeds fertilizers chemicals water etc similarly harvesting packaging transport storage processing and marketing using digital technology reduces the postharvest losses to minimum presently precision agriculture research is at initial stage and technologies such as sensor based embedded systems soil nutrient temperature fertility and moisture gradients guidance systems often enabled by gps gnss rfid variablerate input technologies vrts automated machinery automatic control and robots and advanced imaging technologies including satellite and drone imagery nir spectroscopy hyperspectral xray and magnetic resonance imaging are being developed to map the variability and to manage it during field operations threshing storage processing quality evaluation and safety assessment in market yards the new digital farming df or smart farming technology is focused on realtime agricultural data acquisition and decision making the digital farming also integrates the concepts of precision farming smart farming and a wide range of technologies most of them are having multiple applications along the agricultural value chain these technologies include cloud computingbig data analysis tools including block chain and smart contracts the internet of things

use of robots and different forms of artificial intelligence ai platforms that can gather large amount of data from public websites presently the ai based on machine learning ml and deep learning dl is not extensively used in indian agriculture for automatic data acquisition analysis decision making and controlling the various tasks using different algorithm and mathematical models the ai with computer vision and robotics is able to build nextgeneration agricultural equipment which can identify defects in fruits vegetables and fibres detect stresses in crops assess nutrient deficiencies in soil reduce chemical application and harvest high value crops there is a growing interest in applying ai to develop smart farming practices to minimize yield losses in crops by early warning and secondary agriculture for utilization of complete biomass of a particular crop and commodity for developing high value and low volume products for agroindustrialization and enhancing employment opportunities in the sector 2 farm mechanization the faster growth in mechanically powered equipment during past six decades significantly influenced crop productivity and established a direct correlation between farm power availability and food grain productivity the mobile farm power sources tractors draught animals power tillers combine harvesters as well as stationary power sources diesel engines and electric pumps have significantly contributed in growth of foodgrains productivity in india the percentage of agricultural workers to total workers in india declined from 591 in 1991 to 546 in 2011 and 394 in 2021 the draught animal population reduced from 7842 million in 197172 to 3874 million in 201819 resulting in reduction in the combined share of agricultural workers and draught animals in total farm power availability from 608 in 197172 to less than 10 in 201920 total farm power availability from all sources during 1960 was 03 kw ha 1 and it increased to 254 kw ha1 during 201920 fig 2 net sown area per tractor reduced from 487 hatractor in 197576 to 18 hatractor by 2019 20 as population of working tractors rose to 75 million in addition power tillers combine harvesters diesel engines and electric motors increased to the extent of 050 005 1150 and 750 million respectively the target of average farm power availability by 2030 is 40 kw ha 1 for timely and precise field operations indian agriculture after independence 286fig 2 power availability kw ha1 in agriculture over the years the current level of farm mechanization assessed for major cereals pulses oilseeds millets and cash crops indicate that the seedbed preparation is highly mechanized more than 70 and harvesting is the least mechanized at less than 32 about 65 of wheat area is mechanically sown but plantingtransplanting of sugarcane and rice are mechanized only up to 20 and 30 respectively harvesting and threshing of wheat and rice is 60 mechanized the harvesting of cottonjute fibre and lac crop is yet to be mechanized the overall mechanization level is 69 in wheat 50 in rice 45 in maize 41 in pulses 38 in oilseeds 35 in cotton and 33 in millets and sugarcane the overall farm mechanization level in the country is 47 much lower than china 595 and brazil 75 numerous machineryequipment for farm mechanization in independent india have been developed the wheat thresher and combine harvester commercialized during 1960s played critical role in the success of the green revolution the combine harvester also helped in timely harvesting of wheat during nationwide lockdown due to covid19 pandemic some machinery developments like laser leveler zero tillage equipment happy seeder and inclined plate planter have become very popular in recent years 3 irrigation soil and water engineering the demand for foodgrains in india is projected to be around 355 mt and 180 mt vegetables by 2030 and strategies to attain them are waterintensive india uses over 80 of its fresh water for agriculture the efficient use of which is paramount we also use water inefficiently through surface irrigation with an irrigation efficiency of about 40 microirrigation is an effective scientific alternative for higher irrigation efficiency of 7090 the evolution in micro irrigation during past two decades has broken the myth that this system is only applicable to wider spaced perennial horticultural fruit crops the microirrigation has made inroads in field crops like wheat sugarcane vegetables pulses etc in some of the nontraditional areas like sand dunes of western haryana micro irrigation made wheat cultivation possible in recognition of the importance of micro irrigation the government achievements in agricultural engineering in independent india 287laid larger emphasis on it since 1992 and launched a scheme in 2006 which later upgraded into the national mission on microirrigation in 2010 later in 2015 the microirrigation became the part of pm krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy fig 3 growth in the microirrigation over the years realizing the importance of more crop per drop and complementing the ongoing developmental initiatives in micro irrigation icar initiated research on microirrigation system for mango guava and ber orchards as early as in mideighties the infrastructure for testing of drip emitters and filters was created and large scale field demonstration installed on microirrigation systems and their overhead components for the benefit of farmers and other users of the technology subsurface drip lateral laying machine and trencher for installation of mainsubmain pipes were developed by icar the cumulative rd efforts enhanced the area under microirrigation from 090 million ha mha in 1998 to 1291 mha in 2021 4 postharvest processing and value addition 41 food crops the postharvest processing research in icar started primarily after starting icarall india coordinated research project aicrp on postharvest technology in 1972 and there was hardly any scientific data for postharvest losses during the period the hand operated winnowers were among the first primary processing equipment introduced during 195055 they were very popular for blowing away of lighter impurities after manual or animalassisted threshing this is the time when mechanized or industrialized rice milling was also introduced with cleaning and grading devices operated by motor or engines the hullers the main equipment used for milling of paddy were replaced by rubber roll sheller based rice milling during later years the equipment like air screen cleaners destoners specific gravity separators and other pneumatic devices for efficient cleaning grading of raw materials besides making them free from impurities like stones or metal scrap were indian agriculture after independence 288developed by icaraicrp on pht centres and icar institutes and introduced in primary processing of durable commodities especially food grains adoption of imported colour sorters for rice got initiated by 1990 the major technological interventions in the postharvest processing remained limited to the crops like cereals pulses and oilseeds and to a very limited extent in spices in case of durable commodities different types of mechanical and electricoperated grading devices were imported from europe america and japan and installed in the organizedsector processing plants during 1960s and 1970s most of the states enacted and enforced agricultural produce markets regulation apmr acts which introduced agricultural produce market committee apmc to frame the rules for marketing and standards for the sale of the produce under apmcs moisture content became an important quality standard of the produce initially moisture measurement was carried out mostly using oven drying method in 1980s the imported electronic moisture meters were introduced in food corporation of india fci and mandis and the resistance type moisture meters became popular among fci central warehousing corporation cwc state warehousing corporation swc which are still used with certain amount of calibration the bag in warehouse type storage was made popular since 1950s and fci cwc and swc helped in augmentation of storage capacity for food grains in recent past many privately owned warehouses have been constructed with support of the government this has helped in increasing the storage capacity during last one decade in organized sector drying has been one of the major methods for preventing postharvest losses the most economical method for drying is opensun drying use of plastic sheets for spreading of commodities for sun drying introduced in 1960s is still popular introduction of field dryers has been very limited to certain crops such as rice and some spices the lsu type dryer for drying of rice was introduced in 1980s with limited popularity inbin drying has been used very sporadically and could not be made much popular because the majority of food grains and pulses are stored in bags rather than in the bulk storage modules in the area of milling the flour making popularly known as attachakki rice milling dalmilling oilmilling and spice milling have become popular over time introduction of electric motor driven high capacity machines in place of manual grinding has been a major game changer in the grain milling the number of motor operated grain mills which was about 53000 by 1970 increased over five folds by 2000 roller flour mills were introduced in 1960s and their number reached to 200 by 1970 they became so popular that their number increased by 35 times by 2000 introduction of hammer mills increased versatility of the machines since they could also be used easily for variety of products including spices and also for wetgrinding in the decade of 1980 hammer mills of house hold capacity were introduced in the market variety of gadgets was in use in different parts of the country to mill rice from paddy by the year 2000 there were approximately 01 million hullersshellers and about 30000 modern rice mills in operation in the year 2016 achievements in agricultural engineering in independent india 289there were nearly 130 lakh modern rice mills in operation with significant contributions of icar scientists the mobile mini rice mills operated by tractor pto power take off have also been introduced in 2019 with input from icar institutions and collaborations with private companies stonesbased burr mills have been used traditionally for milling of pulses into dal emery roller millbased machines were introduced at the time of independence and by 1950 around 500 dal mills were in operation it was estimated during 2001 that there were around 12000 dal mills in operation the industry has been using custom made emery rollers for milling of dal and polishing of rice in 2002 icar introduced use of prefabricated emery stones for dal milling which is now popularized for both rice polishing and dal milling extraction of oil from oilseeds involved use of animal driven cold presses kachchi ghanis during preindependence and early postindependence periods gradual replacement of these with screw type oil expeller started in 1970s in 2018 there were approximately 15000 oil mills 600 solvent extraction plants 465 vegetable oil refineries and 250 hydrogenated vegetable oil vanaspati processing units in operation r d work of icar institutes in improvement of processing and machinery in these fields are commendable the perishable horticultural commodities were not processed traditionally at commercial level except for drying pickle making and some ready to eat products even the fresh products were handled in bamboo baskets gunny bags or transported bulk in open carts or carriers large scale adoption of plastic crates for handling of fruits and vegetables started in late 1990s whereas some fruits were packaged in wooden boxescrates the practice is still on the cardboard paper boxes were also introduced for packaging of grapes and some other fruits and vegetables in 1990s research and development on postharvest processing and value additions was in nascent stage for a long time in the country it started with opening of some agricultural engineering collegesdepartments in 1960s and actually has taken a lift during 1980s the first and second systematic studies on harvest and post harvest losses were carried out by icaraicrp on pht in 2006 and 2014 respectively and average postharvest losses in the ranges of 618 and 416 respectively in 2006 and 2014 were reported the third study for assessing harvest and postharvest losses is under way by ministry of food processing industries the interim reports not yet publicly available indicate that percent postharvest losses have further reduced significantly due to technological interventions infrastructural development and government policy implementations 42 fibre crops 421 cotton cotton is the most important commercial crop as it provides 59 of raw material to the indian textile industry and contributes 291 to the total textile exports in terms of value cotton contributes 49 to the value of agricultural output while the textile industry indian agriculture after independence 290contributes about 4 to the gdp in terms of exports raw cotton is exported to the tune of 5070 lakh bales while the textile industry is the largest exporter of cotton yarn 267 at the time of independence majority of domestic cotton production was short staple and almost 30 of our requirement was met through imports today we are the largest producer of cotton and the third largest cotton exporter in the world and more than 90 of cotton produced is of long staple icarcircot mumbai is a major technological partner in development of improved cotton varieties under aicrp on cotton and contributes to the development of technologies in postharvest processing of cotton mechanization in cotton cultivation and harvesting is at minimal level while at primary processing level it is almost 100 several value added products high value fabrics and machines for their processing have been developed and commercialized 422 jute and other natural fibres the first jute mill in india was established at rishra on the river hooghly near calcutta in 1855 when mr george acland brought jute spinning machinery from dundee uk four years later the first power driven weaving factory was set up by 1869 five mills were operating with 950 looms several issues and problems of jute were hindering the development of jute industries and therefore a jute technological research laboratory jtrl was established in 1939 in erstwhile calcutta in the nineties govt of india recognized importance of allied fibers and these were added in the mandate of jtrl and the institute was renamed as national institute of research on jute and allied fibres technology nirjaft field preparation seeding etc operations are almost fully mechanized mechanization level in harvesting is almost nil while primary processing levels are more than 90 recently numerous value added products of natural fibres especially from flax hemp and banana pseudostem have gained momentum in both national and export market 423 natural resins and gums nrg several forest products have significant importance in social and economic life in tropical areas nonwood forest products nwfps are more profitable than timber in the recent decades as a result of the international shift to multifunctional sustainable forest management the interest in nwfps has increased within this framework the promotion and utilization of nwfps is identified as a priority area by the fao the nrgs of commercial importance like lac mainly from kerria

agricultural research new delhi summary the first ever structured attempt to induce higher agricultural education based on scientific learnings and research came into being in india during 19011905 with 6 agricultural colleges established in different parts of the country later in 1929 the imperial council of agricultural research was established postindependence following the recommendations of the first joint indoamerican team 1955 the establishment of saus on the land grant pattern of usa took place since then agricultural higher education underwent several changes as number of state agricultural universities were established today india with 74 agricultural universities aus comprising state agricultural universities saus deemed universities dus and central agricultural universities caus is one of the largest agricultural research education and extension systems globally the uniformity assessment maintenance and strengthening of standards and quality of higher agricultural education through institutional mechanism has been put in place by icar for human resource development and quality reforms 1 introduction our ancient text viz bhagavadgita rig veda and atharva veda contain very specific details on agriculture like crops their cultivation manuring classification of herbs and information on different varieties of plants people started the agricultural practices such as ploughing sowing reaping and harvesting on auspicious days as these were linked with religious customs and also studied the nature of crops and plants through proper understanding of weather and monsoons unlike the modern techniques in ancient times indians used to perform yagnas or homas before farming which they believed helped them to increase yield krishi parashar krushi prasha1 with two hundred and fortythree verses is the theory of agriculture expounded in manner so as to benefit the farmers it mentions symbiotic relationship organic farming techniques crop management holistic farming or rather sustainable use of available resources vrikshayurveda nene 2012 means ayurveda which deals with the science of plant life such as procuring preserving and treating of seeds before planting selection of soil ph nourishments and fertilizers plant diseases and plant protection from internal and external diseases etcindian agriculture after independence 312the chenab colony served as the richest agricultural hub in punjab different innovative enhancements for example the utilization of high return assortments of seed more effective gear and apparatus enhanced water system framework better animals new methods of development eg a superior arrangement of pivot of harvests utilization of manure control and keeping away from yield maladies and a superior marketing framework for agrarian items existed new cash crop culture growing of tobacco sugar stick and cotton emerged the approach of the administration was exhaustive and the government was keen in the agricultural produce of the land and hence an agriculture college and research institute was established at lyallpur in 1909 now faisalabad pakistan the need for modern day higher agricultural education was felt after witnessing the impact of availability of trained human resources for technology driven increase in food grain production in the early years of green revolution this led the state governments to set up agricultural universities human resources have played an important role in attaining the selfsufficiency food security and surplus food grains in the face of continuous challenges an effective and functional higher education system is vital for building human capital and trained manpower for fore sighting of the emerging problems and provide matching cost effective solutions dr zakir hussain the then vicepresident of india at iari campus for the 2nd convocation address 1962 technology of dwarf varieties of wheat and rice modification of their grain characteristics according to the needs of our chapatti making and phenomenal rise in production of food grains leading to selfsufficiency was possible only due to the excellent collaborative efforts of agricultural scientists extension workers receptivity of farmers and policies of government therefore green revolution was the time in indias history during which began the introduction of technology and transformed agriculture into a modern agricultural achievements in agricultural education in independent india 313systems since then the trained human resources availability not only increased the production of food grains but also milk egg fish meat and vegetables and have played an important role in attaining the selfsufficiency food security and surplus food grains in the face of continuous challenges the need for an effective and functional higher education system was therefore considered vital for building human capital and trained manpower to meet the challenges that agricultural sector faces the major impact was that by 50 th anniversary of indias independence the yield revolution was observed and in wheat from 29 million ha of area under wheat cultivation in the country 96 million tons was produced swaminathan 2013 table 1 major milestones in higher agricultural education year milestone 1948 first university education commission of india to review all higher

the madras veterinary college was started in chennai to offer diploma and certificate course in veterinary and animal sciences later in 1903 it attained the status of a college and got affiliated to university of madras in 1936 the first ever structured attempt by british government for higher agricultural education was made during 19011905 when 6 agricultural colleges were established at coimbatore kanpur layallpur now in pakistan nagpur pune and sabour in 1927 bihar orissa veterinary college was established having the distinction of being the 5 th oldest veterinary college of undivided india the college started functioning from 7 april 1927 and became fully operational in 1930 and was known for its research in various branches of veterinary medicine and disease control in 1948 only 17 agricultural colleges 13 agriculture 3 veterinary and 1 agricultural engineering existed in india with facilities for training of only 160 postgraduate research students randhawa 1986 after independence a need was felt for a scientific and pragmatic policy to reconstruct higher education including agricultural practices this became imminent with the appointment of university education commission in 1948 by government of india the commission gave the concept of rural universities thereby opening the way for setting a new pattern for initiating agricultural education however the setting up of saus became a reality only after the recommendations of the first indoamerican team in 1955 relationship of indian agricultural universities with the u s land grant universities started with the usaid program that started in india in 1955 was on a regional basis for agricultural education the trend one agricultural university for each state took shape in 1960 and all aid support was on a state basis by the year 1968 there were eight agricul tural universities being assisted by the agency for international development through 6 us land grant institutions this universitytouniversity relationship became the bridge to scientific and cultural understanding between two great democracies these relationships achievements in agricultural education in independent india 315box 1 report of first indoamerican team set up universities on the land grant pattern education commission of india 1948 headed by s radhakrishnan had recommended setting up rural universities in india on american landgrant pattern as a solution to solve the problem of lack of university education in rural india the government of india in view of growing food shortages however approached united states technical cooperation mission for solution consequently a joint indo american team was constituted in 1954 tamboli and nene 2013 the team in its report submitted to the government in 1955 grant pattern as a solution to solve the problem of agricultural education the team recommended strengthening of post graduate teaching and research in agricultural subjects as well as effective coordination of agricultural education research and extension these recommendations laid the foundation for the creation of agricultural universities and research in agricultural sciences the contracts were signed with the 5 us land grant universities according to contracts each contracting us university had to work with agricultural colleges and research station in india for some definite period the task of mentoring the proposed university in up was assigned to the university of illinois the university was dedicated to the nation on 17 november 1960 illinois faculty served the university in designing its education system and putting in place an effective research and extension system for a period of 12 years singh 1999 in 1958 the second joint indo american team on agricultural education research and extension was appointed to frame proposals for third five year plan the team reinforced proposals to adopt land grant pattern with autonomous status integrating agriculture and allied areas as well as teaching research and extension the initial establishment of govind ballabh pant university of agriculture and technology gbpuat university brought about a revolution in agricultural education research and extension and it paved the way for setting up of 29 other state agricultural universities in the country by the year 1999 venkataraman 1999 were uttar pradesh agricultural university and the university of illinois punjab agricul tural university 1962 and the ohio state university university of udaipur 1962 and the ohio state university orissa university of agriculture and technology 1962 and the university of missouri andhra pradesh agricultural university 1964 and kansas state university jawaharlal nehru krishi vishwa vidvalaya 1964 and the university of illinois mysore university of agricultural sciences 1964 and the university of tennes see and maharashtra agricultural university 1968 and pennsylvania state university randhawa 1968 inauguration of the govind ballabh pant university of agriculture and technology pantnagar by the then prime minister pandit jawaharlal nehruindian agriculture after independence 316box 2 agricultural universities as harbinger of green revolution the importance of triple dwarf material of wheat was recognised by india and iari requested for the services of norman e borlaug in 1962the mexican wheat varieties developed by norman borlaug were tested in iari gbpuat and pau and new plant types to suit the needs of intensive agriculture and desirable qualities for indian bread making were repatterned in these institutions subsequently locally adaptable selections like kalyan sona and other improved varieties were released for farmers the kalyan sona variety of wheat was selected independently at pau ludhiana and iari from the material received from cimmyt mexico pau named it as kalyan and iari named it as sona all the three centres became a significant force in the development and transfer of high yielding variety seeds and related technology the gbpuat utilised its 16000 acres 65 km 2 of land to launch one of the largest seed production programs at that time under the brand name pantnagar seeds the contribution of the university was recognised by norman borlaug who described pantnagar as harbinger of green revolution through usaid and these us universities assistance was given for training of faculties of indian agricultural universities specialists from the u s universities serving with indian counterparts in teaching research and extension education all of these inputs participants specialists and equipment aided the indian agricultural universities to become real centers of new ideas and practices for indias agriculture box 3 strengthening of higher agriculture education in india the impact of aus on agricultural production during 196668 ie during green revolution convinced the states that innovative approach of linking research teaching and extension was needed in agriculture and hence during the period 19691978 fourteen new aus came into existence recognizing the importance of higher agricultural education each state subsequently established agricultural university originally established in 1905 at pusa bihar with the financial assistance of an american philanthropist mr henry phipps the indian agricultural research institute iari started functioning from new delhi since 1936 after its relocation following a major earthquake which damaged the institutes building at pusa bihar iari is the countrys premier institute for agricultural research education and extension it was given the deemedtobeuniversity status in 1956 by the ugc and to award masters and phd degrees in various agricultural disciplines mathura veterinary college established in 1947 became the first college to introduce the degree of bv sc ah currently there are 17 universities offering degree in various courses of veterinary and allied sciences the course on agricultural engineering leading to bachelor degree was initiated for the first time in 1942 at allahabad agriculture institute first exclusive fisheries college was established at mangalore in 1969 under the auspices of the university of agricultural sciences bengaluru from the very humble beginning agricultural universities now impart education in the various disciplines of agriculture viz agriculture agricultural engineering forestry horticulture veterinary and animal husbandry dairy science food technology fisheries science agribusiness management etc aus now impart education at the level of diploma degree masters and doctoral level achievements in agricultural education in independent india 3173 growth of agricultural education institutions the establishment of saus that started in 1960 with gbpuat being the first in the country picked up gradually and by 2001 almost all the major states except ne states had at least one sau some bigger states such as undivided bihar up maharashtra karnataka undivided mp and west bengal had two or more the number soared up to 74 in 2017 of which 63 are saus this happened partly due to creation of 3 new states in 2001 fig 2 while some states like gujarat rajasthan karnataka and up established fullfledged saus a new trend of establishing sectoral universities started cropping up consequently 4 universities for veterinary and animal sciences 2 in horticulture and one in fisheries were opened during 201217 in various states with the increase in universities the colleges in agricultural and allied science also increased substantially enabling access to agricultural education to a large number of students isap report 2020 fig 2 growth of state agricultural universities presently uttar pradesh has 9 aus and states of karnataka maharashtra and rajasthan have 6 aus each gujarat has 5 aus west bengal and haryana have 4 aus andhra pradesh bihar kerala madhya pradesh tamil nadu telangana each have 3 aus chhattisgarh himachal pradesh jammu kashmir punjab uttarakhand have 2 aus each and assam jharkhand manipur nagaland odisha delhi have only one au each fig 3 the number of constituent colleges increased with the increase in the number of aus while there were only 170 constituent colleges in 1996 the number increased to 227 in 200 further between 2006 and 2017 152 new constituent colleges were established making the number to 379 constituent colleges the concomitant increase in the number indian agriculture after independence 318of constituent colleges enabled access to higher agricultural education to a large number of students and the enrollment increased by over 16 in higher agricultural education within five years during 20122017 maximum increase was in agricultural colleges 42 followed by 11 new colleges in the discipline of horticulture and forestry the number of home science and agricultural engineering colleges has not increased to the similar extent the number of food science technology colleges remained relatively less despite tremendous scope for food processing and value addition the aus established during 196070 had strong departmentscolleges for basic sciences however most of the universities established later paid little attention to this discipline basic science discipline also needs special attention with the growth of agricultural education 4 reorganization of icar and establishment of division of agricultural education though icar aimed to undertake aid promote and coordinate agricultural education in the country however it had a very limited role before 1966 as it had neither financial resources nor statutory authority to discharge this responsibility in 1966 icar was reorganized and a fullfledged division of agricultural education was established to coordinate and support the development of aus randhawa 1986 the various fellowship schemes for staff development and student welfare were initiated icar developed first model act in 1966 to provide legal base for establishment functioning and uniformity of agricultural universities across aus makwana 2013 the quality assurance of higher agricultural education was given the major thrust through policy support accreditation academic regulation personnel policies review of course curricula and delivery systems development support for strengthening and creating infrastructure improvement of faculty competence and admissions through all india competitions the icar through its agricultural education division strives for maintaining and upgrading quality and relevance of higher agricultural education through partnership and efforts of the icaragricultural universities aus system in 1973 icar went through another major reorganisation the new department of agricultural research and education dare was created under ministry of agriculture to provide icar required linkages to deal directly with central and state governments as well as international organizations fig 3 distribution

technical and economic cooperation scholarship on agriculture has been initiated since 202122 for 6 fellowships each at master and phd students of agriculture of member nations 10 way forward the aus and icar institutes have been harbingers of the green and the rainbow revolutions and generating the muchneeded scientific manpower teachers technologies etc however there are issues of i declining financial resources in agricultural universities colleges opening of new institutions without matching resources and norms splitting of agricultural universities ii disconnect among agricultural education employment and industries requirements lack of adequate skill entrepreneurship and experiential learning and iii extensive inbreeding and slow pace of reforms singh et al 2019 system of evaluation monitoring impact assessment accountability etc needs improvement alongwith digitalization and governance in order to make the agricultural universities globally competitive availability of stateofthe art infrastructure highly qualified and trained faculty excellent research teaching and learning facilities and student amenities adequate financial support is therefore a prerequisite along with evolving appropriate models for strengthening of higher education addition of newer courses encompassing global initiatives 101 reforms in quality and academics to attract talent 1 the saus need to fare well among world ranked universities creation of world class universities will boost the countrys position in global rankings the country needs to reorient existing institutions into world class universities 2 expansion of the distance learning mode of education in agriculture in the nep2020 with blended model of curriculum transaction and more weightage to project work and experiential learning will be beneficial for wider reachachievements in agricultural education in independent india 3293 industrysaus linkages publicprivate partnership and other such models needs to be promoted for adequate resource mobilization from alternate sources so as to make the higher agri education institutions selfsustaining institutions 4 icarsau system should set up a mechanism for periodically assessing the absorption capacity of agriculture graduates and specialized post graduates in the various industries in india 5 the farming has been integrated over centuries so is the needs of the farmers as on date hence the process of fragmentation to open segmented saus should be reversed and the multifaculty nature and strength of saus should be restored 6 to attract students to agriculture and allied streams focus on developing professional opportunities in production processing marketing and supply of agricultural products besides generating new employment opportunities 7 in order to strengthen degree programmes in the emerging and frontier areas of science and technology more fellowships need to be earmarked separate provision of special research grants should be extended for innovative pg research 8 establishing technology parks and agribusiness hubs agribusiness innovation centres would serve as innovation platforms and also encourage rural graduates entrepreneurs and young professionals to start businesses and bring technological and managerial expertise to rural areas 9 institutionalize skill development entrepreneurship and experiential learning programmes and invest on nonformal education and vocational training in agricultural technologies 10 introducing innovations introduction of upcoming and relevant areas in course cur riculum initiating new courses in education should be a regular practice 11 disciplines of social sciences like economics agribusiness management marketing and rural sociology and agricultural ethics and policies need to be emphasized for promoting marketdriven agriculture 12 introduction of diversified creditbased degree system instead of fixed duration system and credit transferability shall enhance opportunities to students to pursue their academic interests 102 faculty improvement 1 improving faculty in terms of strength and competence must be recognized as key factor for reinforcing quality in current education system the components like postdoctoral fellowship visiting faculty adjunct faculty should be encouraged in addition opportunities for physical exchange of facultyspecialists creation of necessary infrastructure for teachers training at nationalinternational centres indian agriculture after independence 330 prime minister shri rajiv gandhi delivering the convocation address at iari new delhi prime minister shri manmohan singh in the convocation ceremony of iari new delhiachievements in agricultural education in independent india 3312 inviting overseas accomplished professors and researchers to indian aus and research institutes for varying periods of time for imparting training in frontal areas interaction on curriculum development and education technology would lead to capacity development of a large number of faculty and students besides formulation and initiation of research programs in frontier areas 11 conclusion although the support and interventions from icar has significantly strengthen the amenities encouraged skill development capacity building of faculty and has helped students be ready for industry and better placements improved publications accreditation process has led many states to expedite the recruitment process in saus it is very important that additional new challenges faced by agriculture are reflected in national curricula and research priorities agriculture has to economically viable globally competitive socially equitable and environmentally sustainable and all these facts must be internalized in curricula agricultural education should engage in global social contract to serve the needs of the society build leadership increase collaboration develop new approaches to deal with challenges therefore it is necessary to undertake human capacity building for developing professionals and entrepreneurs in emerging new areas of specialization in addition all aus have sufficient land available for experimentation demonstration of various trials to farmers etc but it is important that all aus should develop and evolve ways for adequate resource generation and convert themselves into selfgoverning institutions which is also reflected in the new education policy references agnihotri mk rana n singh sp sharma k and kumar a 2014 talent for responsive agriculture education division

extension in independent india ak singh1 r roy burman2 vp chahal1 randhir singh1 and keshav1 1indian council of agricultural research new delhi 2icarindian agricultural research institute new delhi summary agriculture in india has a typical blend of man machine animal and material usage and influenced by the behavioral changes when population was less single crop in a season with grazing animals and least use of machines and material inputs was a reality rather than exception as we grew in numbers and in ambitions the intensive use of man machine and material started with less use of animals the mantoman interface structured or unstructured played a catalytic role in this evolution of agriculture the agricultural extension system in india evolved through phases firstly it helped in the intensive use of inputs and dwarf varieties of rice and wheat hybrids of maize and other coarse cereals for food security the community development programme in 1950s intensive area development programme tv programme lab to land programme in 1970s and oilseeds pulses promotional programme in 1980s microirrigation and farm mechanizations 1990s onwards and more intensively post mgnrega are the critical endeavors done by the agricultural extension system in the past that shaped todays technology and skill intensive agriculture agricultural extension helped reducing the gaps in potential yields and farm realized yields while the course of informal extension from farmers to farmers changed to farmers and stateowned subsidized input providing units located at the block headquarters and below and private input dealers the formal extension bifurcated into mass extension machineries owned by state department of agriculture and frontline extension under the umbrella structure of nars led by icar during 1970s this innovation proved the most productive for many out of the box solutions like national demonstrations programme on hyvs technology mission on oilseeds accelerated pulses development programme seed hub programme etc which helped ensuring technology dissemination on a large scale the farmers knowledge base and the capabilities for adoption of improved agricultural technologies and innovations improved substantially the unique set up of krishi vigyan kendras kvks started in 1974 has proved one of its kind and the only gateway of frontline technologies in the district of late these kvks are engaged in much complex deliverables related to climate change nutrisensitive agriculture resource conservation special drives for disadvantaged and aspirational districts in india for agriculture and water resources while this split proved very successful in the previous years this chapter discusses the evolution of agricultural extension system over the last 75 years that transformed indian agriculture indian agriculture after independence 3341 introduction the agricultural extension system in india has two broad typologies based on their domain of action mass extension or field extension system and frontline extension system philosophically the field extension system is concerned with dissemination of established agricultural technologies to the masses by development departments and agencies and the frontline extension system concerns to testing and demonstration of new technologies in a quick succession differently in approach and design which otherwise take very long gestation period to reach to the farmers as well as capacity development of the related stakeholders the overall financial governance of frontline extension system is under icar with saus some reputed ngos state governments providing the lead role in the states and districts apart from the frontline extension the mass extension in agriculture allied sectors is under the governance of department of agriculture farmers welfare dafw department of fisheries department of animal husbandry dairying and the related ministries of rural development through their network of agricultural and related departments at state district block and village level the commodity boards under the ministry of commerce also provide mass extension services specific to their commodities the agribusiness houses and input agencies albeit some conflict of interest offer private extension services to farmers frontline extension is a catalytic force for bringing desirable behavioural change which involves a higher level of knowledge sharing and interaction by qualified resource persons of the research and educational system the basic philosophy behind frontline extension system is that the scientists who have generated the technologies can demonstrate their technologies better to the farmers in their fields with concurrent and direct feedbacks to them for further refinement in the technology 2 role of agricultural extension in addressing agrarian challenges a number of social workers and philosophers with a philanthropic intent in the pre independence period came forward for overall development of society through rural reconstruction and upliftment of underprivileged sections of the society the attempts such as sriniketan project sevagram marthandam project gurgaon project firka development programme are some important to cite these were important movements but operated in isolation the role of extension in addressing agrarian challenges has changed over the decades table 1 the major dynamic role of extension affecting agriculture and the rural society is given below table 1 milestones in agricultural extension in india

to bring food sufficiency by leveraging and rejuvenating the indian agricultural research and extension system the community development programme provided a fillip to the philosophy of working on a model of land grant pattern of agricultural education and extension this was the time when integrated system of agricultural researcheducation and extension was christened the need for stepping up food production was realized even in the preindependence era and growmorefood campaign was started for increased agricultural production on a pan india approach the campaign failed to achieve its targets and was redefined by the government soon after the independence in 1947 to achieve selfsufficiency in food grains by 1952 with simultaneous increase in the targets of production of other crops an integrated and coordinated approach was adopted in the entire campaign for increasing agricultural production some state governments mobilized the public support in the campaign by setting up of peoples committees at the village taluka district and state levels 211 etawah pilot project in 1948 mr albert mayer of usa who came to india as a warrior at a village called mahewa in uttar pradesh started pilot project for development of etawah district in up the project governance was designed in a way that development officers got posted at every critical level of facilitation down to village level the multipurpose village level worker vlw achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 337was assigned the responsibility of four or five villages the entire project was sponsored and funded by the government of uttar pradesh the most convincing achievement of this project was in agriculture particularly in wheat production due to adoption of improved production technologies this project solved the problem of unemployment and under employments 212 nilokheri project this project started during 1948 under the leadership of sh sk dey with the primary objective of developing a new township to rehabilitate displaced people from west pakistan the project was built in a swampy barren land by refugees with selfhelp and governments assistance located around the vocational training centre on the highway of delhi and ambala the scheme called mazdoor manzil was launched for construction of township at nilokheri this scheme provided the people i training on agricultural implements preparation ii cottage industries and iii carpentry etc the nilokhari project was a suitable blend of selfsufficiency in all essential requirements of rural cum urban life later this township was handed over to the government of punjab and went to haryana after bifurcation of punjab 213 community development project in order to increase agricultural production and bettering the overall economic condition of the farmers 55 community development projects were started in different parts of the country on 2nd october 1952 for three years the projects covered nearly 25260 villages and a population of 64 million each project in turn consisted of about 300 villages covering 400500 square miles and having a population of about two lakhs the project area was divided into three development blocks each comprising 100 villages and a population of 60000 to 70000 the development blocks in turn were divided into groups of 510 villages each group being in the charge of a multipurpose villagelevel worker field day on mechnical transplanting of paddy in sangrur punjabindian agriculture after independence 338214 national extension service nes the national extension service was inaugurated on 2nd october 1953 the scheme of national extension service was designed to provide the essential basic staff and a small fund for the people to start the development work essentially on the basis of selfhelp the operational unit of this service was an nes block comprising about 100 villages and 60000 to 70000 people the nes blocks were later converted into community development blocks which had higher budget provisions in order to take up more intensive development programmes the pattern of community development programme was further revised modified with effect from 1st april 1958 215 national demonstration a nationwide programme of demonstrations known as national demonstration on major food crops was launched in 1964 it was a nationwide project with a uniform design and pattern there was a specific yield target and there was no separate control plot the area of the demonstration plot was about one hectare the farmers in whose plots the demonstrations were laid out were the actual cultivators with small holdings the agricultural scientists conducted these demonstrations in association with local extension agenciesworkers the national demonstrations were intended to show the superiority of the demonstrations to the extension agencies 216 high yielding variety programme hyvp the hyvp was launched in 1966 as an integrated programme to introduce the high yielding crop varieties and promote the modern agricultural inputs like fertilizers irrigation plant protection improved implements etc this aimed at attaining selfsufficiency in food production the hyvp proved pivotal to realise the green revolution in the country as the programme created demand for the new varieties the agricultural scientists successfully evolved new high yielding varieties in cereals particularly in wheat rice and maize the part of indogangetic plain in the states of punjab haryana and up western part were the original area where this programme got implemented initially the pervasive influence of high yielding technology spread to other area as of farm production such as animal production fishery sericulture social forestry etc 22 era of food sufficiency 19752000 post green revolution the period between 1975 to 2000 saw adequacy of staple food grains and food security ensured barring deficiency of few commodities however some glaring problems cropped up the most serious was depleting natural resources and declining factor productivity the sustainability issues caught the eyes of all concerned and demand for food security along with focus on input use efficiency land and labour productivity as well as their use optimization escalated resultantly more systematised efforts of field extension programmes sponsored by department of agriculture cooperation were launched for all major commodities to support technology delivery and dissemination and achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 339capacity building of farmers as well as extension professionals the following programs were launched which had a different role for extension personnel to play 221 training and visit tv system the tv system was the brainchild of dr daniel benor world bank consultant and introduced in india in 1974 for all round development of agricultural extension system in the country the programmes aimed to have direct observation of the farmers fields training and technology transfer to the farmers and extension workers so as to enable them achieving greater productivity and production rajasthan and west bengal were the first states to introduce the programme in 1974 which later spread to 16 states the dynamic link between farmers professional extension workers and researchers created through the tv system of extension contributed significantly in effective technology transfer through scientific means and ultimately higher food production 222 technology assessment and refinement tarinstitution village link age programme ivlp in 1995 icar launched this innovative programme to introduce technological interventions with emphasis on stability and sustainability along with productivity of smallfarm production systems the programme ensured introduction and integration of appropriate technologies to sustain technological interventions and their integration to maintain productivity and profitability taking environmental issues into consideration in a comparatively welldefined farm production system marketable surplus in commercial on and off farm production system facilitate adoption of appropriate postharvest technologies for conservation and onfarm value addition of agricultural products byeproducts and waste for greater economic dividend and national priorities and adoption of appropriate technologies for removal of drudgery increased efficiency and higher income of farm women later on the project was upscaled at 70 centres with funding from natp 223 national agricultural technology project the national agricultural technology project natp was launched by the indian council of agricultural research icar on june 30 1998 with the support of the world bank to strengthen and complement the existing resources and to augment the output of the national agricultural research system nars the natp was the worlds biggest world bank assisted agriculture project worth rs 992 crores developed and executed by nars the lifespan of natp was seven years from 1998 to 2005 natp was the first project in nars to shift the focus from disciplineoriented research to production system research the natp was the first project in nars to involve competitive funding and have pluralistic approach to involve and fund partners from outside nars natp successfully completed a whopping total of 852 projects under natp there was a separate component on innovations in technology dissemination itd as part of itd agricultural technology management agencies atmas were piloted in 28 districts and indian agriculture after independence 34044 agricultural technology information centres atics were set up in icar institutes and state agricultural universities 23 era of food surplus 2000 onwards at present india is not only selfsufficient in food production but also and the net exporter of food grains and several other commodities this is a matter of great satisfaction to agricultural research extension system but alongside the new cyclic and structural challenges of indian agriculture has enlarged the price discovery and realization is the most crucial cyclic problems and land fragmentation is the biggest structural issue in indian agriculture today this calls for enhancing productivity of land labour and applied inputs addressing gender and nutritional issues reducing postharvest losses and food wastes attracting rural youth in agriculture with entrepreneurship development and business incubation and managing the perpetual problem of natural resource degradation and depletion under the realm of escalating abiotic stresses while many developmental and research programmes were launched for far reaching impacts the extension system has also undergone a paradigm shift the krishi vigyan kendra continued to be the knowledge and resource centre at the district level and playing a crucial role of location specific technology development and technology backstopping for the development departments or field extension system other than kvks the following programmesprojects of both frontline and field extension played important role in technology delivery and dissemination 231 agricultural technology information centre atic as part of innovations in technology dissemination itd component of natp the agricultural technology information centres atic were established in the year 2000 these atics serve as a single window delivery system for services and products of research for the areas in which the concerned institute is involved at present there are 44 atics established in icar institutes and saus 232 national agricultural innovation project the national agricultural innovation project naip was launched in the year 2006 by icar the overall objective of naip is to facilitate the accelerated and sustainable transformation of indian agriculture in support of poverty alleviation and income generation through collaborative development and application of agricultural innovations by the public organizations in partnership with farmers groups the private sector and other stakeholders 3 frontline extension the postindependence extension programmes and interventions were more organised and systematic icar started major frontline extension projects viz national demonstration project 196465 operational research project 1972 and labtoland project 1979 another significant development in frontline extension was the establishment of krishi vigyan kendras kvks in 1974 achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 341the activities of all the three previously launched frontline extension programmes ie nd orp and llp were merged with kvks these kvks were aimed to improve technical literacy of farmers including rural women on the principle of learning by doing and teaching by doing these kvks are currently established and hosted by the icar institutes state agricultural universities saus and nongovernmental organisations ngos government departments with financial support and guidance from the icar mushroom unit 31 genesis of krishi vigyan kendras kvks the education commission 196466 recommended that a vigorous effort be made to establish specialized institutions to provide vocational education in agriculture and allied fields at the pre and postmatriculate levels to cater to the training needs of a large number of boys and girls coming from rural areas the icar mooted the idea of establishing kvks farm science centres as innovative institutions for imparting vocational training to the practicing farmers school dropouts and field level extension functionaries the first kvk on a pilot basis was established in 1974 at puducherry pondicherry under the administrative control of the tamil nadu agricultural university coimbatore the planning commission approved the proposal of the icar to establish 18 kvks during the fifth five year plan period 197479 in the year 198384 cabinet had decided to open one kvk in each district since then several new kvks were established by icar during each 5 year plan period on the occasion of the independence day speech on 15th august 2005 the prime minister of india announced that by the end of 2007 there should be one kvk in each of the rural districts of the country by the end of the tenth plan 200207 the number of kvks grew to 551 so far the icar has established 731 kvks across the country and these are hosted by different agencies such as agriculturalveterinary universities deemed universities state governments ngos public sector undertakings and other educational institutions indian agriculture after independence 342fig 1 growth of the kvk network in india in different fiveyear plans the kvks have emerged as critical frontline extension innovation in testing demonstration and dissemination of agricultural technologies the mandate of kvk is technology assessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development in addition good quality seeds planting materials livestock strains bioproducts etc are produced and supplied to the farmers for the effective adoption the kvk system has played a key role in transfer of modern and emerging technologies in agriculture and allied sectors leading to increase in production and productivity development of high value agriculture like horticulture livestock and fisheries introduction of newer varieties for pulses and oilseeds leading to increase in income of farmers and promotion of farmbased enterprises as technology transfer on large scale is the responsibility of the state line departments and atma kvks are playing key role in supporting and guiding field extension activities agricultural technology management agency atma is currently operational in 639 districts of 28 states and 3 uts the atma provides an institutional mechanism for coordination and management of agricultural extension system in the district the kvk function as a frontline extension system and atma as a field extension agency 4 major extension approaches for priority areas extension has renewed itself in many facets as compared to its primordial land grant college pattern of education and top to bottom approach of technology transfer over a period of time the agricultural extension has reoriented itself from production productivity to income and marketing efficiency pedagogic education system to onthejob vocational training decentralized bottom to top approach resource exploitation to sustainable agricultural practices etc the past experiences and learnings from programmes within india and achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 343overseas have contributed to change in the form function and approach of presentday extension the broad contours of the present approaches to extension are discussed in following para 41 farmer participatory approach the entire philosophy behind this approach is to make the farmers active participants at every stage of project formulation and implementation rather than passive recipients of subsidized agricultural inputs and other incentives many of the past projects either failed or could not sustain once the government support was withdrawn simply because of lack of farmers participation farmer participation is required for problem diagnosis process implementation monitoring and evaluation and provision of feedback the traditional knowledge and technologies are to be identified and technologies are to be developed keeping in mind the local conditions for this a strong partnership between farmer and extension agent is imperative 42 paraprofessional based services paraextension workers can supplement the traditional frontline extension system in relatively costeffective manner they can also work better at the grassroots level if provided with public funding support and capacity building empowering farmers to get control over their own lives and requirements has become essential in the present context a number of efforts are being taken to empower farmers across the country which is discussed below 421 formation of farmer interest group fig the main objective behind the group approach is to establish a simple and farmer oriented participatory extension mechanism which enable the government to reach large number of farmers to empower the small farmers with limited resources the group and farmers led extension approaches like formation of commodity interest groups cigs and farm schools are gaining momentum under the centrally sponsored scheme on support to state extension programmes for extension reforms under implementation since 200506 in all the states and uts in a cig which is selfmanaged independent group of farmers having shared goal and interest the members pool their existing resources to get better access to other resources and also share the benefits the institutions of cigs farmers interest groups figs and farmers federation also empower farmers to decide their own price of their commodities and bargain with the traders while its marketing 43 farmer field school the farmer field school ffs a season long onfield training module developed by fao nearly 25 years ago in southeast asia as an alternative to the prevailing topdown extension methods which sometimes do not work in complex and counterintuitive problem like pesticideinduced pest outbreaks in a typical ffs a group of 2025 farmers meet once a week in a local field setting under the guidance of a trained facilitator the learningbyindian agriculture after independence 344doing approach promotes farmbased experimentation group organization and decision making ffs programmes have diversified including multiple crops and livestock farmer involvement in the design and planning of interventions was found to be critical the ffs farmers gain more knowledge in pest and nutrient management and actively exercise interpersonal networks to share knowledge among themselves but very little with other farmers involve in joint decision making and group capacity building based on learning outcomes the best change in the behavioral aspect is that the knowledge can be translated into practice in farming kumar et al 2022 ffs programmes increasingly relied on farmers as ffs facilitators short training duration for ffs facilitators raised concern about ffs quality even though mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation were mostly in place capacity for data analysis and data utilization were a concern van den berg et al 2020 44 private agricultural extension system in india the private sector involved in agribusiness plays active role in agricultural extension although the conflict of interest cannot be ruled out it adds to fill the gap in input delivery and customised advisory services these largely sector include seed and input companies distributors and agrodealers service providers food processors and retailers and the content providers for agroadvisories the legal commitments under contract farming does include among other the technical backstopping and quality inputs and thus important vehicle for agricultural extension there are an estimated 282000 input dealers in india which help communities in rural or semirural areas and have interest in offering quality services to their farmer clients ferroni and zhou 2011 several of private companies like mahindra mahindra itc dcm shriram ltd tata kisan sansar rallis etc have their own extension wings to reach out to farmers primarily for the promotion of their products the tata chemicals kisan sansar tks launched in 2002 has made an innovative contribution in developing the rural scenario by providing technology information and crop advisory services to empower the farmers along with agricultural inputs it operates on the model of hub and spoke presently 32 hubs cater to 681 spokes covering around 22000 villages and approximately 35 million farmers these tks are spread across 88 districts in 7 northern and eastern states in india over 300 tks spokes are running successfully in uttar pradesh alone mukherjee 2011 as the interest for a particular brand always prevail amongst the dealers of a particular company the conflict of interest and push factor for the product irrespective of farmers needs is the major drawback of this system the contradictory messaging by many agencies driven by selfinterest may also create confusion to the farmers 5 innovations in agricultural extension with the gradual change in the context of technology application at farmers fields a number of new concepts and models research and extension are being evolved the important innovations are discussed below achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 34551 farmer producer organizations fpos this innovation is the prime mover for addressing the structural problem of land fragmentation and prevalence of unviable small and marginal farm households in india this concept safely adopts the aggregation of produce over pooling of land or compromise on physical boundary of the farmers piece of land these organizations by virtue of backward aggregation bulk purchase of inputs for 1000 or more farmers of fpos and forward aggregation of output or marketing ensure the muchneeded bargaining edge to farmers with input dealers for reduced cost and with the big players in the market for remunerative price of their produce the cooperative principle underlying the fpos makes them democratic thus overcoming tyranny of big farmers the producer organizations po of primary producers viz farmers milk producers fishermen weavers rural artisans craftsmen are also forming producer companies provide sharing of profitsbenefits among the members kvks have a meaningful role in capacity development of fpos providing technology backstopping handholding in business incubation etc association of fpos in different states are also being supported by the icar institutes and kvks 52 diploma in agricultural extension services for input dealers daesi agriinput dealers having one of the largest networks globally are an important source of information related to agricultural inputs and activities to the farming community besides the supply of inputs and informally the credit majority of them do not possess formal agricultural education in order to improve their competency in agriculture to serve the farmers better as para extension professionals national institute of agricultural extension management manage has initiated a selffinanced oneyear diploma in agricultural extension services for input dealers daesi program during the year 2003 with a course fee of rs 20 000 based on the very positive and encouraging response the government decided to extend this programme in all the states the program is implemented by manage through state agricultural management and extension training institutes sametis agricultural universities aus and kvks the department of agriculture farmers welfare incentivize the course fee by 50 and up to rs 10000 per input dealer 53 climatesmart extension climate change has caused many setbacks and demands concerted efforts for solving some of the multifaceted issues spread across several departments and ministries so far as governance is concerned the sustainability has emerged as major concern and challenge in the wake of its impact onfarm production systems and resource base such complex situation demands smart decisions and approach well interwoven with the active participation of researchers extension practitioners farmers and developmental organizations to develop and design the techniques to combat mitigate and adapt to risks generated due to climate change under national innovations on climate resilient agriculture nicra climate resilient technologies applications were carried out with several institutional reforms and community indian agriculture after independence 346led interventions total 151 climate smart villages crvs were developed that consists of implementing the resilient practices at a scale to cover the entire village in a saturation mode depending on the resource endowments of the farmers with one or several interventions for imparting resilience to the production systems the number and kind of interventions implemented are largely determined by the resources available and vulnerability status and involvement of communities 531 promoting climate resilience in agriculture icar initiative on climate resilient agriculture was scaled up from 121 villages in 2018 to 446 villages in 202021 total climate resilient practices tailored to context and location specific situation under 4 modules were demonstrated by 121 kvks during 201820 as many as 30971 participatory demonstrations on nrm 24737 demonstrations on resilient practices of short duration droughtflood tolerant cultivars crop diversification and resilient cropping systems and interventions covering 637890 livestock and fisheries 4101 trainings covering 76775 farmers 7575 extension activities covering 141544 farmers were conducted by the kvks the model attracts traction of states in india and in saarc countries maharashtra put the model in 5000 villages under world bank funded project on climate resilient agriculture pocra and saarc initiated consortium for scaling up climate smart agriculture in south asia csucses through climate change food security ccafsindia in in its 8 member states nabard entered into an mou with icar for climate proofing of nabard watersheds 54 farmer first programme ffp farmer first provides an opportunity for the researchers extension personnel and farmers to work together under this scheme the research initiative is decided based on need and interest of farmers where scientists role is of facilitators the project is being implemented at 52 centres across the country covering about 45000 farm families 55 attracting and retaining youth in agriculture arya arya initiative of icar was undertaken in 25 districts initially to develop a comprehensive model to attract and empower the youth in rural areas to take up various agriculture allied and service sector enterprises for sustainable income and gainful employment the programmes also aimed at enabling the farm youth to establish net work groups to take up resource and capitalintensive activities like processing value addition and marketing and demonstrate functional linkage with different institutions and stake holders for convergence of opportunities available under various schemesprogrammes for sustainable development of youth over 42000 youth have been facilitated by kvks in 25 districts the project is planned to be extended to another 75 districts making the total districts under this initiative to 100achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 34756 mera gaon mera gaurav my village my pride the essence of this program is incorporating direct delivery of scientific technology and practice to farming community under mgmg the scientists of icar institutes adopt villages and introduce the technologies developed by icar in the villages a team of four scientists adopt a cluster of five villages based upon proximity and make regular visits to the villages and extend technical guidance to the farmers multidisciplinary teams of scientists of icar institutes and state agricultural universities saus have covered 13500 villages this is a unique model for ensuring frequent farmerscientist interface for developing personal rapport knowledge sharing facilitating linkage with development departments and agencies and generates and share feedback 57 nutrisensitive agricultural resources innovations nari agriculture sector growth has contributed mainly to economic growth in india over the past several decades but improvements in nutrition remains a major concern nari is focused on empowering farm women with key areas like innovative practices to promote nutrition sensitive agriculture awareness and capacity development of various stakeholders value chain literacy campaign etc this will encourage intensive exchange of knowledge good practices and governance related issues to evolve a systematic policy framework for agricultural extension systems to promote nutritionsensitive agriculture through a network of kvks madhya pradesh became the third state in the country after tamil nadu and rajasthan to provide wholesome meal to poor at affordable price rs 5 with the launch of deendayal thali in 49 out of 51 districts window to news 2017 58 knowledge system homestead agriculture management in tribal areas kshamta keeping a view the importance of the tribal agriculture the icar has thought of initiating another programme called knowledge system for homestead agriculture management in tribal areas kshamata in 125 districts where tribal population is 25 or more to facilitate technology support and related inputs to the tribal farmers located in remotest places and have proved to be the nearest to the farming community for technical know how and do how on crop livestock and enterprisebased livelihood related activities resulting in socioeconomic empowerment and sustainable livelihood security of the tribal farmers 59 value addition and technology incubation centre in agriculture v ati ca value addition and technology incubation centre in agriculture v atica has been conceptualized by icar to create a facility to provide incubation training to rural youth in processing and value addition icar on its own funding support will create 34 units as model units in the kvk campuses kvks are strategically located and linked with agricultural universities and icar institutes to identify different trades and establish tradespecific value addition and incubation centres for educating youth and the farmers to indian agriculture after independence 348practice various components of technology management at the incubation centres and with the support from different lending agencies they can establish their own processing and value addition units for commercial purposes 510 ictbased extension digital application in agriculture is the need of the hour given the penetration of mobile technology deeper in the disadvantaged and underprivileged geographies of the country with the focus on hitech automated precision agricultural systems digital tools and technologies eg remote sensing automation irrigation devices information communication technologies icts have been proving promising to farmers in different ways from production to marketing the ict has not only made it easy to deliver the farm advisories to millions of the farmers but escalated the quality of the extension system with complimentary effects ict initiatives such as webbased portals eg agrisnet dacnet agmarknet kiosks eg vkc echoupal tele centers isro vrc callbased kisan call centers iksl mobile applications pusa krishi app mkrishi mkisan video based digital green initiative etc have been acknowledged globally for their access and reach mass media and ict tools help to reach out the farmers at remotest corners of the country in costeffective and timely manner some of the pathbreaking ict initiatives are discussion worthy 5101 mkisan the mkisan farmers portal was developed in 2012 by the ministry of agriculture government of india the information about seeds fertilizers pesticides farm machinery weather market price of farm produce package of practices programmes and schemes insurance storage credit minimum support price are provided in local language sms portal was inaugurated by the honble president of india on july 16 2013 and since its inception nearly 327 crore messages through more than 1044 crore smss have been sent to farmers in the country more than 90 lakh farmers are being provided advisory by the kvks these messages are specific to farmers needs relevance at a particular point of time and generate heavy inflow of calls in the kisan call centres where people call up to get supplementary information this portal has enabled centre and state departments of agriculture allied sectors saus kvks agromet forecasts units icar institutes to provide informationservicesadvisories to farmers in their language 5102 dd kisan and community radio a dedicated television channel on agriculture dd kisan was launched in 2015 to supplement and compliment technology dissemination through need based agricultural programmes government of india approved a policy to grant licenses for community radio stations crs in december 2002 the programmes are produced by the local people in their local dialect educational institutions kvkssausicar institutes and ngos community based organizations cbos are establishing the crs saus and kvks have achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 349also established crs it benefits farmers within the radius of broadcast of crs 5103 kisan sarathi the kisan sarathi platform was launched on 16 july 2021 jointly by the union minister for agriculture and farmers welfare and the union minister of electronics information technology on the occasion of 93rd foundation day of icar it is an interactive digital platform to facilitate farmers to get right information at right time in their desired language it will help farmers to avail personalized advisories on agriculture and allied areas directly from the respective scientists of krishi vigyan kendras kvks farmers can also learn new farming methods using it 5104 mobile apps the mobile phone technology which is comparatively new form of ict provides the electronic capabilities reaches to customer provides privacy anytime and anywhere contactless services and most preferred user carry personal item nierinck 2008 several commodity institutes of icar across the country have developed the farmerfriendly mobile apps for crops like chickpea rice millets sodic soil management etc the kvks have also developed 117 mobile apps as per specific requirements of their district which are gaining popularity among farmers and other user categories these apps offer valuable information about package of practices of different crops horticulture veterinary dairy fisheries education market prices of various commodities weather related information advisory services etc these apps are contributing significantly to production and productivity of farmers and can boost farming in india further it is solving problems of farmers at doorstep providing information about various schemes and improve their livelihoods and awareness 6 successful frontline extension achievements of kvks farmercentric approach of kvk scheme of icar enabled adoption of an array of sciencebased initiatives for greater outreach and higher impact 61 enhancing production and productivity of pulses through cluster front line demonstration cfld the country was deficient in pulses with production around 1617 million tons mt up to 201516 in order to harness the potentials of the improved technologies on pulses productivity 590 kvks embarked upon heavily to demonstrate the technology package comprising of improved variety seed treatment weeds pests and diseases management in farmers fields through cluster frontline demonstrations the productivity enhancement in the cluster demonstration ranged between 3040 22 to 39 q ha 1 in major pulse crops which resulted in production of over 25 mt in a short period quality seed was the driver of production as 151 seed hubs established at kvks 97 made available 79725 q certified seed of high yielding pulses cultivars to farmers during 201820 coupled with the price indian agriculture after independence 350signals and other policy initiatives these cluster frontline demonstrations proved catalytic to boost the productivity ushering into pulses revolution and making country near self sufficient in pulses production 62 kadaknath poultry rearing initiative of kvk jhabua spreads to 20 states kadaknath is an important indigenous breed of poultry inhabiting vast areas of western madhya pradesh mainly the jhabua and dhar districts and adjoining areas of gujarat and rajasthan uniqueness of kadaknath desi breed is its richness of protein and unique characteristic of meat quality kvks in tribal dominated areas in madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh established hatcheries for promoting scientific rearing of kadaknath in the region promotion of kadaknath breed by kvks led to its spread across 20 states promotion of better rearing practices in back yards as freerange poultry in existing orchards and commercial production for higher economic returns catapulted the indigenous breed to a wellrecognized brand 63 mass campaign to mitigate crop residue management burning of paddy crop residue in punjab haryana and uttar pradesh causes a lot of environmental issues as well as loss to organic carbon microbes and nutrients to address this problem a programme on crop residue management crm was initiated in these states through kvks in collaboration with state departments of agriculture an information education and communication iec mechanism was built along with creation of custom hiring centres operated by farmers and farmers groups kvk experts organized 525 handson training programs for 16000 farmers tractor owners and machine operators on management of crop residue kvks organized 24000 demonstrations on operating happy seeder machine and sowing wheat in standing stubbles more than 400 field days and harvest days 375 exposure visits to residueburning free sites 120 kisan melas covering a total of 6 lakh farmers were organized impact of iec against residue burning is seen in the drastic reduction of burning fire events by 52 in 2021 as compared to 2016 poultry farming unit developed by farmersachievements in agricultural extension in independent india 3517 impact of frontline extension investments in agricultural research and extension is low compared to other countries the spending on extension is not commensurate with spending on research over time there has been a gradual increase in the share of investment in agricultural research in the total gdp from 030 in 19901991 to 077 in 20102011 while the increase in the share of investment in agricultural extension in the total gdp has been modest with 012 in 19801981 to 018 in 19901991 this share remains more or less in this range for the subsequent years joshi et al 2015 the return to investment in research and extension are almost equal but huge gap exists in investment in research and extension rate of return to agricultural rd expenditure is quite high and investment reduces income inequality marginal rate of return to agricultural rd expenditure in lowincome states are as high as 99 compared to middle 44 and lowincome states 32 third party evaluation of krishi vigyan kendras kvks has been carried out by national institute of labour economics research and development nilerd an autonomous institute under niti aayog 2015 the major observations and findings of this evaluation are as follows it was observed that kvks are playing proactive role in transferring new technology at field level with beneficial impacts the kvks have an edge in technology transfer over other service providers by virtue of having better technical expertise and demonstration abilities about 40 percent farmers reported that they implemented the technology immediately after its dissemination by kvk and that 25 percent did so from the next agricultural season on an average a kvk covers 43 villages and 4300 farmers per year 80 of villages covered are 10 km away from kvk 96 farmers requests were attended by kvks 42 technologies adopted by farmers resulted in higher productivity 33 resulted in high harvest income and 20 resulted in drudgery reduction about 25 of persons trained started selfemployment ventures with the intervention by kvks about 80 of the farmers have modified their agricultural patterns which were related to diversification of crops and changes in cropping pattern seed planting technique use of fertilizers and pesticides changes in machinery used and in water use pattern besides international food policy research institute ifpri evaluated the kvks in 2019 the major findings of study on kvk by ifpri are as follows kvks efforts generated an additional net farm income of rs 5752 per hectare indian agriculture after independence 352 cost benefit ratio is 11178 thus the rate of return on expenditure on kvk is very high one farmer trained by a kvk disseminates technologyknowledge to 30 fellow farmers 3 flds can benefit 31 other farmers and 3 training beneficiaries can benefit 27 other farmers fld and training primary beneficiaries have 518 and 213 higher adoption rates for flds secondary and network beneficiaries have 126 and 115 higher adoption rates compared to nonbeneficiaries respectively for training programs network beneficiaries have 161 higher adoption rates compared to nonbeneficiaries major findings of study titled impact evaluation of central sector scheme css of indian council of agricultural research icar agricultural extension segment conducted by indian society of agribusiness professionals new delhi during 2020 are given below for training programs network beneficiaries have 161 higher adoption rates compared to nonbeneficiaries on an average kvk outreach found to be around 90100 villages with its strong ict interventions the outreach to villages increases to even 200 villages per kvk there is increase in the outreach programs by kvks from 201213 to 201920 in number of on farm trials by 51 frontlines demos by 61 farmers trained by 16 and extension personnel trained by 35 over a period of time the kvks have emerged as an instrument of change in the technological adoptions across the production systems and largely impacting the farmers income and profitability kvks have proved to be a major district level innovative institution catering the technological needs of the small and marginal farmers and of the progressive farmers to provide the technological options at the cuttingedge level it has made very positive and visible impacts in the far flung tribal hilly and mountainous areas too the kvks have worked in 112 aspirational districts in convergence mode with other departments kvks have played crucial role in providing extension services to farmers which has contributed in increased pulses production in the country they promoted improved varieties of crops related to stress tolerant drought tolerant and facilitated in identification of indigenous varieties practiced by the farmers they have played an important role in promoting climate smart villages and promoted ecosystembased farm practices like organic farming ifs crop residue management and bioagents kvk has trained farmers and extension functionaries on skill enhancement and provided seed and planting materialsachievements in agricultural extension in independent india 353the system so credibly established needs to be supported in terms of requisite manpower and financial provisions various ministries and development departments are proposing programmatic linkages with the kvk system for mutual advantages these very moves indicate the strong urge to strengthen the kvk system further the ict and social media applications are systematically promoted by the kvk system as in the present and future the role of social media would play an important role this is crucial step towards promoting digital agriculture as well as achieving sustainable development goals sdgs in a systematic manner various internet applications and media packages need to be developed linkages with the common service centres are a welcome step in this direction there have been various initiatives taken up by kvks for capacity building of women which includes nutrisensitive agricultural resources innovations nari project initiated in 201718 by kvks to sensitize farm women and aanganwadi workers to combat malnutrition other than this the women participation to the tune of 2530 is ensured in programmes conducted by kvks the kvks are very much focused on the ifs approach and integrated delivery of the technology transfer therefore the agriculture and allied sector flds and ofts should be strengthened along with the strong backward technological linkages there is an urgent need for looking into the income and business orientation to the activities the state and the central development department have been looking at kvks for scientific interventions there should be adequate focus on developing such linkages without affecting the basic mandate of the kvk system evolved over a period of time the recommendations of this study and of the previous studies synthesized indicate continuation and thereby strengthening the kvk system further 8 future roadmap as icar shall be completing 100 years in 2029 kvk system 50 years in 2024 it is proposed for converting 50 years old kvks into new institution of excellence named level districtlevel institute of scientific agriculture disa 81 skill developmentcapacity building commercial agriculture requires added extension services for which reorientation of existing extension system is required including incorporating banking and financial institutions cooperatives etc as extension platforms ict has taken over as a biggest medium to deliver farm advisory to farmers across the country human interface is required for interpretation dissemination and delivery of ict messages to client farmers for which extension workers need to be adept in handling of ict tools market led extension should be given priority and farmers need to be taught to emarket their produce appropriate skill training of extension functionaries is needed and it is possible only through policy indian agriculture after independence 354interventions it is also suggested that regular positions should be filled by well qualified agricultural science graduates available across the country 82 creation of a national level farmers database the kvks and other extension agencies send farm advisory through mobile messages and even through web portals most of such messages are sent in bulk to the farmers and are not farm specific and need based in order to send farm specific messages extension workers should have access to the details of each farmer the creation of a national farmer database of resource endowments crops grown and operations areas under cropping may immensely help in agricultural research and extension and providing farmer specific farm advisories although part of such data base is already available in pm kisan pmfby and agriculture credit and soil health card scheme these are aadhar seeded data all these can be integrated to create the national level database 83 strengthening technology backstop ping backstopping institutions technology backstopping can be strengthened by establishing a fourway mode of communication between labs from land to lab and lab to land and between farms every village can be facilitated by an agriclinic and abribusiness centre acabc to offer the farmers doorstep service and also generate employment in the rural areas the technical backstopping of the farm teleadvisors needs strengthening and number of kcc can be increased there is a growing market for agricultural journalists and broadcasterstelecasters having formal education in agricultural journalism and agricultural communication academic disciplines continuous capacity building of agricultural extension professionals in agricultural journalism deserves priority attention common service centres numbering 347 lakhs may be utilized to also serve as extension delivery points kvks need to be strengthened to focus on income enhancing technologies in ppp mode value addition postharvest agribusiness enterprises 84 agripreneurship and business incubation through skill development of rural youth the icar schemes like arya and student ready rural entrepreneurship awareness development yojana and govt of india schemes like skill india startup india standup india pradhan mantri kaushal vikas yojana are also playing significant role in capacity building of farming community especially the rural youth if business motive can be effectively induced into this component then successful agripreneurs can be developed in rural areas effective hand holding support and incubation should be provided to agristartups which will attract youth towards agriculture and reduce their migration to urban areas 85 promotion of cooperatives and commodity clusters similar to amul and mother dairy models may be promoted in other agricultural products achievements in agricultural extension in independent india 355to take advantage of aggregation of resources kvks may help in capacity development of such groups in project management fund and financing and agribusiness and aggregation 86 farmers local and indigenous practices flip local and indigenous techniques along with the farmers innovations need to be validated and replicated in the similar agroclimatic region frontline extension has a great role in upscaling and outscaling of these technologies 87 promotion of indigenous breedsorganic farmingnatural farming the frontline extension to generate scientific evidences of natural farming and organic farming in different agroclimatic regions so that these technologies may help large scale awareness creation for viable and sustainable farm livelihoods improvements of desi breeds will be beneficial for farmers practicing natural farming building strong farmers institutions and farmer producer organizations will be beneficial for knowledge dissemination credit risk management and for marketing of produce of natural farming 88 farmerled extension and group approach the indian extension system has been suffering from lack of adequate manpower that impacts its reach out to the farmers the alternative is farmer to farmer extension group approach helps in faster and more effective dissemination of information the farmers interest groups figs cooperatives farmer producers companies shgs and various ngos are now playing commendable roles in better farmers participation in implementation of several extension activities these groups are also mobilizing documentation and recognition of farmerled innovations and for further upscaling the recognitions to farmers innovations in the form of awards in various krishi melas and other institutional arrangements have been made across the country 89 ict and social media application for enhanced outreach social media whatsapp face book twitter instagram emails blogs appbased services etc are powerful communication tools that enhance the beneficiary coverage in the shortest period of time which could be used effectively in networking farmers and offering contextspecific information farmportals provide information on ecommerce productionprotection technologies inputsprices e advisories etc 9 conclusion one of the critical masses of the agricultural development is vibrant agricultural extension particularly the frontline extension this has been recognized by virtues of its contribution in many of the revolutions the agriculture experienced in the past 75 years as we move along the knowledge and skillbased agriculture shall be the new life mantra in the next decades and so the public and private research and extension system need to rise to these indian agriculture after independence 356expectations of the millions of farmers in the country and the region who are looking for more precise efficient and productive technologies with a shorter gestation period matching to the local situations and the consumer preference the relevance of agricultural extension system shall depend how quickly we can adapt to changing ecosystem of technology driven farming with much faster but dynamic manmachine interface a robust and efficient extension system which is capable of meeting the evolving needs of farmers in the context of changing agricultural scenario is the need of the hour investment in extension system to create state of the art facilities for the analysis of farmers feedback and realtime response to their queries would serve to establish our credibility and growth in india the scope of agricultural extension has expanded wellbeyond its traditional role in pushing the frontiers of production and productivity in pursuit of the nations food security it is time to strengthen the structural framework

agricultural rd during the last 75 years shaped the countrys path for agricultural development and provided solutions to needs of the people and the planet the initial collaborations with ford foundations and rockefeller foundations in the 1950s and 1960s helped introducing the dwarf varieties of wheat from mexico and establishment of saus on the land grant pattern of usa on education the indous agreement on educational exchange was signed on february 2 1950 in new delhi by prime minister of india and us ambassador that led to establishment of us educational foundation in india and the fulbright program in india the national collaborations with saus which started with aicrp on maize in 1957 unfolded the icarsaus partnership in subsequent decades to become one of the largest collaborative frameworks in agricultural research education and extension globally the international collaboration with mexicocimmyt for exchange of dwarf wheat varietieslines and icarirri for dwarf rice varieties augmented the efforts under green revolution and made india food secure icarirri and icarcimmyt collaborations in rice and wheat later extended for development of varieties for water stressed conditions and rust resistance respectively in india the icaricrisat collaborations starting with research on hybrid pigeonpea and later genomics and gene editing in pulses was also strategic the icarcgiar collaborations expanded to strategic locations through the establishment of icardas food legumes research platform flrp in madhya pradesh and its satellite hubs in west bengal and rajasthan cimmyts borlaug institute for south asia bisa in 2014 at ludhiana along with its field offices in mp and bihar and irrisouth asia regional centre at varanasi in 2017 the collaborative research under network project nicra for climate change and soils water and plant nutrients ifs and agroforestry were strengthened over time international and national collaborations in livestock and fisheries sector helped introduction of new breeds and development of vaccines and diagnostics quality standards health nutrition and hygiene standards and protocols the collaborations in the farm machinery and power helped development of energy efficient farm implements the bilateral cooperation in agricultural rd extended to all continents touching to 65 nations in 202021 india as a founder member of saarc brics bimstec shaped regional cooperation in agricultural rd with member nations the agreements between the governments of india and 359international and national collaborations israel led to establishment of hightech farm demonstration unit at iari in 1996 and later the centre of excellence coe for horticulture in the states under midh the hitech centre and coes served as demonstration and training center for latest technologies for protected cultivation more recently in 2021 bricsarp for collaborations and exchange of information and ideas for research and innovations amongst brics countries was established and made operational in india icar also established collaborates with un agencies like fao undp uncapsa and many organizations such as cabi naca apaari apcaem ista and ishs these collaborations resulted 54 foreign aided projects on ground in 201920 india made an impressive foot print in its neighborhood through the establishment of anastu in afghanistan acare in myanmar and deemed university for agricultural education in nepal besides several initiatives and fellowships implemented in africa the icarindustry collaborations that started in 1990s have been extended for technology dissemination upscaling and validation the international collaboration and its implementation sharpened after 2014 with creation of international relations ir division in icar 1 introduction in a manmachineanimalplantcompeting world the sustainable development of agriculture allied sectors took the central stage in all planned efforts for the progress in an agrarian economy like india the agriculture and allied activities otherwise also was the major source for economic growth at the time of independence as evidenced by their lions share in the nations gdp amongst the various subsectors of agriculture cropping enjoyed the centrality immediately after the independence for ensuring the food security gradually agriculture diversified towards allied activities for raw materials like textiles dairying logging fishing etc agriculture in its entirety have been pivotal for ensuring food security to all on a given geography and income for those who opt it as a primary occupation as the population grew and income increased the dietary intake and demand diversified and consumption also increased which has to be met through the finite land and water resources the luxury of abundance of these resources started drying up and stresses to plant animal and mankind started escalating due to their over exploitation the agriculture research through wellorchestrated national and international collaborations helped the countrys efforts to address the food security concerns raising the income of the farmers and livelihood support to those who depend on the farms and farm related activities preindependence india experienced severe famines and stresses that continued after independence also immediately after independence the agreements between india and ford foundation and rockefeller foundation during 19511959 paved the way for many significant beginnings in indian agriculture in subsequent decades table 1 these included community development programme cdp establishment of state agricultural universities saus and introduction of semidwarf mexican wheat varieties the hurtful memories of pl 480 after two successive severe droughts during 196466 still daunts many due to much undignified remarks of ship to mouth to the country the international collaborations and indian agriculture after independence 360cooperation caused a turned around the entire scenario and helped achieving the successes in indian agriculture the beginning of the international collaborations and joint research was strengthened through the mous with foreign countries international organizations and foreign universities and institutes the process of research collaborations was hastened post 1973 with the establishment of department of agricultural research education dare as a separate department under the ministry of agriculture in the government of india the dare was designated as the nodal department for all the international collaborations for research the collaborations with national agencies and organizations including industries were also sharpened between icar and the institutions universities and organizations working in the field of agriculture and allied sector table 1 milestones in international and national collaborations in agricultural research and development year milestone 1950 establishment of us

douglas ensminger of the ford foundation wrote a briefing paper to pm after his 3 months extensive travel of rural india aicrp on maize started in 1957 opening of the icarsaus partnership 1959 norman borlaug visited india semi dwarf varieties of wheat came into the focus of researchers in india later a mexican wheat variety imported to india 1964 seed of two mexican varieties 20 tons each for demonstration at 1000 acres was requested from dr ne borlaug 1965 demand for 200 tons of seed of sonora 64 and 50 tons of lerma rajo 64a placed to mexico for demonstration at 5000 farmers fields

centre established in varanasi uttar pradesh 2021 bricsarp launched for cooperation in research innovations amongst brics countries 2 agrird preindependence and collaborations the institutional mechanisms of agricultural development in india started as early as 1869 when lord mayo governor general in india proposed the department of agriculture in the government of india with its counterparts in the provinces twenty years later in 1889 the imperial bacteriological laboratory was established in pune which was later shifted to mukteshwar in 1895 and subsequently development of its campus at izatnagar bareilly in 1913 however the first organized and geographically balanced initiative was introduced by lord curzon in 1905 and the imperial agricultural research institute was established at pusa bihar followed by 6 agricultural colleges in the different provinces besides central institutions in 1929 on the recommendations of royal commission on agriculture imperial council of agricultural research icar was set up under the registration of societies act 1860 few commodity committees were also existing at the time of establishment of the imperial council of agricultural research these committees used to provide advisory services to the government and on a limited scale taken up research on cotton lac jute sugarcane coconut tobacco oilseeds arecanut spices and cashewnut etc majority of these activities were standalone and limited to a delineated geography with least domestic collaboration and almost absent international linkages 3 agrird postindependence and collaborations in 1951 the ford foundation a us based ngo signed an agreement with government of india for providing a support of us 12 million for the capacity development of indian personnel in community development programme perkins 1990 in the similar vein the rockefeller foundation also committed to fund agricultural work in india and sent a team to study the agricultural and community situation in india perkins 1997 in 1952 rockefeller foundation launched its collaborative india agricultural programme iap and the technical cooperation administration of us a precursor of usda assured for 50 million to support the community development programme cdp and rural infrastructure programmes in order to study the indian universities and reorganize them on land grant indian agriculture after independence 362pattern of usa an indoamerican team was constituted in 195556 in the same year rockefeller foundation granted us 138 million to develop the iari and initiate the cereals improvement programme gary 2002 following the usdas publication india s food crisis and steps to meet it norman borlaug visited india in 1959 which was the beginning of new research for semidwarf wheat varieties in india during 1964 to 1967 the concerted efforts of the policy planners and researchers in india helped augmenting the mexican wheat varieties touching to its acreage to over 5 lakh ha in 196667 perkins 1990 the research on cotton oilseeds and millets were intensified with the implementation of the project for intensification of regional research on cotton oilseeds and millets pirrcom between 1954 to 1957 the first ever orchestrated institutional linkage and partnership between icar and saus that unfolded the successes in agriculture in subsequent decades was the establishment of aicrp on maize in 1957 based on the learnings of the aicrp on maize the aicrps on important commodities natural resources inputs farm machineries livestock social activities were started subsequently icarsaus is the largest collaborative framework globally in agricultural research education and extension when population was low single crop in a year with traditional varieties and practices was the rule rather than exception the farmers used to grow traditional varieties of all crops postworld war ii the use of synthetic fertilizers became popular for increasing the productivity of foodgrains india started looking for a plant type which should respond to heavy fertilizer usage in 60s the rice varietal development got a shot in the arm with the help of international rice research institute which helped in evolving dwarf high yielding varieties by using the gene from semidwarf chinese varieties the aicrp on rice launched in 1965 coordinated the interdisciplinary and interinstitutional research on rice domestically that helped improving the productivity production and profitability of the farmers the development of taichung nativei from the semidwarf mutant followed by the padma and jaya varieties were the initial but a major breakthrough subsequently several semidwarf varieties of high yield potential were released similar efforts were also made in wheat in 1963 norman ernest borlaugs new semidwarf diseaseresistant varieties revolutionized the spring wheat in mexico dr c subramaniam the then union minister for agriculture and dr ms swaminathan former director general icar along with team of scientists after assessing the possibility of increasing the production of wheat through the use of mexican wheat varieties introduced 5 dwarf varieties lerma rojo 64a sonora 63 sonora 64 mayo 64 and s 227 along with about 200 other breeding lines in 1963 these varieties were stiffer and shorter and relatively photoinsensitive and capable of high yields at high doses of fertilizers irrigation and other inputs subsequently the collaboration with international maize and wheat improvement centre cimmyt mexico was established in 1973 signing the mou between icar and cimmyt the success in other field and horticultural commodities also happened due to domestic and international collaborations particularly the saus and the consultative group of international agricultural research cgiar institutions respectively 363international and national collaborations the field crops varieties much responsive to fertilizers and irrigations were vital revolutions in plant types but resulted into new challenges in soil and water management the multiple cropping became the order of the day post green revolution which intensified the man and machine activities on land causing the soil and water issues along with the concerns of water stressed cropping in rain dependent agriculture this led to the establishment of aicrp on dryland agriculture aicrpda in 1987 with strengthened collaborations with saus which provided scientific solutions for moisture conservation crop production selections of varieties crops and cropping systems crop substitution alternate land use etc for almost all geographies in india more value was added in these efforts with the establishment of aicrp on agrometeorology in the subsequent years the research on longterm fertilizer experimentation soil test crop response micronutrients salt affected soils rainwater management integrated nutrient management integrated farming systems climate variability and agroforestry etc also touched new high with domestic and international collaborations during the last 75 years the parallel efforts also continued for international and national collaborations in the livestock and fisheries sector which helped in developing new breeds quality standards strains and fingerlings vaccines and diagnostics etc the collaborations in research on farm implements and machinery proved promising in enhancing the use efficiency and reducing the cost of cultivations besides reducing the drudgery in farm operations the frontline extension system in india started with the first kvk established in puducherry in 1974 at present each district in india has one kvk many big districts are having 2 kvks today the national agricultural research system is a twotier system comprising of icar at national level and state agricultural universities saus at state level in 2014 icar established international relations ir division to facilitate the initiatives of international cooperation and smoothen the functionalities between dare and icar the international relations division was mandated to have the global technology foresighting enable the research collaboration to reach beyond borders and funding and facilitate smdinstitute interface with dare india suffered the most devastating two consecutive drought during 1964 and 1965 and resorted to import wheat from usa under pl 480 on at relatively low prices and on rupee payment however the transaction with us landed into trouble due to india not supporting american bombings at hanoi and haiphong under vietnam war the icar entered into collaborations in research on rice and wheat that sowed the seed of food security in the country during 19511971 when the country was likely to reap the benefits of technological advancement due to these research collaborations more than 1855 crore people added to our population making it 15 times moafw 2019 resounding confidence came from the fact that the growth in wheat availability outpaced the growth in population and that could happen due to concerted efforts of collaborative research of india with international organizations and domestic organizations and institutions fig 1indian agriculture after independence 364 fig 1 growth rate in population and food grain availability 31 intensification and spread of international collaborations the international cooperation in agriculture research and development has different dimensions and level of engagements under the bilateral

into a moa with the ford foundation on behalf of cgiar in 1973 and subsequently the international crop research institute for semiarid tropics icrisat was established at hyderabad in india table 2 the collaborations with cimmyt and irri was established in 1974 that gave a new boost to our research development of wheat and rice in initial years of green revolution and to maize and ricebased systems in subsequent years the work on potato improvement and protection was strengthened with the collaboration of cip established in 1975 gradually our collaborations expanded covering almost all the fields like crops horticulture animal sciences fisheries biodiversity water agroforestry and policy today icar has active mous with 12 out of 15 cgiar institutes that have helped bolstering our efforts for rd on agriculture and food table 2 along with icrisat government of india also enabled setting up of 11 regional offices and country offices out of 14 cgiar research centers our contribution to cgiar have been acknowledged as donor member of cgiar system for decades india is one amongst the many donor countries having voting rights in the cgiar system council this is because our sizeable contribution through windowi and window iii of the cgiar system the research collaboration involves enhanced cooperation in germplasm exchange and variety technology development to

income of the farmers and livelihood of farm workers and those earning wages in agrirelated activities international collaborations started immediately after independence and broadened their scope and space over time that helped through the revolutions and transformations as the luxury of plentifulness of natural resources is drying up and the problem of plenty of output is escalating collaborations with international organizations through a foresighting mechanism shall be the core activity to innovate in the science based agricultural research in the future the institutional mechanism started in 1973 with the establishment of dare has also sharpened with the establishment of international relations ir division in icar in 2014 and similar setup in the department of agriculture farmers welfare to facilitate the initiatives of international cooperation and smoothen the functionalities between dare and icar the escalating biotic stresses of transboundary nature require much concerted efforts on agri rd for sustainable and resilient agrifood systems the future of agricultural rd collaboration should aim building relationships with centers of excellence in public and private sector in india and overseas focusing on innovations in digital agriculture precision farming climate change management secondary agriculture etc the mechanisms for publicprivate partnerships and csr funding should targeted for augmenting the financing for the implementation of the mutually beneficially projects the global technology foresignting should be strengthened to

during the development process is portrayed it summarizes the importance of technology commercialization the role of intellectual property rights the need for publicprivate partnerships the role of institutional arrangements such as agristartups and fpos and necessary support through higher research allocations for agriculture growth and sustainability 1 introduction agriculture bears the prime responsibility of ensuring food and nutritional security in india the share of agriculture in national output has declined from 53 in 195051 to 18 in 201920 it still provides livelihood to about half of the workforce literature suggests growth in agriculture has strong povertyreducing impacts in india ravallion and datt 1996 thirtle et al 2003 but the farmers earn relatively less income than the nonfarm workers chand et al 2017 improving the income of the agricultural households therefore becomes a critical factor for reducing poverty and inequality in the country agriculture itself has transformed significantly after the independence and has transformed india as well from a fooddeficit economy to a food surplus and netexporting country early developments were initiated in indian agriculture through the scienceled onset of the green revolution during the 1960s which was adequately supported by favorable public policies table 1 after achieving selfsufficiency in food grains the sector is now on the path of commercialization the recent development agenda has shifted from production enhancing strategies to income improvement strategies for farmers welfare this paper 381investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem analyzes the growth trajectory of indian agriculture and dissects the transition from subsistence farming towards the commercialized enterprise in this milieu the role and contributions of investment and policy change in agricultural development have been discussed the paper is divided into three sections the first section discusses trends and patterns in agricultural growth public investment diversification and commercialization section two presents the price policies market reforms institutional development and governance supports for agriculture the third section discusses the role of property rights and partnerships in agricultural development in the country new era of agricultural transformation led by promotion of fpos and

infrastructure and community farming assets 2 agricultural growth and public investment 21 growthtrajectory of agriculture and nonagriculture sectors in india the performance of agriculture depends on a variety of technological institutional and policy interventions the effects of such changes are aptly captured by the growth in gross value added gv a the growth trajectory is examined here by estimating the decadal trendgrowth rate in gv a the trend growth rates are estimated for the 10 years starting from the decade 195152 to 196061 and extended to the latest decade covering the period 201011 to 201920 further the growth in agriculture has been compared with the non agriculture sector to gauge the relative performance the estimated growth rates for the decadal periods ending with 196061 to 201920 are presented in fig 1 383investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem fig 1 trend in decennial growth rate of agriculture and nonagriculture sectors in india source estimates based on mospi data 2020 between 195051 and 201920 the gv a at 201112 prices from agriculture and allied sectors has increased 67 times at an average annual growth rate of 27 the growth however has not been uniform throughout the period the decadal growth rate was 28 in agriculture during 195051 to 196061 which decelerated to 11 till the year 196768 following the expansion of green revolution technologies across the states agricultural growth accelerated significantly and reached about 3 by the year 197576 after a few years of deceleration the growth sustained at above 2 during the 1980s and early 1990s the growth however could not be sustained longer and witnessed a decade of deceleration during the mid1990s to mid2000s this deceleration has coincided with the introduction of globalization and liberalization policies the country adopted in the early 1990s the general neglect of agriculture has been put forth for this deceleration which coincided with limited benefits from the terms of trade the revival began in the mid2000s since when both the terms of trade and agricultural expenditures began to improve the pace of acceleration has been much faster than that was observed during the 1980s agricultural productivity has risen faster notably among the lowproductivity states since the mid2000s growth has turned more inclusive in agriculture since then establishing convergence in agricultural productivity balaji and pal 2014 it is to be noted that growth in the agriculture sector lagged far behind the nonagriculture during the entire period consequently the share of agriculture in national output gv a has declined over time there is a trend reversal in recent years with agriculture growing faster further the growth during the past three years is at the historically highest level since the independence on account of concerted efforts towards technological interventions and policy reforms indian agriculture after independence 38422 agricultural growth at the disaggregated level agriculture and allied sectors comprise crops livestock fisheries and aquaculture and forestry and logging subsectors growth has varied significantly across the subsectors table 2 the overall growth was at the historically highest level during the recent decade 201112 to 201920 the subsectors such as crops and livestock grew at the same pace during the first five decades since the year 195051 since 200102 the livestock sector is growing at a significantly higher rate as compared to the crop subsector the growth of the crop subsector is decelerating in recent years fisheries and aquaculture have also registered significant growth in their output these two sectors both livestock and fisheries have helped to sustain higher growth in agriculture over decades

data from mospi 2020 fig 2 changing composition agricultural output in india source estimates based on mospi 2020 data385investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem diversification has been the prime factor behind growth acceleration and convergence a general shift from crops towards livestock and fisheries sectors is obvious across states pal et al 2020 driven by the demand arising from higher growth in industrial and service sectors observed above and subsequent rise in income per capita this has made agriculture more diversified and marketdriven where markets offer higher prices to the farmers the rising diversification is evident from the declining share of crop subsector in agricultural output from 67 in 195051 to 58 in 201920 fig 2 on the other hand the share of livestock and fisheries subsector is rising over time as the crop subsector remains a predominant constituent of agricultural output there exists huge potential for diversification towards other subsectors 23 commercialization of indian agriculture the onset of the green revolution during the 1960s initiated agricultural intensification using modern inputs ie high yielding varieties chemical fertilizers pesticides etc subsequently the level of input use has increased considerably and indian farmers are steadily shifting from using home grown farm inputs to offfarm inputs the evidences from both factor and product markets indicate that indian agriculture is gradually transitioning towards commercialization with the rising dependence on the market for input needs and output disposal table 3

terms averaged over crops namely rice wheat maize jowar bajra barley ragi arhar gram urad moong and lentil indian agriculture after independence 386the product side change is indicated through increasing marketed surplus and agricultural exports and a diversification towards nonfood grains crops for instance the farmers disposed of about 78 of the products they raised to the market in the triennium ending te 201718 which was 68 just a decade before the share of exports has also risen from 33 in te 198788 to 78 in te 201718 higher area allocations have supported these responses to the markets to date around twothirds of the total crop sector output is contributed by nonfood crops such as cotton for which domestic and trade values are substantial on the factor side rising commercialization is reflected from the increasing use of quality seeds and fertilizer consumption improvement in irrigation coverage and electricity use and reduction in labor use due to rising farm mechanization and other developmental factors pesticide use is also witnessing notable transition despite the presence of regulatory issues subash et al 2017 24 public expenditure in agriculture and rural development a gradual rise in the public sector expenditures in agriculture and rural development have helped for the transition the public expenditure at 201112 prices has increased gradually from 1991 to 2005 but has risen more rapidly afterwards fig 3 it was less than a lakh crore in the early 1990s but stands at around four lakh crores at present rising around 4 times within a short span even in a relative term measured as a share to total expenditures incurred by the public sector the share of agriculture including rural development has begun to rise in recent years as a shift in the earlier trend the growth in expenditure has risen in agriculture from 34 in the 1990s to more than 14 in the 2010s and in irrigation expenditure these shares have been 39 and 115 respectively the expenditures on development like roads and infrastructure have also risen substantially in the rural regions helping for higher agricultural growth and sustainability rs 000 crore at 201 112

entrepreneurial ecosystem 25 impact on food production the immediate impact of scientific developments and investment is reflected through the increase in food production to fulfill rising demand the estimates show that growth in food production at the aggregate level1 in the country has remained higher than the growth in the population consequently the per capita food production in the country has increased from just 094 kgday in 195051 to 265 kgday in 201920 fig 4 notwithstanding during the recent years 200102 to 201920 growth in population has decelerated which has further provided a fillip to the growth in per capita food production in india the present level of food production is sufficient to sustain food security in the country niti aayog 2018 the production growth is primarily led by improvement in productivity chand and srivastava 2018 have decomposed growth in production of crop groups into area effects yield effects and interaction effects of area and yield during 200405 to 201415 and found that 92 76 and 67 of the growth in production of cereals pulses and oilseeds were attributed to increase in yield thus an increase in yield has emerged as a major contributor to food production in the country fig 4 trend in per capita food production in india source data from agricultural statistics at a glance various issues and mospi 2020 3 institutional development and governance 31 credit demands informal finance and the rise of formal financial institutions credit institutions and their supportive policies over years have played a pivotal role in the present state of developments in agriculture credit inadequacy in the farm sector has long been felt even before the introduction of the green revolution in the country and several 1foodgrains edible oil sugar fruits vegetables spices milk eggs meat and fish aggregated using foodgrain equivalent unit prices as weightindian agriculture after independence 388interventions have been made to address the demand the cooperative societies act passed in 1904 and subsequent reforms through the maclagan committee on cooperation in 1915 the examination of rural credit program by the royal commission on agriculture in 1926 27 sir malcolm darlings report on cooperative credit to the government of india in 1935 are the examples even then almost entire credit requirements of the farmers were observed to be financed by the money lenders and the formal agencies like cooperatives had a minor role in the year 1951 the money lenders financed around 70 of the cultivators credit requirements table 4 not more than 33 of the farmers accessed their credit needs through the cooperatives the access to finance through the commercial banks was still worse less than a percent the practice of capital and inputintensive agriculture since the adoption of green revolution technologies in the mid1960s and the technology spillover to the rest of the regions accelerated the need for further finance for agriculture in the year 1974 following the concept of priority sector lending that comprised agriculture the commercial banks were advised to raise the share of these sectors in their aggregate advances to the level of 3333 by march 1979 further efforts were done by attaching each district with a commercial lead bank the regional rural banks rrbs were set up following the recommendations of the narasimham committee in 1976 in the year 1982 the national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard was established the nabard undertook the agricultural creditrelated

increased credit flow in agriculture in the coming years notably the access to finance from the commercial banks rose dramatically from less than a percent in 1951 to more than 35 in 1991 this has enhanced further to 445 in the year 2019 due to both the expansion of commercial banks in the rural regions and the governments supportive policies towards the farm sector the composition of credit has also undergone major changes table 5 the higher access of finance of farmers from the commercial banks was also complemented with an increased rate of credit delivery over the years rather the role of cooperatives in credit delivery has declined since the rrbs came into operation from around 50 in the year 198384 the share of cooperatives in the total agricultural credit outstanding has declined to just above 13 in 201920 on the other side the share of rrbs has risen from 44 to 148 during this period surpassing the credit outstanding of cooperatives when measured in terms of growth while the cooperative sectors credit outstanding grew annually at the rate of 107 it was 18 in the commercial banks and 195 in the rrbs during 19912020 32 subsidies income transfers and public investment public institutions both at the centre and states have cushioned throughout the time the risks the farmers faced in agriculture and their efforts to minimize the costs of inputs used in agriculture for higher profit realizations subsidies and waivers have been the prime instruments the centre incurred the subsidy expenses amounting to more than rs 81 thousand crores comprising urea and nutrientbased subsidies in the year 201920 to offer fertilizers at affordable prices table 6 the expense was just rs 60 crores in 1976 77 it rose to about rs 44 thousand crores in 199091 to rs 138 thousand crores in 200001 and to 623 thousand crores in 201011 similarly to facilitate higher credit flow institutional finance is being offered for years at lower interest rates the government introduced a subvention rate of 2 in kharif 200607 to the commercial cooperative and regional rural banks for the shortterm production credit it introduced an additional 1 in 200910 which was hiked to 2 in 201011 and 3 in 201112 the subvention was extended from crop growing farmers to animal and fish growers since 201819 costs of such inventions have generally been higher in the year 201920 the government incurred a credit subsidy of more than rs 16 thousand crores at this end table 6 selected financial expenditures of the government rs crores 201920 year fertilizer subsidydirect income

other institutional intervention to support farmers to meet out their farm expenses has been the approach of direct income transfer on 24th february 2019 the union government launched the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi pmkisan scheme an amount of rs 6000 is transferred in three installments in a year directly into the farmers bank accounts since then the present statistics show more than 11 crore farmers are benefitting through this scheme which translates into an expense of rs 66 thousand crores to the government to note the rise in subsidy burden over years has not been at the cost of a decline in public sector capital in agriculture the public sector gross capital formation gcf in agriculture which reflects the investment made in agriculture was about rs 357 thousand crores in the year 201112 this rose to rs 562 thousand crores in 201516 and to rs 761 thousand crores in 201920 thus the centre has extended huge financial support to the welfare of the farmers among the states loan waivers had been the major welfare intervention other than offering electricity at subsidized rates for agricultural purposes the burden of such waivers on the states exchequer had generally been high sometimes the aggregate of waivers in a few states has surpassed the centres expenditures on fertilizer subsidies for the entire nation ie in the year 201718 one shall note that other than these seasonalirregular waivers in states the centre spends regularly on credit subsidies as noted earlier estimates show that they have risen from around rs 2000 crores in 200910 to around rs 6000 crores in 201314 and to more than rs 12000 crores in 201516 with the expanding credit requirements over years and with the governments financial inclusion initiatives the credit subsidies shall rise further in the coming years 33 price policies market reforms governance and innovations the governance support has evolved parallelly with the developments in agriculture the acceleration in productivity with the onset of green revolution has brought a transformation in indian agriculture institutions namely the commission for agricultural costs prices cacp and the food corporation of india fci were established in 1965 to assist the farmers with price support operations on one side and ensure the productivity gains reaching the consuming sector through the public distribution system pds on the other side the former institution was mandated to recommend the government the minimum support prices msp at which the latter institution was obliged to procure food commodities to distribute to the public the support price act as a safety net to the farmers notably when the market fails to guarantee reasonable prices to the commodities at present the msp is announced for 14 kharif crops and 10 rabi crops further the fair and remunerative price frp is announced for sugarcane to guarantee the price to the sugar growers and for the smooth operation of sugar industries unlike msp the frp is paid by the sugar industries these procurement mechanisms ensure the nations capability to maintain adequate buffer stock for national food security and act as a tool for domestic price stability in recent years concerted efforts have been made for farmers welfare by scalingup public procurements in the kharif marketing season 391investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem kms 202021 about 60 million tons mt of rice was procured from the farmers which was just 32 mt in kms 201415 similarly more than 39 mt of wheat was procured in the rabi marketing season rms 202021 and it was around 28 mt in rms 201415 the procurement of these two commodities itself has benefitted more than 13 crore farmers and more than 43 lakh farmers in the kharif and rabi marketing seasons respectively in 202021 the recent agricultural ecosystem has encouraged innovations in agricultural practices in the policy domain the idea of higher production and productivity has reshaped into higher income and price realizations at the market the government aims to double the farmers income double the agricultural exports connect the traditional agricultural marketing system electronically through the approaches like enational agricultural market enam handhold the farmers to copeup with rising prices and climatic risks through a series of insurance programs that are improved upon over time encourage soil conservation and organic farming practices among the farmers are a few examples more appreciable was the introduction of farm laws ie a the farmers produce trade and commerce promotion and facilitation act 2020 b farmers empowerment and protection agreement of price assurance and farm services act 2020 and c amendments in the essential commodities amendment act the first two acts provided a mechanism to the farmers to carry out their farm businesses outside the apmcs and allow them to enter into contracts thus encouraging freemarket operations the last act allowed trade in food grains pulses edible oils and onion except in times of crisis which were not permitted earlier these reforms were aimed to promote competitiveness among farmers thus promoting domestic and international trade while the recent repeal of these laws sets the agendas back towards maintaining protectionist forms one shall hope for alternate mechanisms that promote the intensions of free trade no wonder the concept of governance is gradually transforming into egovernance other than connecting agricultural markets electronically one shall cite the efforts taken to connect the farmers in the financial inclusion process as a major move since its inception 1998 around 19 crore kisan credit cards have been issued so far till 201920 attracting farmers to the formal financial institutions the introduction of the direct benefit transfer approach in the fertilizer industry direct income transfers to the farmers through pmkisan and digitalization of rural land records are the other major initiatives at this front the gradual emergence of the private sector in the agroadvisory services in recent years marks an improvement in information governance for the welfare of the farmers the entry of amazon retail in india to offer agronomy services the collaboration of the indian council of agricultural research icar with the digital india corporation dic for extending teleadvisory services the joint efforts of microsoft and the international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat for sowing advisories and the partnership of the ministry of

relative terms india lags behind several countries it currently ranks 14 th in the total global patent filing in the agriculture and allied sector the monetary value out of the patent system is paid limited attention and patents are used as a protection mechanism rather preservation of innovations and preventing competitors from claiming priority over the invention has become the key focus 41 commercialization of technology for a responsive agricultural research system committed support of the government is a necessary factor pal 2017 technologies produced by the public rd institutions are commercialized to various private and public companies the indian council of agricultural research icar commercializes its technologies through the institutional mechanism developed under the ip and technology commercialization policy in 2006 since 1991 the icar has commercialized several technologies these technologies are disseminated through the state department of agriculture state agricultural universities 393investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem national seed corporation and other public entities after the year 2007 the number of technologies commercialized has

development of entrepreneurial ecosystem agristartups and farmer producer organizations innovation in the technology development process for helping the agrifood system in addressing grand challenges is critical to fulfil the challenges pertaining to sustainable development goals sdgs until midnineties the role of public funded research institutions in innovation management in india were significantly higher later with opening of the economy private sector led innovation played a major role in growth of economy the rise of new generation entrepreneurs or startups since last decade led by innovative ideas to solve the problems along with ethical business practices are playing in profound ways these startups have emerged in almost every sphere of life agriculture healthcare biotech engineering fintech transport environmental services clean energy logistic it services marketplace etc the cumulative effect has pushed the rank of india in global innovation index 2021 to 46 th position india ranked 2nd among the 34 lower middleincome group economies the term startup denotes the early stage of an enterprise with sciencebased innovations having potential to scale up as per the government of india gazette notification 2019 an entity incorporated or registered in india not prior to 10 years with an annual turnover not exceeding rs 100 crores in any preceding financial year working towards innovation development or improvement of new products or processes or services or it is a scalable indian agriculture after independence 394business model with a high potential of employment generation or wealth creation shall be considered as a startup agriculture and allied sector have been witnessing emergence of several startups commonly termed as agristartups these agristartups develop products services to bring efficiency in the value chain at different stages like infrastructure storage warehousing farm automation digital farming advisory services precision agriculture upstream startups input delivery and advisory downstream startups market linkages for output fintech agrifinance and insurance agribiotech new inputs postharvest methods etc many of these startups are using new generation it tools like artificial intelligence ai internet of things iot imaging sensors remote sensing drone data analytics blockchain technology etc in agriculture and allied sector for improving yield efficiency and profitability on the other hand the primary agricultural cooperative society pacs is one of the oldest forms of farmers organizations in india additionally there have been many other forms of producer organizations catering to specific or multiple functions such as selfhelp groups shgs federation of shgs common interest groups cigs joint liability groups jlgs and farmers clubs in common parlance all these may be termed as farmers producers organizations fpos moreover cooperatives in agriculture sector could not make profound impact in improving the livelihood and income of the farmers across the country as it has done in some sectors like dairy sugar or fertilizer production growing agrarian crisis over the years and simultaneously healthy growth of private sectors led to beginning of new thinking of bringing best attributes of both the sectors the cooperatives and the corporates together in the year 2000 the concept of producer companies was recommended by a committee chaired by prof y k alagh in 2002 the companies act of 1956 was amended and new section part ixa was inserted for producer companies a new form of corporate entity goi 2002 these companies were designed on mutual assistance principles and patronage basis to bring together desirable aspects of the cooperative and corporate sectors for the benefit of primary producers especially small and marginal farmers alagh 2019 goi 2000 though the act was extended beyond agriculture and farming and nonfarming sectors like rural artisans were also included in its ambit in order to promote the mobilization of farmers and form the fpos under new framework as a producer company small farmers agribusiness consortium sfac under ministry of agriculture government of india was designated as nodal agency such fpo is specifically called as farmers producers company fpc currently fpos are registered as different legal entities most of the fpos are registered under companies act or state cooperative society act while some are also registered as mutually aided cooperative society macs or trust or section 8 company although several supporting government schemes for fpos are valid only for those fpos which are registered either under companies act or under cooperative society act395investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem 51 ecosystems for agristartups agristartups are new business entities which need support for its growth and sustainability the appropriate ecosystem needed in the economy comprises of enabling policies easy funding support at early stage incubation facilities and mentors startups usually fail due to lack of technical support to validate innovation financial support at early stage scaleup and low market acceptability of products and services startup india action plan was launched in january 2016 by the government of india which paved the way for the introduction of a number of policy initiatives aiming at building a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and startups goi 2016 this has led to a tremendous surge in incorporation of new companies with innovative ideas in almost every sector including agriculture the technologyled startups alias techstartups are also growing in big number the incubators and accelerators play a major role in nurturing these entrepreneurs startups the incubators are mostly technology backed where the innovations are validated and improved if needed bring the technology to market acceptability stage besides these incubators also provide business technical financial legal ipr and networking services to the startupsentrepreneurs to sustain and grow their business these help in mustering support services for startups finding funding agencies such as angel investors venture capitalists and better networking opportunities for locating good markets this support system is also relevant to the agristartups presently there are about 890 incubators in india out of these about 80 incubators are agriculture specific while about 300 incubators are working in multiple sectors including agriculture there are 50 incubators across different icar institutes which facilitate the business environment to the agrientrepreneurs besides there are 29 incubators supported by ministry of agriculture farmers welfare in icar institutions iims and state agricultural universities saus nabard has also created 5 agribusiness incubators these incubators work in different domain knowledge like animal science crop science agricultural engineering agricultural education horticulture fisheries and natural resource management the nidhi 2 incubation programme of department of science and technology supports startups by its more than 150 technology business incubators tbis through seed support system sss and accelerator programmes with these tbis similarly department of biotechnology through its company biotechnology industry research assistance council birac has promoted incubators called bionest through different supporting programmes like birac ignition grant big small business innovation research initiative sbiri etc niti aayog is also supporting incubation centers under atal innovation mission 2 department of science and technology dst under government of india through its national science and technology entrepreneurs development board nstedb initiated technology business incubator tbi programme in the year 2000 to incubate and handhold startups in india the programme was later rechristened as national initiative for developing and harnessing innovations nidhi incubation programme in 2016indian agriculture after independence 396these programmes are sector agnostic these incubator centres are established at public as well as private academic and research institutions in agriculture sector icar initiated entrepreneurship development programme in 2012 by establishing 10 business planning and development bpd units 5 in icar institutes and 5 in state agricultural universities this was followed by 12 more such units in 2013 the primary objective of these bpds was to focus on transfer of technology to commercial ventures so that the developed technology reaches targeted stakeholders later under xii plan the project on national agriculture innovation fund naif addressed issues towards innovation and incubation by supporting agribusiness incubation abi centres this initiative was more focused on startup entrepreneurship presently icar has 50 abis together 977 entrepreneurs and startups were enrolled in these abis during 201421 against only 611 entrepreneurs enrollment in 20082014 success rate was very high in current period due to very conducive policies like startup india mudra loan and other programme were launched these incubates created job opportunities for more than 20000 people to develop the ecosystem culture icar institutes also conduct entrepreneurship development programmes the council also organized a two days agristartup and entrepreneurship conclave for unleashing potential in agriculture for young agripreneures upaya on the world food day during 1617 october 2018 as ecosystem building exercise about 700 participants attended the conclave which includes 104 icar abinetwork nurtured agristartups entrepreneurs licensees from different corners of the country it had provided a unique platform for bringing together agriprofessional business experts researchers and farm producers organizations fpo in a facetoface mode same time countrys finest mentors angel investors and venture capitalists were also interacted in different technical domains later ministry of agriculture farmers welfare government of india also launched rkvy raftar 3 scheme to promote agripreneurship and agribusiness by providing financial support through existing incubator centres in the country the canvas of agribusiness incubation initiatives is wide and diverse with players from icar research institutes saus iits iims other engineering management colleges ngos and other corporate entities 52 role of policy in the startup ecosystem journey of a startup starts from scouting an innovative idea to solve some major problems and then takes the startups to different stages of growth fig 6 describes the stages of growth and the possible funding

for agristartups startups in agrisector have many avenues to raise the initial capital besides bootstrapping and lending from family friends as discussed earlier all the incubators support the agristartups in initial stages incubating with them under different seed support schemes the ciie the incubator of iim ahmedabad started seed funding in startups later many other agristartups raised seed fund from different incubators among icars incubators aidea of naarm has been the pioneer as it invested in 12 agristartups as a seed investment it becomes easier for these agristartups to raise funding from vcs and other investors later if they get early investment from the incubators apart from this there are several individual angel investors who look for scalable ideas to invest in at early stage in expectation of early scale up similarly there are many venture capitals vcs firms like omnivore partners aavishkaar indian agriculture network ian accel ankur capital kalari social alpha accel and beenext which are invest in good startups at early stage in agriculture and allied sector recently some global funds such as blume nexus sequoia indian agriculture after independence 398tiger global and rtp also taking interests in the sector overall indias agritech startups have been growing at 45 yoy the startups have raised more than us 313 million investment as per the nasscom report in 2020 this sector is expected to entice more than us 500 million in the next few years 54 agristartups scenario in india startups come with innovative ideas to fill the gaps in the agri and food value chains farmers in developing countries face multiple risks on several fronts and these startups endeavor to address them using new generation it tools such as internet of things iot big data analytics blockchain technology and so on the three broad categories of startup innovations identified are preproduction startups which are engaged in advisory crop planning soil testing input supplies including financing production stage startups which include advisory in agronomy plant protection inputs irrigation scheduling and execution etc and postproduction stage startups which include quality analysis processing storage warehousing and market linkages in india there are 55390 dpiit recognized startups registered with startup india initiative of government of india out of these there are 2421 and 2405 registered startups in agriculture and food beverage sector respectively most of these startups have come up since 2016 preproduction agristartups the availability and quality of inputs and proper advisory to the farmers is a serious problem affecting productivity and profitability of farmers several agristartups have been offering solutions to optimise the use and enable delivery of assured quality inputs to farmers along with proper advisory agrostar is the largest startup in input supply to farmers and is expected to be unicorn soon it has mobilised us 47

corporation nafed food corporation of india fci were encouraged to include fpos in their activities similarly nabard and other financial institutions were also roped in to facilitate the availability of short and mediumterm credit for the fpos for this equity grant and credit guarantee fund scheme was initiated to provide a grant up to 100 lakhs to double the member equity of the fpos and also seek collateralfree loans up to rs 100 crore from the banks indian agriculture after independence 400in 2013 fpo formation guidelines were issued by government of india and next year 2014 was declared as year of farmer producer organizations fpos by the ministry of agriculture government of india with special package allocation of rs 200 crores to nabard4 as produce fund to promote fpos apart from this the national policy also laid the framework for mobilization of fpos with a dedicated source of funding from the rashtriya krishi vikas yojana rkvy these concerted efforts created huge awareness among the farmers and other stakeholders due to which formation and registration of fpos got significant boost across the country as on 31st mar 2021 there are 9500 fpos registered under companies act which are called as farmers producers companies fpcs these fpos are registered with the ministry of company affairs mca government of india and their names end with producer company limited these fpcs might have been formed with the support of nabard sfac private companies ngos state departments or even private individuals from the figure below it can be observed that more than 98 of these fpcs have been formed after the year 2015 apart from this there are about 1500 fpos registered under state cooperative society actmutually aided cooperative societytrust etc therefore we can say that there are almost 10000 fpos registered as different legal entity existing in the country these fpos are distributed across all the states though with varying density within the category of fpos the fpcs have an advantage over cooperatives in the light of their democratic and producermember based operation and management in a farmer producer company unlike in a private limited company each member has only one vote irrespective of the number of shares held only primary producers can become shareholders of any fpc each fpc is governed by board of directors bods selected out of the shareholdermembers though the bods may also have outside experts as independent directors without having any voting rights the fpc may have hired staffs including managerceo to run the business operations smoothly thus fpos fpcs are member owned and selfmanaged organizations and hence involvement of the farmer members since the beginning is essential the basic principles behind a fpc are voluntary and open membership democratic farmer member control autonomy and cooperation amongst farmers 56 fpos leveraging multipronged benefits to the smallholder farmers overcoming the constraints imposed by the small size of their individual farms fpo members are able to leverage collective strength and bargaining power to access financial and nonfinancial inputs services and appropriate technologies reduce transaction costs tap high value markets and enter into partnerships with private entities on more equitable terms fpos offer the farmers advantages that come from higher scales of operation at various stages of the agricultural value chain system from preproduction stage of quality 4 national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard is an apex financing agency for the institutions providing investment and production credit for promoting the various developmental activities in rural areas it is under the jurisdic tion of ministry of finance government of india the bank has been entrusted with matters concerning policy planning and operations in the field of credit for agriculture and other economic activities in rural areas in india401investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem input purchase to collectivization of outputs value addition storage and transportation marketing in the process the fpos earn from a range of activities and services depending upon the commodities produced by the farmermembers the fpos can earn revenueprofit by bulk buying and selling of seeds fertilizers pesticides and facilitating in custom hiring services of farm implements they also earn income by way of providing primary processing cleaning and grading andor value addition and levying auction fee from buyers for selling the produce 57 government policies promoting fpo ecosystem myriad of constraints faced by the smallholder farmers in india stimulated the government to create enabling environment for the fpos the fpos can enhance rural development poverty reduction productivity gains and food security through their role in facilitating effective and efficient smallholder participation in agricultural value chain major problems for these fpos are to raise funds for the working capital and creating minimum basic infrastructure business acumen among the management team lack of understanding of markets for different produce etc therefore the government in recent years have initiated several schemes to address these issues of the fpos 1 equity grant scheme of sfac under the scheme eligible fpos whose paid up capital is less than rs 30 lakh receive a grant equivalent to their equity contribution of their shareholder members in the fpo subject to a maximum of rs 1000 lakh per fpo in two tranches this helps in enhancing viability and sustainability of the nascent fpos 2 credit guarantee fund scheme of sfac under this scheme sfac provides credit guarantee cover to the eligible lending institutions banks to give collateral free credit to the eligible fpos up to rs 100 lakhs maximum guarantee cover is restricted up to 85 of the amount 3 venture capital assistance of sfac the sf ac provides financial support in the form of a soft loan for the qualifying projects of the eligible fpos the venture capital assistance helps fpos to make investment in setting up agribusiness project the cost of proposed agribusiness project would have to be between rs 15 lakh and rs 500 lakhs the sfac also helps in developing the detailed project report dpr with the help of empaneled consultant 4 financing schemes of nabard nabard through its subsidiary nabkisan finance limited provides credit assistance to the fpos at various stages of their life loan products are customized to meet the requirement of fpos without collateralguarantee cover the items eligible for assistance broadly include capital cost such as cost of building machinery and equipment for processing specially designed vehicles for transportation etc andor working capital requirements for input supply procurement collective marketing and other recurring costs connected with the projectindian agriculture after independence 4025 agriculture infrastructure fund under central sector schemes in the year 2020 the government of india has set up agriculture infrastructure fund aif worth rs 1 lakh crores for creating farmgate infrastructure the fpos can get the medium to longterm debt financing with interest subvention under this fund for investment in viable project relating to postharvest management infrastructure like processing ripening chambers assaying sorting grading facility modern packaging storage warehousing etc the scheme is operational from 202021 to 202930 the credit guarantee coverage is available for the fpos for a loan up to rs 200 lakhs 6 pm matsya sampada yojana under central sector schemes as a part of atmanirbhar bharat package the government of india launched the pm matsya smapada yojana in the year 2020 for next 5 years for supporting fish farmers and fish fpos under this credit guarantee assistance is provided to fish growers for modernizing and strengthening of fish value chain 7 central sector scheme on formation and promotion of 10000 new fpos this is so far the largest focused scheme from government of india to promote new 10000 fpos in india with initial financial and managerial support the scheme is targeted for fiveyear period of 201920 till 202324 with adequate handholding support to the fpos for five years till 202728 it envisages to form and promote at least 15 of the targeted 10000 fpos in aspirational districts with at least one fpo in each block of these districts in the country for this sfac ncdc national cooperative development corporation and nabard have been identified as implementing agencies ias thus the fpos under the scheme can be formed either under companies act or under states cooperative societies act the ias will engage specialized cluster based business organizations cbbos who have prior experience of farmer mobilization marketing of agricultural products mis management information system implementation and overall business development of farmer organizations under this scheme the fpos get funding support for first 3 years besides it can avail equity guarantee of up to rs 150 lakhs and credit guarantee up to rs 20 crore of project loan per fpo through the ias capacity building and skill development of ceosboard of directors accountant and other stakeholders are made through different nationalregional training institutions in india in addition all the development schemes in agricultural and allied sectors currently being implemented by central andor all the state governments in the country encourage the fpos to be the beneficiaries of the programmesschemes it has been observed that the fpos perform better when its management systems governance and capital structure are strong other factors like market and financial accessibility farmermembers engagement plan infrastructure development better than existing market pricing mechanism etc should also be strengthened to scale up the business of the fpos for its longterm growth and viability 403investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem 58 success stories of fpos undoubtedly there are several challenges in the way of fpos in india such as weak sense of ownership among producershareholders inadequate funding support poor management skills weak governance lack of business understanding etc prasad and prateek 2019 govil et al 2020 the collectivization of activities through fpo would spur vertical business integration this would increasingly be serving the twin purpose of profit making and welfare of its shareholders and local communities it could prove an effective antipoverty approach propelling rural entrepreneurship and youth employment in india the fpos are benefitting the smallholder farmers in various ways average family income of fpomemberfarmers has significantly increased fpos provided easy access to farm inputs as well as linkages with the financial institutions in west bengal das and mandal 2021 similarly bhose agro producer company in solapur district of maharashtra with over 500 members has been exporting chillies and earning annual turnover of about rs 150 cr other fpos namely narmadanchal producer company in sehore district of madhya pradesh established in 2013 has increased its annual turnover to rs 2 crores in first 3 years it has undertaken agriinput trading and commodity trading businesses the fpo got funding support from nabkisan similarly narsingh fpcl established in 2006 in madhya pradesh is actively involved in agriinput trading seed production trade of agricultural produce it has set up its own seed processing infrastructure with its about 2000 farmershareholders the turnover of the company has reached to rs 979 crores in fy 201516 thus there are several success stories of fpos in different parts of the country it is noteworthy is illustrate the success story of two fpos which has established complete value chain and works in federation mode i sahyadri farmers producers company ltd sfpc sfpc is one of the most successful fpos in india it was incorporated in december 2010 now it is working as federation of about 12 fpcs in maharashtra state the sfpc has 726 individual shareholders and all the fpcs under it are also the shareholders the company is thus connected with more than 6000 farmers growing different horticultural crops mainly fruits like grapes tomato banana pomegranate guava vegetables floriculture etc the company now operates in businesstobusiness b2b as well as serving directly to customers d2c through its own retail stores in the state in the year 2019 the company became indias largest grape exporter the sfpc provides technology and services to the producer fpcs members improving crop productivity and quality it also helped in optimization of cost of production the value addition and marketing of the produce are taken care by the umbrella company viz sfpc the company has introduced the technology not only for the business operations but also digitized the fields of its memberfarmers to monitor and control the traceability of the produce in the year 2020 the sfpc achieved revenue of rs 465 crores and net profit of rs 19 crores the current paidup capital of the company is rs 5567 crores and authorized capital of rs 70 crores 2020 the sfpc has raised most of the funds as debt from the banks for its operation and expansion the company has created stateoftheart infrastructure facilities for value addition processing cold storage as well as training indian agriculture after independence 404centre near nasik the company is targeting to significantly improve the livelihood of more than 10000 farmers of state in next 5 years ii sahaja aharam farmers producers company ltd safpc safpc is also a federation of 23 organic farmer producer organization in andhra pradesh maharashtra and telangana states which owns endtoend supply chain from seed to final products the safpc headquartered at hyderabad was incorporated under companies act in november 2014 it is working with 10000 fully organic farmers the company has authorized capital of rs 25 lakhs and paidup capital of rs 175 lakhs it received credit funding of rs 80 lakhs from nabkisan finance ltd in two tranches the company procures crop produce from certified organic farmers process at its own foodhubs sells to other businesses or through its own exclusive retail stores as certified products under npopusda standards more than 100 skus stock keeping units of products including cereals millets edible oils sweeteners spices processed foods readytoeat and readytocook health foods fresh fruits vegetables etc are also available on ecommerce platform the safpc provides the technical knowhow seeds and conducts capacity building programmes for the farmermembers on continuous basis by shortening supply chain the safpc ensures about 50 higher price to the producerfarmers 59 synergising the agristartups with fpos for atmanirbhar bharat india cant become atmanirbhar unless the income and livelihood of its food producers are ensured currently the income from farming is abysmally low merely rs 816 per capita per month the farm income can be increased by either reducing cost of crop animal production or by increasing per unit productivity by adopting modern production technologies and improved resources use efficiency or by creating and capturing value from the agricultural value chain it may happen alone or in combination of these factors for these to happen innovators and producers need to come together therefore strong synergy between agristartups and fpos farmer produce organisations are imminent it offers winwin opportunities for both the entities on one side farmermembers get access to modern technologies products and services offered by innovative agristartups at their doorsteps on the other hand agristartups get access to huge market of farmers and their produce for their business activities such collaboration would reduce the transaction costs for both the entities and help the farmers in realising better income from farming the fpos by design carry out aggregation of demand for farm inputs as well as farm produce and link farmers to markets they need support in the form of financing advisory quality inputs farm record maintenance capacity building warehousing primary processing etc the agristartups in india are trying very hard to achieve a sizeable scale the majority of these startups are fundstarved to spend on customer acquisition on their own majority of them are revenue positive yet not profit earning we are already seeing many startups orienting their business models to cater to the needs of fpos fpos get the most innovative technology and services for their farmers at low cost creating value for technology thus handshake between farmers organization and agristartupsentrepreneurs like startup405investment policy and entrepreneurial ecosystem fpo immersion programme of aidea will create unique winwin collaborative business models and fpos have a huge role to play in making this happen 6 conclusion scientific advancements are reshaping indian agriculture rapidly the achievement of cereal selfsufficiency is gradually shifting towards other commodities such as pulses on the production side market and priceresponsive commodities like milk meat fish fruits vegetables and other cash crops are increasingly being grown and income and profits are replacing supply augmenting strategies a pattern of diversified agriculture is clearly visible simultaneously business ecosystem is gradually expanding and supportive mechanisms for agripreneurshipstartups such as technology business incubators and financial infrastructure is concentrating at this front technologies and policies ensuring sustainability need continuous efforts ranging from sustainability in resource use environmental impacts riskhandling information and business ecosystem development upscaling expenses for research and development rd and research prioritization would be the key to meeting them on the other side encouraging and incentivizing private sector participation notably in commercialization of agricultural technologies developing agri preneurship through startups and supporting innovative organizations like fpos would help to balance the agricultural ecosystem in the coming years references

thammi raju tavva srinivas bharat s sontakki and g venkateshwarlu icarnational academy of agricultural research management hyderabad telangana summary national agricultural research education and extension system nares evolved over years with the significant contribution of its visionary leaders today nares is confronted with reducing resources and scientific manpower and localization impacting the national character of the organization and a scenario demanding solutions for complex problems such situation demands for strong and visionary leadership to effect the change both structural and cyclical to make the organization relevant to the emerging challenges and contextual to the geopolitical ecosystem the journey of last 90 years of nares has been full of reforms and innovations the bulk of them happening postindependence the indianization of imperial council of agricultural research in 1929 was the first and foremost important reform that put the very basic foundation of the diversified organization in the form of indian council of agricultural research we have today since 1929 icar was subjected to periodical reviews and emerged stronger after every review due to the vision and stewardship provided by its leaders from time to time following the recommendations of gajendragadkar committee in 1972 dare was created in 1973 to provide linkage with government and line departments the institutional mechanism of interinstitutional linkages was established following the creation of subject matter divisions after the recommendations of gvk rao committee 1988 functional autonomy to the scientists following the johl committees recommendations in 1995 icarindustry interface and scientistentrepreneur tieup after mashelkar committees recommendations in 2005 restructuring of asrb reforms in aicrps cadre review and accreditations of saus were implemented after peer review committee in 2017 the one of its kind reforms of allowing foreign germplasms in the breeding programme changed the face of the indian agriculture postindependence and forever due to visionary politicalscientific leadership in 60s the establishment of agricultural scientists recruitment board asrb in 1973 krishi vigyan kendra kvk in 1974 and agricultural research service ars in 1975 and agrinnovate india ltd agin in 2011 for commercialization of icar technologies were the landmark structural reforms parallelly the leadership in icar helped country to move on the path of revolutions through green white yellow blue and more recently pulses sugar and gene revolution icar actively engaged itself in the policy formulation and implementation such as specifications and standards for biofertilizers and microindian agriculture after independence 408inoculants under fertilizer control order 1985 comprehensive marine fisheries policy 2004 seed bill 2004 coastal aquaculture authority act 2005 nutrientbased subsidy for fertilizers

pesticide management bill 2020 regulations on germplasm and biodiversity quarantine climate change mitigation and adaptation and more recently on genomics and gene editing icar had the benefit of scientific leaders all along the various stages of its transformational journey which is set to remain as an everevolving continuum 1 introduction the transformational narration of indian agriculture postindependence will be incomplete without the mention of the phenomenal transformation and the pivotal role played by organizational leadership of indian council of agricultural research icar in shaping the national agricultural research extension and education system nares azadi ka amrut mahotsav is an opportune time to salute the great leaders who removed the cutting blade of hunger and poverty from 16 th of the humanity on the globe indian agriculture continues to battle the formidable challenges of meeting food and nutritional requirements of increasing population from depleting and deteriorating land water and other resources that are under acute pressure due to overuse misuse and abuse however unlike in its formative years after independence the country now effectively deals with current challenges including the unforeseen ones like the covid19 pandemic several attributions can be made to this phenomenal journey of farm sector viz political will science and technology human resources investments infrastructure and the resolute and resilient farming community the organizational leadership played the catalytic role in this spectacular makeover the mid60s witnessed one of its momentous milestones the green revolution a classic case of synergy of the political scientific and bureaucratic leaders that boosted the farm production using science and technology the structural reforms to accommodate diversified views and resources like saus ars dare foreign breeding materials in the mid60s and 70s led to strengthening of icar and nares the white revolution owing to cooperative farming and crossbred breeds was another landmark blend of science and development ushering into rapid transformation in production and supply chain management of milk the institution of agricultural research service ars in 1975 and national academy of agricultural research management naarm initially called central staff college for agriculture in 1976 were significant reforms in the domain of human resource development several other institutions of excellence were established and few institutions under the state governments were brought under icar for more autonomy and locationspecific countrywide research subsequent decades saw diversification for natural resource management farm power and energy high value cropping allied sectors along with farmers outreach policy hrd and research governance leadership in agricultural research in independent india 409agricultural research in india is designed to provide affordable technologies to farmers and farm products to consumers by sustainable growth in agricultural productivity the research leader has to mobilize adequate resources from the government sources as well as from unconventional sources of the respective times to keep this growth engine moving the visionary leaders of icar have piloted the agricultural research in different phases matching to the needs of changing times the milestones of organizational leadership in the transformational journey of agricultural research are presented in table 1 table 1 milestones in the transformational journey of agricultural research in

strategic research 2011 establishment of agriinnovate india ltd agin company httpsicarorginfilesvision2020pdf 2 science leadership an overview agriculture as a sector is probably the oldest one to have research as its core segment though informally practiced by farmers and other biologists in its formative stages however as human beings started practicing growing crops and rearing animals research also started to see improvement starting in the mid19th century organized agricultural research was taking place in institutions such as the agricultural chemistry association of scotland the agricultural experiment station saxony and the land grant colleges in the united states loebenstein and thottappilly 2001 around the same time imperial council of agricultural research 1929 was established in delhi india which is known today as indian council of agricultural research icar currently several organizations and institutions are engaged in agricultural research most of the nations have national agricultural research system nars consisting of national research institutions universities independent research organizations the private sector and international research centers science leadership needs to resolve many potential areas of disconnect within research spatial or culturalsocial disconnect the time lags between conducting research and actual utilization of research outputs and outcomes for solving problems could lead to many potential disconnects more concerning is the disconnect between basic and applied research often compounded by institutional or geographic distance scientific organizations like icar engage in basic agricultural research for knowledge discovery for its prospective application to solve realtime problems research organizations have in the past had relative freedom to do this although at present with financial constraints it is progressively more difficult in some subjects to access the resources to continue basic research in agriculture basic research is an important starting point for much applied research which is concerned with specific and defined problems rather than fundamental issues the uniqueness of the leadership requirement in icar is that it is required to guide or lead the diversity of organizations and institutions performing research along this upstream fundamental research to downstream more applied research continuum and often performing a developmentextension function as well to ensure minimum duplication and maximum synergy in a global environment the system in the past was leadership in agricultural research in independent india 411greatly benefitted by outstanding visionary leaders that enabled a diverse and dynamic system to contribute immensely to food secure nation 3 role of leadership in driving the agricultural research system with changing needs following the recommendations joint indoamerican teams of 1954 and 1959 and agricultural research review team the government of india in 1963 approved the reorganization of the icar the revision of the councils rules and bylaws were effected leading to structural changes such as reconstitution of the governing body administrative control of all research institutes and commodity research institutes and appointment of a scientist as director general and vicepresident of the council dr bp pal thus appointed as the first director general of icar in may 1965 prior to this to achieve food security necessitated single agency administration and monitoring of various institutions established for that purpose the first aicrp for maize was initiated in 1957 as a result of the ministry of food and agriculture goi signing an agreement with the rockefeller foundation in 1956 the success of the coordinated maize project in india proved to be a watershed moment in agricultural research planning by 1965 icar decided to initiate coordinated projects on other crops as well as in other areas of research such as animal husbandry natural resource management and so on currently 60 coordinated projects on various subjects are in operation india pursued an agricultural development strategy that prioritized selfsufficiency in staple foods such as wheat and rice several other agrarian reforms such as the integrated production program in the 1950s were crucial initiatives mrs indira gandhi the then prime minister of india sowed the seeds of the green revolution with capable leadership of c subramaniam the then agriculture minister suitably advised by the visionary scientists dr ms swaminathan following the successes of dwarf mexican varieties developed by dr norman e borlaug the seeds of high yielding dwarf wheat varieties were allowed to be imported and demonstrated at farmers fields with irrigation as well as external inputs such as chemical fertilizer and pesticides the rest is the history it aided indias transition from a massive food importer reliant on aid to a food exporter the green revolution increased crop yields in india significantly and saved a large number of people from starvation or malnutrition dr ms swaminathan served as director general dg of the council during

agricultural scientists recruitment board asrb in 1975 along with structural changes and reforms the programmatic interventions such as labtoland and national agricultural research project narp were also launched with immense contribution made to the agriculture sector in india he has been decorated with many coveted international and national recognitions and popularly regarded as the father of indian green revolution this was the period when icarcgiar relationship started establishing which later ushered into significant outcomes the icrisat was established in india through dr swaminathans initiatives dr om prakash gautam served the council as director general during19791985 he had been instrumental in revitalizing the indian agricultural education system and making the agricultural universities as centers of excellence it was during the leadership of dr ns randhawa phase ii of the national agricultural research project was implemented with an expanded mandate covering new areas of research such as irrigated farming horticulture and commercial field crops agroforestry and animal nutrition besides development of programs for field testing and refining research results he was also instrumental in recommending the rural work experience rawe program for imparting practical oriented education module for agriculture degree program while cereals production has increased substantially after 1965 the oilseed production remained low in 1986 the government launched technology mission on oilseeds tmo and dr mv rao former special dg icar led the mission with effective coordination among various ministries departments and organizations such as icar and saus the resultant was significant turnaround in oilseed production from 1083 million tons in 198586 to 2475 million tons in 199899 india achieved nearselfsufficiency in edible oils popularly called yellow revolution 19861990 the subject matter divisions were established in icar during this period in

rural areas and provided opportunities for selfsustaining economic growth reduced poverty averting hunger for millions of people reduction in import of food grains and industrial growth pinsterp and anderson 1985 a significant contribution of green revolution is the change in the attitudes of farmers enhancing the status of agriculture from a lowlevel subsistence activity to a commercial one this contributed to the transformation of the state from food import into selfsufficiency and food export country the white revolution in india was successful in transforming the country from a milk deficient nation to a world leader in milk production it helped dairyfarming become indias largest selfsustaining industry and also indias largest rural employment provider india achieved nearselfsufficiency in edible oils from the yellow revolution and there was significant turnaround in oilseed production from 1083 million tons in 198586 to 3850 million tons in 202122 the blue revolution with its multidimensional activities focuses mainly on increasing fisheries production and productivity from aquaculture and fisheries resources inland fresh water and marine average milk egg fruit vegetable meat consumption improved over the decades leading to diversified food systems nutrition security with increased life expectancy other revolutions in the country were the outcomes of the technologies introduced and policies framed and implemented with strong backup from leadership and institutional strength of icar the icar technologies contributed in sustaining the benefits of these revolutions despite depleting and deteriorating natural resources soil water biodiversity climate as well as escalating stresses such as diseases insect pests droughts and floodsindian

organization largely depends upon the quality and quantum of work done by the scientists which required attracting talents into agricultural research with panindia personnel policies with this broad objective the union cabinet approved the agricultural research service on october 1 1975 dr ms swaminathan the then dg icar spearheaded in formation of agricultural research services ars a pan india research service for the entry level scientists the main objective of the service was to generate a scientific culture and opportunity for continuous professional growth and lifelong specialization without any constraint and to promote individual and collective initiative for improving the productivity of research and application of knowledge in matters relating to all aspects of agriculture since the introduction of ars the council has been giving continuous thought to the question of matching its personnel policies with the basic objectives of the organization and the requirements of its research programs in order to bring reforms in the ars a committee under the chairmanship of dr rs paroda former director general icar was constituted in 2010 the committee suggested a slew of measures including the merger of the disciplines creation of new disciplines broad changes in the qualifications besides the involvement of naarm in hrd for the improvement in the system the subject matter divisions were created in icar on the recommendations gvk rao committee 1988 to have interinstitutional linkages the functional autonomy was provided to the scientists following the johl committees recommendations in 1995 mashelkar committee 2005 recommendations for icar industry interface and scientistentrepreneur tieup were operationalized through national agricultural innovation

been identified as effective at individual level while websites media activities products developed print and social media presence etc have been identified as effective at institute and organization level besides aforementioned means third party involving instruments like technology licenses incubates startups etc help enhance the brand of the icar 5 leadership development focus and strategies the development of leadership has become essential for the nares due to dynamic challenges expectations from society and stakeholders and enhanced research competition from the private sector across the globe in the present context there is a serious concern for effective leadership at different levels of hierarchy 51 strategy for leadership development the councils vision for transforming the employees of icar by developing a strategic human resource management system has led to the formulation of icar hrm policy training and capacity building taking a cue from national training policy 2012 the policy has been implemented successfully through imparting competencybased training for all cadres viz scientific technical administrative including finance and accounts stenographer services and skilled supporting staffs based on training need assessment tna the council is committed to methodically implementing the policy throughout all staff cadres in the nares realizing the need for the development of leaders across the nares icar initiated capacity building through a threepronged approach by organizing a pre rmp training called management development programs executive development programs for newly recruited rmps and senior edp for experienced leaders of the council which is fortified with international exposure 52 institutional mechanism a training board chaired by the icars dg has been established to provide overall guidance for the execution of the hrm policy other members of the board include secretary icar three ddgs on rotation of three years director naarm joint secretary training dopt and adg hrm as member secretary the hrm unit of icar is the nodal agency for the coordination and implementation of this policy an exclusive hrm unit was created at the council and hrd cell at the institute level and a dedicated team of hrd nodal officers have been put in place for capacity building activities training management information system tmis is also in place there are 40 centers for advanced faculty training operational under the education division of icar for enhancing the capabilities of teachers researchers and extension specialists in educational innovations modern teaching and research methodologies as well as serving as a repository of ideas and information in relevant disciplines apart from the agricultural indian agriculture after independence 424research service scientists of icar naarm is also actively engaged in nurturing academic leadership for professors and university officers of state agricultural universities 6 conclusion the leadership vision requires a balancing approach to eliminate the professional and personal biases from the system and make the organization contextually relevant at a given period and point of time the agricultural research management and governance involves many decisions that have scientific social and political consequences which pose unique challenges to the leadership every country has established agricultural research priorities based on many complex factors that must be considered when decisions are made on the choice of research problems to be investigated resources must be shared among projects that often compete for the limited funding available that supports the total research enterprise wishes by stakeholders have to be considered as well as the aspirations of the individual researcher in addition a system of incentives for the researcher and his technicians to promote first class research within the mandate of the institute will promote their output advancement based on merit and achievements is a necessity also in government institutes not to be bound by regular civil service regulations these have to be handled by independent promotion committees including scientists from other institutions to prevent favoritism agricultural rd policies and management particularly need be dictated and conducted b y scientists who are familiar with the biotic abiotic and socioeconomic constraints of crop production in developing countries historical and political issues or lobbying from pressure groups should not interfere with the mission of producing more and healthier food for the poor rural and urban sectors of the world in a sustainable way these challenges coupled with growing expectations from the stakeholders and society at large and increasing competition within the system as well as outside regional and global and relentless technology boom necessitate newer forms of leadership as well as organization and management om reforms to ensure that our nares continues to remain relevant and effective in dealing with such dynamic ecosystem icar in its long journey so far has seen many challenges and ably addressed them and met the expectations to a large extent by forwardlooking and yet realistic measures the contemporary organizational leadership however it has to evolve a more dynamic human resource management strategy for effective utilization of the critical scientific mass for targeted outcomes more specific to r4d with the growing challenges in the spheres of science technology fund financing policy governance and an everdynamic societal ecosystem where the farming community is increasingly becoming aspirational the professional competence matrix required for leading an organization of the size of icar is set to turn more complex however given the talent pool the system has cultivated by attracting and retaining best talents in the organization gives adequate assurance that the organizational leadership is set to remain as an everevolving constant for the effectiveness of icar and nares leadership in agricultural research in independent india 425references borthakur s and
