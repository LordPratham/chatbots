dwarf wheat that brought the great green revolution in india during the sixties one third of the indian population depends on wheat as their main food india is the second largest producer of wheat after china claiming the position of a significant stakeholder in global wheat production during the xi plan period 200708 to 201112 the country experienced steep increase in total foodgrains production being one of the major contributors of countrys total foodgrains production wheat production was recorded to be 935 million tonnes reaped th from an area of 2965 million ha with a productivity level of 3119 kgha 4 adv estimate of goi 201213 the level of production was further augmented to an all time record figure of 9585 million tonnes during rd the year 201314 3 adv estimate of govt of india the directorate of wheat development ghaziabad has pooled information from various sources and brought out this publication status paper on wheat covering various aspects of cropping season zonal classification viz 6 zones spread over the entire country levels of crop production pests and disease management varietal development post harvest status and export status etc in respect of wheat besides status of various ongoing schemes and programmes of the government for enhancing production and productivity of wheat in the country that have been documented in the publication my

is therefore attracts the attention of our policy maker scientists development worker grower and marketing agencies in terms of production and productivity are concerned india ranks second in terms of production and is presently reaping record production of 9585 million ton from an area of about 30 million ha the giant leap of production per se had been the consolidated efforts of the farms at the top and the development workers policy makers and scientists th although there had been the quantum jump in production during the 11 five year plan there remaining a dearth of availability adequate information in a complied form to refer question raised ever now and then by individual in every sector about the status of wheat variety there suitability to different climatic zones the recommended packages and practices the pest and disease problem and storage and marketing have forced us to comment us a bunch of information the problems of yellow rust of wheat have been a great threat to wheat as it may be adequately stated that more yield more threats of rust directorate of wheat development have been actively involved in collaboration with the directorate of wheat research icar karnal and states to carry out survey and surveillance in various parts of the country including ladakh region for the past few years the growing awareness among the growers may thus be envisaged as the outcome of such survey and surveillance directorate of wheat development ghaziabad is indebted to dr j s sandhu agriculture commissioner shri mukesh khullar former joint secretary crops shri sanjay lohiya

worldwide the three species of wheat namely triticum aestivum bread wheat triticum durum macaroni wheat and triticum dicoccum emmer or khapli wheat grown on commercial basis in the indian subcontinent from prehistoric times with share of production in percent 95 4 and 1 respectively are being cultivated in the country wheat is a very adaptable crop and is grown under the wide range of soil climatic 0 0 0 conditions the crop is most successfully grown between latitude of 30n 60n and between 27 0 s 40s in india it is grown mostly in the plains where as in the hills it is cultivated in mountainous region of north india nilgiris and palani hills in south india for convenience of testing finding out the correct adaptability the country is divided into six different wheat growing zones namely northern hill zone nhz north western plains zone nwpz north eastern plains zone nepz central zone cz peninsular zone pz and southern hill zone shz the zone wise total percentage of acreages of wheat crop are 29 401 332 181 54 and 04 respectively wheat is used by human beings in form of flour for making chapaties semolina and pasta products it is also used for preparation of bread biscuits cookies cracks noodles dalia maida vermicelli etc wheat straw is also used for the animal feed as fodder and for packaging materials the wheat contains nearly carbohydrates 70 protein 12 fat 17 minerals 27 fiber 2 and moisture 12 wheat is worlds leading cereal crop cultivated near about 2166 million hectares with a production of 67488 million tonnes of grain with 3115 kgha productivity 201213 india 2990

yield of wheat in the world per hectare france 75 qtlsha ranks first followed by germany 73 qtlsha wheat triticum spp is the second most important winter cereal in india after rice the share of wheat in total food grain production is around 3625 and share in area is about 2483 of the total area under food grains the area under wheat during 201314 was 3113 million ha with rd a production of 9585 million tonnes and productivity of 306qtlha 3 advance estimates 201314 dac about 995 of the wheat production comes from uttar pradesh punjab haryana madhya pradesh rajasthan bihar maharashtra gujarat karnataka west bengal executive summar y iuttarakhand himachal pradesh and jammu kashmir and remaining contributed by rest of the states the total production increased to the magnitude of more than six folds from roughly 123 million metric tons in 196465 to an estimated 9585 million metric tons in 201314 this feat was achieved as a result of a strong research back up that facilitated the development of improved high yielding varieties of wheat resistant to diseases with stable performance all india coordinated wheat improvement project aicwip working in close collaboration with rockfellar foundation as was desired by dr norman e borlaug it recognizes and overviews interdisciplinary collaborations between various cooperating centers and helps to promote close inter institutional linkages international and intranational exchange of materials and is finding solution to specific problems the main strength and approach of aicwip is multidisciplinary and multilocational type of comprehensive research and testing of newly developed genotypes besides taking care of germplasms evaluation through various national and international nurseries the real breakthrough in wheat revolution started after introduction of mexican varieties and breeding materials in the country and free flow of material to the wheat coordinating centres since its inception of 1965 the wheat programme both the central varietal release committee cvrc and state varietal release committee svrc has released about 375 wheat varieties so far out of these 316 were bread wheat 49 durum wheat and 5 dicoccum wheat besides 5 triticales were developed the genetic breakthrough of indian wheat research achieved during the pre and post green revolution era such as terminal heat tolerance adult plant resistance apr and durable rust resistance drr karnal bunt resistant kbr genetic adaptation of wheat to salt tolerance genetic biofortification use of transgenic and gene exchange and hybridization etc the sole responsibility for production of breeder seeds is coming under the preview of indian council of agricultural research icar state agricultural universities saus further the responsibility for production of foundation and certified seeds are by state seeds corporationsstate department of agriculture to the extent of 40 of the requirement national level seed agencies have the responsibility of 40 private seed sectors have the responsibilities of remaining 20 of the requirement the present average seed replacement rate srr of wheat crop is about 326 2011 against the targeted 33 this is because of the fact that large quantities of farm saved seeds are being used by the wheat farmers across the country wheat is grown mainly in cropping sequences like ricewheat jowarwheat bajra wheat maizewheat pulsewheat cottonwheat soybeanwheat etc in different parts of the country under irrigated condition under rainfed condition fallowwheat is most common iibut sometimes short duration pulse crops may precede wheat in assured rainfall areas some of the important problems are depletion of ground water resources decline in soil fertility decline in factor productivity rising problem of insectpest and disease complex and shift in weed flora northw estern parts of the indogangetic plain igp suggested for infusion of a complimentary set of new agricultural technologies to boost productivity growth these resource conserving technologies rct s such as zero and rotary tillage furrow irrigated raised bed firb surface seeding which are sustaining and enhancing the productivity of the ricewheat system at reduced cost of production are backedup by the new research findings conducted in participation with farmers to facilitate procurement of food grains food corporation of india fci and various state agencies in consultation with the state govt establish a large number of purchase centres at various mandis and key points the govt policy of procurement of food grains has the broad objectives of ensuring minimum support price msp to the farmers and also ensuring availability of food grains to the weaker sections at affordable prices about 28023 lakh tonnes wheat has been procured on msp rs 1400 per quintal by the various procurement agencies of the country during the marketing year 201415 with a view to supplement the efforts of the state departments of agriculture in increasing the production and productivity the ministry of agriculture govt of india are implementing national food security mission

of the staple foods of north indian population wheat grains are ground in to flour atta and consumed mostly in the form of chapati or leavened bread soft wheat is used for making chapati bread cake biscuits pastr y and other bakery products whereas hard wheat is used for manufacturing rawa suji and sewaya in areas where rice is a staple food grain wheat is also eaten in the form of puri etc it is also used for making cakes and sweet meats etc wheat grain is used for preparing starch wheat straw is used as fodder padding material and mulching material 14 morpholo gy wheat is an annual plant belonging to the family poaceae gramineae 141 roots wheat plant consists of two sets of roots viz seminal roots and clonal roots crown roots seminal roots arise from germinating seedlings and the crown roots arise from the basal node of plant the crown roots form the permanent root system while the seminal roots dry after about 30 days of the seedling emerg ence 142 stem wheat stem culm is erect cylindrical jointed and smooth the solid joints are termed as nodes which separate the plant into sections known as internodes and these nodesinter nodes are differentiated when plants star t elong ating the lo wer inter nodes are shor ter while the upper ones are progressively long er the main culm produces branc hes at the base close to the ground called the tillers primar y and the tillers produce the additional tillers known as secondar y and tertiary tillers 143 leaves wheat leaves consist of two parts the leaf sheath which encircles the stem and the blade that bends away from

202021 as against an anticipated actual production or projected supply of 93104 million tones thereb y indicating a huge mark etable surplus of wheat in the countr y rd it was revealed during the deliberations in the 53 all india wheat workshop 2014 that annual producti vity growth rate of wheat during post 2000 period is about 16 whic h is also confir med by a publication on medium term outlook by ncaer 2013 the existing or projected population growth during the period 20102050 would be 08 besides there is a decline in the status of stagnation in wheat producti vity obser ved after 199899 as such with this annual output growth of 16 till 2050 the per capita availability shall be just 34 which is envisag ed to be the requirement to maintain the sustainability of wheat production the present challeng e is therefore to sustain this 16 g rowth till 2050 t he comparati ve analysis of demand and supply scenario involving both historical and projections towards 2050 indicated that india may achieve the targeted 140 million tonnes of wheat by 2050 for which there is the requirement of maintaining at least 1 rd annual growth rate in wheat producti vity over 201213 and 201314 53

far north beyond even othe 60 north altitude wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in warm weather in spring it can be cultivated from sea level to an altitude of 3300 meters the most favourable climatic condition for wheat cultivation is cool and moist weather during the vegetative growth period followed by dr y war m weather for the g rain to ma ture and

maturity and yield loss an un report anon 2011 stated that the earth will be warmer 0 by 24c by the year 2020 and the crop yield in india may fall by upto 30 by then instances in india are there indicating that the terminal heat creates a significant yield reduction in wheat therefore maintaining the optim um sowing time and growing ideal cultivars may manag e the problem to some extent conventional breeding processes generally aimed at diseases resistance quality impro vement and ultimately yield enhancement in view of the climate chang e impact particularly that of temperature rise these breeding programmes need to be focused to develop heat tolerant varieties low temperature during the initial stage and high temperature at later maturity stage lead to the completion of major part of wheat growth cycle table 41 t emperature requirements at different growth stages 10in the north western india it has been obser ved that considering every gain weighs 40 mg every degree c rise 0 in mean temperature during the terminal reproducti ve phase beyond 17c causes a loss of yield to the tune of 25qha this is due to the fact that the crucial advanced reproducti ve phase is affected by rising temperature results in poor grain filling shorter earhead lesser 1000 grain weight and ultimately lower production 42 recommendation for cultivation of wheat in view of climatic change due to climate chang e there is an overall reduction in crop yield and the various crop production stages right from sowing to harvesting and threshing are badly affected it ultimately causes decline in water resources and soil organic matter some preventive measures given as below for minimize the loss by climatic chang e modification in agronomy of crop manipulation of sowing datesoptimisation to

so high 20003000 plants m2 that farmers are forced to harvest the wheat crop as fodder 30isoproturon arelon was recommended for the control of phalaris min or in 1980s it remained effectiv e for almost a decade but sole dependence on this herbicide resulted in the development of resistance to isoproturon in controlling phalaris minor in zero tillag e fields the intensity of rumex and malw a parviflora is increasing and intending to become a problem in the coming years therefore there is the requirement of strict vigilance regarding weed flora shift due to chang es in tillage practices 782 weed mana gement practices various practices of weed manag ement can be grouped into three broad categ ories namely cultural and preventive physical or mechanical and chemical weed control these practices are as under 7821 cultural and preventive cultural practices such as time and method of sowing crop density and geometr y crop varieties dose method and time of fertilizer application time and method of irrigation have pronounced effect on cropw eed interference some of these factors are use of clean wheat seeds that is free from weed seeds early sowing of wheat before 15 nov adoption of closer row spacing 18 cm adoption of criscross sowing to increase population density of the wheat plants placement of basal dose of fertilizer 23 cm below the seed sowing of wheat on furrow irrigated raised bed system firbs to reduce weed population pulling out weeds before seed setting for curbing seed bank of weeds keeping bunds irrigation channels free from weeds introduction of either berseem or oat for fodder as a crop rotation and sown once in three years stimulate emerg ence of phalaris by giving light irrigation followed by weed control with nonselecti ve herbicides like glyphosate or cultivation followed by sowing of wheat zero tillage offer a way to manag e phalaris and grow fast growing and robust varieties of wheat for smothering impact on weeds 7822 mechanical contr ol removal of weeds by various tools implements including hand weeding it is not feasible where weeds resemble morphologically to crop eg p minor avena ludoviciana before flowering also mechanical weed control becomes difficult in broadcast sown wheat however mechanical control can be practiced effecti vely when wheat is sown on firbs as this system facilitates tractor mounted implements usage 7823 chemical contr ol chemical weed control is in practice because of less labour involvement and no mechanical damag e to the crop that happens during manual weeding hence cost effecti ve moreo ver the control is more effecti ve as the weeds even within the rows are killed which invariably escape because of morphological similarity to wheat during mechanical control the following weedicides schedule has been found effecti ve in controlling the isoproturon resistant population of phalaris minor out of the four new herbicides found effecti ve against phalaris two namely sulfosulfuran and metribuzin w ere effecti ve against both grassy and nong rassy w eeds whereas clodinafop and fenoxaprop were specific to grassy weeds the recommended herbicides for

potential status in certain cases input use patter n reflects progressive increase in nutrient demand more application of pesticides and also strain on water front this implies that input use efficiency is decreasing with simultaneous increase in cost of production the higher cost of production in any crop increases the risk probabilities the net income from ricew heat cropping system is declining and farmers are finding hard to maintain their per unit economic retur ns reduction in cost of production through various means viz operational costs involving land preparation mechanization in sowing intercultural and harvestingthreshing including resource conser vation technologies in conser vation agriculture practices may augment the farmers income out of their crop fields circumstances farmers tend to act on the advice of dealers are adding complexity to the situation this situation is further deteriorated by monoculture some of impor tant issues are incidence of rusts stripe rust has been growing a major concer n occurs only in the peak growing season of the crop massi ve awareness and spray operations of propiconazole including growing resistant varieties of wheat answ ers the threat spraying of propiconazole and tebuconazole in alternate seasons are also recommended to escape any build up of resistance karnal bunt is another problem that comes on the way of achieving higher producti vity and mark eting resistant varieties have been developed but the wheat fields where the disease occur red have been suggested to be kept out of wheat cultivation at least for three years and simultaneously soil and seed treatment need to be carried out even in other nearb y areas vproblem of weeds and their mana gement weed is one of the major biotic constraints in wheat production as they compete for nutrients moisture light and space weeds are associated with specific crops and the most critical stage of cropw eed competition remains within 3035 days after

liberal use of nitrog enous fertilizers and constant favourable condition becomes a paradise for building up an insectpest and disease complex under the 38tempting to grow rice under suboptimal conditions which is more damaging to the quality of natural resources delay in harvest of rice further delays sowing of wheat that results in yield reduction while retaining rice in kharif season

profitable as well as soil fertility impro vement in case where rice is yet to be kept in the cropping system as inevitable introduction of direct seeded rice dsr may be the ultimate option to arrest the resource depletion intercropping wheat in sugarcane is another viable option sugarcane alone is a remunerati ve crop and also there is enough scope of addition of wheat through intercropping gro wing wheat after sug arcane also existed in areas lik e western up and is also a profitable cropping system the system is therefore found to create yield enhancement of wheat and ultimately enhance the total income of the farmers 85 means to stabilize and sustain the ricewheat cropping system there has been depletion of natural resources in rwcs and also in reversible limits thus sustainability of the system is in question the necessar y measures are therefore need to be taken to stabilize the system some of the measures are as under azero tilla ge zero tillage as breakthrough in wheat cultivation the long duration rice cultivation before wheat usually overlaps the following wheat season thereb y induces delayed sowing of wheat zero tillage reduces the time taken for land preparation besides economizing the cost of production resulting in increasing the margin of profit for the wheat growers additionally wed infestation is also reduced in zero tillage areas bgreen manuring there is a fallow period of 4550 days betw een har vest of wheat an d transplanting of rice which is sufficient to raise a very good green manure crop though any leguminous crop can be used for green 1 manuring but sesbania aculeata is best fit it grows well even on marginal soils could accum ulate about 250 q ha 1 biomass in seven weeks its incor poration in the soil can contribute 6080 kg n ha the carbon and nitrog en ratio is ideal for rapid decomposition and nitrog en availability is as fast as from urea green manuring alone is sufficient to meet all the nitrog en need of basmati

of harvested wheat grains wheat is main staple food for majority population hence stored from one season to the other safe storage facilitates better price realization 25 per cent by extending marketing duration there are many factors influencing storage loss in wheat which are moisture temperature insects rodents quality status before storage types of storage bincontainers sanitation use of fumigantspesticides type of damage before storing the grain like fress and webbing exit holes darkened kernels and damaged kernels mechanical factors and other general conditions like location of storage etc harvested grains normally contain 20 per cent moisture for safe storage maintenance of around 1214 per cent grain moisture content is recommended higher moisture content resulted in musty odour discolouration and lower flour yield it is therefore necessary that an equilibrium moisture content for wheat around 13 per cent at 70 per cent rh relative humidity be maintained for longer duration storage rolling in to years the grain moisture should be 11 to 12 per cent coupled with suitable treatment for stored grain pests diseases indian farmers retain more than 50 per cent of their harvested grains for human consumption cattle feed seed etc grains are generally stored in simple granaries constructed from locally available materials like paddy straw split bamboo reeds mud and
