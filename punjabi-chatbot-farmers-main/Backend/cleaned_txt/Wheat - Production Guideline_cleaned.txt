originated in the near east in the areas now occupied by syria turkey afghanistan iraq and iran grains of domesticated wheat were found in the archaeological remains in ali koshi in iranian khusistan dating back to 6 500 bc as well as in anatolia in turkey dating back to 5 500 bc cultivation of wheat spread from its origin to india pakistan and china in the east to the mediterranean countries in the west and the ussr and other countries in the north in south africa jan van riebeeck introduced it in the middle of the 17th century upon arrival in the cape in 1652 thereafter it spread to the western cape south western cape and free state provinces knowledge of t aestivums cultivation origin has been lost the precise origin of the wheat plant as we know it today is not known wheat evolved from wild grasses probably somewhere in the near east a very likely place of origin is the area known in early historical times as the fertile crescenta region with rich soils in the upper reaches of the tigriseuphrates drainage basin 3 production levels in south africa wheat is an important cereal crop ranking second after maize in terms of the area planted and production it is grown on an area which ranges from 417 500 to 757 700 ha on total average area of 533 000 ha during production seasons from 2004 to 2015 which produces an average annual production of 13 to 2 million tons however the most significant decline in hectares occurred in free state which resulted in a 50 drop in production production in the irrigation and winter wheat areas were also down but only marginally the provinces that produce wheat are free state followed by the western cape and northern cape other provinces produce smaller amounts the total requirement for wheat in south africa is 27 million tons which is higher than the total production in order for south africa to meet its requirements wheat is imported from argentina united states of america germany canada ukraine and the united kingdom annual wheat production in south africa ranges from 13 to 2 million tha at the rate of 2 to 25 tha under dryland and about 5 tha under irrigation production guideline for wheat2 the south western parts of the western cape swartland and ruens contribute about 697 000 northern cape about 262 800 tons free state about 224 000 tons northwest about 91 500 tons mpumalanga about 20 300 tons limpopo

small quantities have been reported in the eastern cape and gauteng province 5 cultivars cultivar choice is an economic and important production decision by which the producer aims to achieve highest return with the lowest risk and if correctly planned could contribute greatly to reducing risk and optimising yields it is important for farmers to realise that there are cultivars for dryland and irrigation planting producers should also plant cultivars that are preferred by the miller the decision is complicated by all the different factors that contribute to the adaptability yield potential grading and quality diseases and pests seed price hectoliter mass straw strength aluminium tolerance photoperiod and vernalisation shatterproof and preharvest sprouting tolerance agronomic characteristics and disease risks of the current commercially available cultivars the correct cultivar choice contributes to management of risk and achieving optimal grain yield in a given situation a few important guidelines to consider when the producer is deciding on cultivar choice are plant a few different cultivars so as to spread production risks especially in terms of drought and disease occurrence utilise the optimum planting spectrum of the cultivars in an area do not within one season replace tested cultivars with a new and unknown cultivar rather plant the new cultivar alongside the stalwart for at least one season to compare them and to get to know the new cultivar cultivars that are able to adapt to specific yield potential conditions should be chosen revise cultivar choice annually so as to adapt to changing circumstances and especially to consider new cultivars the national chamber of milling annually publishes a list of preferred cultivars that are acceptable for commercial purposes and this list must be considered in cultivar choice the chamber of milling does however point out that individual millers choices are not restricted to the list the list of preferred cultivars is divided into three categories cultivars for dryland production in the north cultivars for the southern production area and the irrigation cultivars millers preference list of

kariega 6 description of the plant mature plant wheat is an annual grass with basic erect hollow or pithy culms the plant can grow up to 12 m tall the leaves are flat and narrow while they can extend up to 38 cm long the spikes are long slender dorsally compressed and somewhat flattened the rachis is tough and not separated from the spikelet at maturity the spikelets have two to five flowers which are relatively far apart on the stem and slightly overlapping they are also erect and pressed close to the rachis the glumes which are firm glabrous and shorter than the lemmas appear on the upper half of the spikelets the lemmas may either be awned or awnless and less than 13 cm long the palea is as long as the lemma and remains entirely green until maturity the caryopsis may either be soft or hard and red or white and it frees easily with threshing 7 climatic requirements temperature warm temperatures are suitable for summer wheat 22 c to 34 c and cool temperatures are suitable for winter wheat 5 c to 25 c an ideal climate for planting wheat can be described as cool and moist followed by a warm dry season for harvesting such a climate is encountered mostly in winter rainfall areas in south africa wherein most of the country receives summer rainfall winter wheat production is dependent on sufficient residual soil moisture 8 rainfall requirements the water requirement for wheat is about 600 mm per annum in dry areas where cultivation practices such as zero tillage and minimum tillage are practiced stubble mulching is recommended for moisture conservation frost can damage wheat especially after the formation of ears in spring resulting in low yield hail can also result in serious damage on the summer wheat resulting in low yield wet weather during harvesting contributes to disease prevalence and quality deterioration of grains almost all cultivars are susceptible to preharvest sprouting and must be harvested as soon as possible to prevent low falling number or sprouting of the crop wheat that is not harvested in time can quickly deteriorate in terms of quality reduced hectolitre mass and become infected with fungi mould indicated by a change of colour in the ears golden yellow to white to black hail during or after emergence of the ear can cause severe yield loss and the only recourse farmers have is to take out insurance against hail damage the moisture application under irrigation should be lowered during flowering increased during pod filling and ceased during ripening planting each cultivar within the recommended planting time for each area will help to minimise the risk of damage by climatic factors such as drought heat cold and rain as all recommended cultivars are tested over many seasons in each environment keeping to recommendations will offer the best chance of getting a successful harvest 9 soil requirements wheat requires welldrained fertile loamy to sandy loam with a ph of 6 0 to 75 soil temperatures of less than 5 c are not suitable for seed germination wheat is adversely affected by acidic soils which are associated with high al3 content particularly during the early development stages of the crop the acidic ph makes other soil nutrients to be fixed or to become unavailable leading to a need for liming wheat is also sensitive to very high salinity that can occur under irrigation and some highly saline soils are not suitable for production for dryland production in the summer rainfall region special soils with large water holding capacity are needed to ensure sufficient soil water storage these soils must be able to store at least 180 mm water before planting and mostly consist of the duplex soil types soil types such as avalon westleigh clovelly longlands and pinedine have a heavy clay layer or barrier layer that prevents stored water from draining and are therefore suitable for soil water storage very well drained soils like hutton soil type deep red soils are not suitable for dryland production but very suitable if irrigation can be appliedproduction guideline for wheat6 cultivation practices 1 propagation wheat is propagated by seeds 2 soil preparation soil tillage is one of the most important production practices over which the farmer has full control the effect of tillage cannot be predicted for any season therefore the farmer has to plan his actions to solve specific problems unnecessary cultivations cost money time and effort while valuable soil water is lost in the process such cultivations also cause recompaction that has to be addressed later minimum tillage 75 mm to 130 mm deep deep tillage 150 mm to 300 mm or no till can be practiced depending on the type of the soil moisture availability type of cultivar and the previous crop planted for the summer wheat production that is under irrigation immediately after harvesting the previous crop in may the land is ploughed disked and planted wheat no fallow period is allowed only two weeks in between is used for field operations the conventional tillage is recommended for wheat on wheat cropping systems in which the risk of root disease is high and the risk of wind and water erosion minimal the harvesting is done in december to january as soon as soil conditions allow disking of the soil is done ploughing is done between ends of january to end of february in the drier areas and between midfebruary to the end of march in the wetter areas 3 field layout and design firm smooth welldrained fields should be selected the fields should be free from weeds stones and waterlogged conditions contour ridges ridges field waterways terraces or windbreaks should be introduced to the field to prevent wind and water erosion avoid using fields where wheat was planted the previous or same year 4 planting wheat is planted under dryland and irrigation conditions in the summer rainfall region while in the winter rainfall region it is planted under dryland conditions only it is planted mainly between midapril and midjune in the winter rainfall areas western and southern cape and between midmay and the end of july in the summer rainfall areas eastern free state seeding rate ranges from 20 kgha to 25 kgha under dryland conditions conversely the seeding rate ranges from 90 kgha to 120 kgha under irrigation conditions the interrow and intrarow spacing are 40 cm to 50 cm and 7 cm to 15 cm respectively when using a planter seed should be placed 5 cm deep always use treated seed for soilborne fungal diseases control the seed should be planted evenly and shallowly in a moist firm seedbed germination emergence and development of adventitious roots occur within four to six weeks after planting under proper soil conditions the required depth for seeding is 2 to 5 cm the required spacing in the row is about 30 cm and 50 cm to 100 cm between the rows depending on the available soil moisture or the farming method wide rows under dryland and narrow rows under irrigation a notill planter can be used for seeding or a planter fitted with tines can be used for planting the planting density ranges from 20 kgha to 100 kgha depending on the type of cultivar and the moisture availability lime can also be used to correct the soil ph under acidic soil mgco3 or caco3 can be used to correct the soil ph the rate will depend on the available mg or ca in the soil 5 fertilisation fertilisation in the winter rainfall region the contribution of plant nutrition to the total production cost for wheat in the swartland wheat producing area may be well in excess of 30 the soil tillage method may have an effect on both the efficient use of fertiliser applications and nmineralisation that contributes to the cost of plant nutrition efficient use of fertiliser is affected by fertiliser placement uptake and root distribution to improve their uptake fertilisers such as phosphorus that do not move easily in the soil must be placed near the roots efficient root distribution is affected by soil strengthproduction guideline for wheat7 nmineralisation of the soil is determined by climate soil conditions and method of soil tillage nmineralisation in the soil could provide large quantities of nitrogen in crop rotation systems which include legume plants and systems such as conservation farming where microbial activity in the soil is high although aggressive mouldboard ploughing may enhance nmineralisation on the short term negative effects on soil structure organic content and soil microbial activity may result in a reduction on the long term effect of crop rotation method of soil

stopped too early and the last irrigation must be applied when the whole plant is almost discoloured this is to ensure an even ripening and to produce grain with a high percentage plumpness and acceptable nitrogen content proper irrigation scheduling can also minimise lodging and disease occurrence and optimise yield quality the method of irrigation will depend on the water availability and the available irrigation equipmentproduction guideline for wheat10 7 pest control a variety of insects with different feeding habits are found on wheat but not all these pests are equally harmful therefore the decision to control should be made individually for each pest using the guidelines provided and the particular control measure should be chosen to give the best results in both economic and environmental terms the correct identification of pests is of utmost importance to ensure that the appropriate control measure is followed a field guide for the identification of insects in wheat is available from the arcsmall grain institute and also information on the registered insecticides pests in the winter rainfall regions and irrigation aphids aphid species causing problems in the winter rainfall area are mainly oat aphid the english grain aphid and rose grain aphid russian wheat aphid which is the most severe wheat aphid in sa is a sporadic pest in this area the former aphids prefer thick plant densities with damp conditions which are typical of the winter rainfall regions as well as irrigated fields during dry conditions in this area aphid numbers are low with the exception of the russian wheat aphid which prefers dry conditions other insect pests bollworm helicoverpa armigera the presence of bollworm is generally noticed only once the larvae have reached the midinstar stage inside the awns young larvae of early season generations initially feed on the chlorophyll of leaves later migrating into the awn to feed on the developing kernels producers should scout their fields in order to detect the younger larvae as the older more matured larvae are generally less susceptible to insecticides and obviously cause more damage compared with small larvae chemical intervention can be considered when five to eight larvae per square meter are present however producers should take care in applying the correct dose of registered insecticide under weather conditions conducive to insect control grain chinch bug macchaidemus diplopterus or grain stinkbug damage is more pronounced under warm dry conditions as stressed plants have less ability to toleraterecover from chinch bug damage there are no insecticides registered against this insect on wheat grain slug lema erythrodera the symptoms include a white longitudinal stripe development on damaged leaves currently no insecticides are registered on wheat black sand mite or redlegged earth mite halotydeus destructor symptoms silvery white scars adjacent to the main vein of especially older leaves high infestations could lead to dying off of small plants a single systematic insecticide is registered although no threshold value is available 72 pests in the summer rainfall regions five aphid species are commonly found on wheat in the summer rainfall production areas in sa the russian wheat aphid diuraphis noxia is the most important with outbreaks occurring annually while the other aphids namely green bug schizaphis graminum birdcherry oat aphid rhopalosiphum padi and brown ear aphid metopolophium dirhodum occurs sporadically generally russian wheat birdcherry oat aphid

wheat diseases such as eyespot takeall and crown rot as well as weeds such as gut brome and ryegrass are important grain yield limiting factors in the western and southern cape it is a wellknown fact that crop rotation with leguminous crop is the most efficient method of controlling these problems in such systems the effective chemical control of grass weeds in the nongrass crop is essential should monoculture however be practiced these problems can be curtailed by burning the residue or by deep mouldboard ploughing owing to the high costs associated with mouldboard ploughing the first alternative is preferred the continuous burning of stubble residue will however increase the erodibility of the soil and damage the soil structure for this reason it must be applied judicially weeds limit grain yields by approximately 20 annually by alternating the crops and changing herbicides it is possible to control a wider spectrum of weeds effective weed control in one crop often means that the following crop can be grown without the need of expensive selective herbicides rotating crops and herbicides reduce the potential for herbicide resistance to develop in target species for example wild oats this can also reduce the potential for herbicide residue accumulation in the soil production guideline for wheat12 diseases of small grains in the winter rainfall regions disease group

applicable in case of spring and summer wheat only fully ripened grains should be harvested harvesting should commence at 16 grain moisture content while lower moisture contents up to 13 are preferred for storage the shattering types must be harvested earlier and dried artificially harvesting methods a machine called a combine is used to cut separate and clean the grain a combine must be properly adjusted to minimise grain losses special tools were developed for harvesting wheat reaping the sickle and scythe are tools that are used to cut and harvest wheat in the past mechanical reapers eventually replaced the hand tools threshing this is the separating of the grain or seeds from the plant material the cutting and threshing process was combined into one machine called the combine it can cut wheat thresh out the grain and store it in a bin on the machine winnowing is the process of separating threshed grain from the chaff postharvest handling sorting sorting should be done after harvesting ensuring that all seeds of wheat must be free of any toxin chemical or other substances that renders it unsuitable for commercial purposes provided that not more than 10 microgramme per kilogramme aflatoxin of which not more than 5 microgramme per kilogramme will be aflatoxin b1 is permissible contain no more noxious seeds or ergot sclerotia than permitted in terms of the foodstuffs

during the grain filling period to maturity and also by management practices which include soil water and fertiliser management schematic presentation of classes and grades of bread wheat grading

class durum wheat storage wheat should be stored in the silos or dry conditions after harvest in order to avoid damage by moisture pests high and very low temperatures when the produce dry and cool physiological process fungal and insect activities are low storage of wheat may take many forms depending on the market price some farmers prefer to store wheat in their farms for some time while studying the markets others sell their harvests on contracts or spot price through safex some farmers may prefer to store their wheat at the silos at a predetermined rate however in most cases the harvest is sold to millers by the time it is transported to the silos the following are conditions that need to be taken into consideration when storing wheat crops a immature or damaged seed cannot survive for long storage periods seed should be harvested when properly matured b mechanical injury to seed during harvesting makes it more susceptible to deterioration in storage c seed must be properly dried before going into storage and protected from moisture and high humidity d insects should be controlled by a combination of insecticides and fumigants phostoxin is the safest while methyl bromide may affect the produce e controlled and airtight storage atmosphere is of utmost importanceproduction guideline for wheat17 transport wheat has to be transported to the silos after harvest rail trucks and road trucks can be used to transport wheat locally and ships may be used for exporting and importing marketing the south african wheat market was deregulated on 1 november 1997 and wheat can therefore be traded freely all grain producers traders and processors are now able to trade in a free market responding to forces of worldwide supply and demand in setting prices the only government intervention in the market is the tariff on wheat imports the wheat prices are influenced by factors such as international wheat prices the strengthening of the rand against other currencies international and local wheat supply and weather conditions the market price is also directed by the future level of prices of different commodities and the expected increase in demand of wheat owing to the biofuel project and the fact that south africa is importing wheat from other countries for consumption farmers can sell their wheat on contracts through safex while the wheat is in the field the wheat marketing season in south africa commences on 1 october and ends on 30 september the following year part iv production schedules activities january february march april may june

food worldwide history shows that the first people to consume wheat probably did so 17 000 years ago by chewing kernels of the wild grain today the best known and most widely cultivated wheat is used for grain either whole or ground fine ground wheat is the source of flour for the worlds breadmaking industry in south africa wheat is mainly used for human consumption with a small portion as animal feed grain is also a source of alcoholic beverages in some parts of the world industrial utilisation other countries produce industrial alcohol into synthetic rubber and explosives starch is used for pastes and sizing textiles straw is made into mats carpets baskets and used for packing material cattle bedding and paper manufacturing scientists are studying ways to use wheat for other nonfood products such as medicines makeup and biodegradable plastics livestock feed bran from flour milling is an important livestock feed while germ is a valuable addition to feed concentrate grain can be fed to livestock whole or coarsely ground some wheat is cut for hay wheat grown for grain is also used for pasture before the stems elongate and as a temporary pasturage it is nutritious and
