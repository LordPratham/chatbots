module 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 251agriculture in india social sciencenotes 12 agricul ture in india in the previous lessons we have studied physiography climate and natural vegetation in india now we will study about agriculture which is the backbone of indian economy in india around 70 of the population earn s its livelihood from agriculture it still provides livelihood to the people in our country it fulfills the basic need of human beings and animals it is an important source of raw material for many agro based industries india s geographical condition is unique for agriculture because it provides many favourable conditions there are plain areas fertile soil long growing season and wide variation in climatic condition etc apart from unique geographical conditions india has been consistently making innovative efforts by using science and technology to increase production in this lesson we will discuss about various types of farming cropping patterns and establish their relationship with various geographical factors we will also discuss some of the major issues and challenges faced by indian agriculture in this lesson objectives after studying this lesson you will be able to circle6explain various types of farming in india circle6describe salient features of indian agriculture circle6list the major crops grown in india along with their utility circle6establish relationship of crops with the types of soil and climatic conditions circle6locate major crop producing areas on the outline map of india and circle6analyse challenges faced by farmers in indian agriculture 121 types of farming in india you know that india has diversified topography you have already learnt about it in the lesson on physiography of india the country has himalayan mountain ranges social sciencemodule 2 agriculture in india india natural environ ment resources and development 252notes extending from jammu and kashmir in the west to arunachal pradesh in the north east they have hill ranges in the form of eastern ghats and western ghats do you know india has one of the largest plain areas of the world in the form of indo ganga plain central part of india is dominated by plateau area apart from variation in landform the country has varieties of climatic condition s and soil types these physical variations along with other factors like availability of irrigation use of machinery modern agricultural inputs like high yielding varieties hyv of seeds insecticides and pesticides have played their respective roles in the evolution of different farming practices in india some of the major types of farming are discussed below 1subsistence and commercial farming majority of farmers in india practises subsistence farming this means farming for own consumption in other words the entire production is largely consumed by the farmers and their family and they do not have any surplus to sell in the market in this type of farming landholdings are small and fragmented cultivation techniques are primitive and simple in other words there is a total absence of modern equipments like tractors and farm inputs like chemical fertilizers insecticides and pesticides in this farming farmers mostly cultivate cereals along with oil seeds pulses vegetables and sugarcane commercial farming is just the opposite to subsistence farming in this case most of the produce is sold in the market for earning money in this system farmers use inputs like irrigation chemical fertilizers insecticides pesticides and high yielding varieties of seeds etc some of the major commercial crops grown in different parts of india are cotton jute sugarcane groundnut etc rice farming in harayana is mainly for commercial purpose as people of this area are pre dominantly wheat eaters howevr in east and northeastern states of india rice cultivation would be largely of subsistence type 2intensive and extensive farming the basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land in comparison with temperate areas of usa canada and former ussr india does not practise extensive cultivation when we use large patch of land for cultivation then we call it extensive farming here total production may be high due to larger area but per unit are production is low intensive farming records high production per unit of land best example of intensive cultivation is in japan where availability of land for cultivation is very limited similar kind of situation can be observed in the state of kerala in india 3plantation farming it is an estate where a single cash crop is grown for sale this type of agriculture involves growing and processing of a single cash crop purely meant for sale tea cof fee rubber banana and spices are all examples of plantation crops most of these crops were introduced in india by the britishers in the 19th century module 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 253agriculture in india social sciencenotes 4mixed farming it is a situation in which both raising crops and rearing animals are carried on simultaneously here farmers engaged in mixed farming are economically better of than others all classifications are based on nature and purpose of farming it may overlap for example banana is a plantation type of farming it can also be classified as commerical farming green revolution it stands for a major technological breakthrough in india based on i improved seeds of high yielding varieties ii adequate and assured supply of water for irrigation and iii increased and appropriate application of chemical fertilizers for increasing agricultural production white revolution it stands for remarkable increase in milk production and establishment of a national milk grid removing regional and seasonal imbalances among the technological inputs are i crossbreeding of indigenous cows with high milk yielding european breed ii pasteurization of milk for keeping it for a longer duration iii collection of quality milk from members in rural areas and iv refrigerated transport system which helps sending milk to far off metropolitan centres both by road and rail blue revolution it refers to big rise in catching of fresh water and marine fish yellow revolution it refers to remarkably steady and assured supply of poultry products pink revolution it refers to a considerable rise in the production of quantity of apples particularly in the states of himachal pradesh and jk activity 121 conduct a survey within 1

resources and development 254notes 122 salient fea tures of indian agricul ture a subsistence agricultur e as mentioned earlier most parts of india have subsistence agriculture this type of agriculture has been practised in india for several hundreds of years and still prevails in a larger part of india in spite of the large scale change in agricultural practices after independence bpressur e of population on agricultur e despite increase in urbanization and industrialization about 70 of population is still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture c mechanization of farming green revolution took place in india in the late sixties and early seventies after more than forty years of green revolution and revolution in agricultural machinery and equipments complete mechanization is still a distant dream ddependence upon monsoon since independence there has been a rapid expansion of irrigation infrastructure despite the large scale expansion only about one third of total cropped area is irrigated today as a consequence two third of cropped areas is still dependent upon monsoon as you know monsoon in india is uncertain and unreliable this has become even more unreliable due to change in climate e variety of cr ops can you guess why india has a variety of crops as mentioned in the beginning of the lesson india has diversity of topography climate and soil since india has both tropical and temperate climate crops of both the climate are found in india there are very few countries in the world that have variety comparable to that of india you would realize that when we would discuss the different type of crops in detail look at the table no1 to get an idea fpredominance of food crops since indian agriculture has to feed a large population production of food crops is the first priority of the farmers almost everywhere in the country however in recent years there has been a decline in the share of land used for food crops due to various other commercially most advantageous uses of these land g seasonal patterns india has three distinct agriculturalcropping seasons you might have heard about kharif rabi and zaid in india there are specific crops grown in these three seasons for example rice is a kharif crop whereas wheat is a rabi crop intext questions 121 1 differentiate between intensive and extensive farming by giving two points of difference eachmodule 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 255agriculture in india social sciencenotes 2 based on the salient features studied above identify the one applicable in your area example the farming is largely mechanized in harayana and well irrigated so that there is less dependance on monsoon 123 major crops of india india grows almost each and every crop can you think why if we consider the varieties of crop grown from kashmir to kanyakumari and western coast of gujarat to extreme north eastern states of arunachal pradesh there would be hundreds of crops we group all these crops into four broad types let us discuss the main crops under each type in detail table 121 sl no types of cr ops meaning major crops 1 food grains crops that are used for human consumption 2 commercial crops crops which are grown for sale either in raw form or in semiprocessed form 3 plantation crops crops which are grown on plantations covering large estates 4 horticulture sections of agriculture in which fruits and vegetables are grown 1food grains irice rice is the most important food crop of india it is predominantly a kharif or summer crop it covers about one third of total cultivated area of the country and provides food to more than half of the indian population maximum population of india is of rice consumers do you know what types of geographical conditions are required for rice cultivation if you look at rice grown areas of india you should find that this is the only crop in india which is grown in varied conditions as illustrated below some of the geographical conditions are as follows a temperatur e rice requires hot and humid conditions the temperature should be fairly high ie 24c mean monthly temperature with average temperature of 22c to 32crice wheat maize millets pulses and oil seeds cotton jute sugarcane tobacco and oilseeds tea cof fee coconut and rubber fruits and vegetablessocial sciencemodule 2

india social sciencenotes d labour rice cultivation requires easily available cheap labour because most of the activities associated with it are labour orientated and are not very well suited for mechanization edistribution rice is grown in almost all the states of india the main rice producing states are tamilnadu west bengal andhra pradesh bihar jharkhand uttara khand chhatisgarh punjab o disha uttar pradesh karnataka assam and maharashtra it is also grown in haryana m adhya pradesh kerala gujrat and kashmir valley see figure 121 ii wheat w heat is the second most important food crop of india next to rice it is a rabi or winter crop it is sown in the beginning of winter and harvested in the beginning of summer normally in north india the sowing of wheat begins in the month of octobernovember and harvesting is done in the month of marchapril this is the staple food of millions of people particularly in the northern and northwestern regions of india unlike rice wheat is grown mostly as a rabi or winter crop some of the geographical conditions are as follows a temperatur e it is primarily a crop of midlatitude grassland it requires cool climate the ideal temperature is between 10c to 15c at the time of sowing and 21c to 26c at the time of ripening and harvesting b rainfall wheat thrives well in areas receiving annual rainfall of about 75cm annual rainfall of about 100cm is the upper limit for wheat cultivation as you know areas receiving more than 100cm of rainfall are suitable for rice cultivation like rice wheat can also be grown by irrigation method in areas where rainfall is less than 75cm but on the other hand frost at the time of flowering and hailstorm at the time of ripening can cause heavy damage to the wheat crop c soil although wheat can be grown in a variety of soils but well drained fertile loamy and clayey loamy soil is best suited for wheat cultivation plain areas are very well suited for wheat production d labour wheat is highly mechanized and requires less labour e distribution the main regions of wheat production in india are up punjab haryana rajasthan madhya pradesh gujratmaharashtra up punjab and haryana together produce more than 66 of the total wheat of the country see figure 122 iii millets millets are short duration warm weather crops these are coarse grain crops and are used for both food and fodder these are kharif crop thesesocial sciencemodule 2 agriculture in india india natural environ ment resources and development 258notes are sown in mayaugust and harvested in october november today millets are mostly consumed by poor people as their staple food in india lots of millet is grown and these are known by various local names some of these are jawar bajra ragi kor ra kodon kutki hraka bauti rajgira in india jawar bajra and ragi are grownon large areas but unfortunately area under these crops has drastically reduced over the years figure 122 india wheat producing areas module 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 259agriculture in india social sciencenotes some of the geographical conditions for growing these crops are as follows a temperatur e these crops are grown where the temperature is high which ranges between 27c to 32c b rainfall as mentioned earlier that millets are dry land crops therefore rainfall ranging from 50 to 100cm is ideal for their cultivation c soil millets are less sensitive to soil deficiencies they can be grown in inferior alluvial or loamy soil d distribution jawar bajra is grown both in north and south india whereas ragi is generally concentrated in the southern india jawar bajra is grown in madhya pradesh gujrat rajasthan maharastra karnataka tamil nadu andhra pradesh haryana and punjab r agi is generally concentrated in the southern india ie tamilnadu karnataka and andhra pradesh ivpulses it includes a number of crops which are mostly leguminous and provide invaluable proteins to the vegetarian population of india as they have fewer sources of proteins in comparision to those who consume meat and fish they also serve as excellent forage and grain concentrates in the cattle feed apart from that th ese leguminous crops have the capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and are normally rotated with other crops to maintain and restore soil fertility a large variety of pulses are found in india these are gram tur or ar har pigeon pea or red gram urd black gram mung green gram masur lentil kulthi horse gram matar peas etc but among these above mentioned varieties only gram and tur or arhar are more important pulses gram it is the most important of all the pulses it accounts for about 37 of the production and about 30 of the total area of pulses in india it is a rabi crop which is sown between september and november and is harvested between february and april it is either cultivated as a single crop or mixed with wheat barley linseed or mustard some of the geographical conditions are as follows a temperatur e it is grown in a wide range of climatic condition mild cool and comparatively dry climate with 20c25c temperature b rainfall 4045 cm rainfall is favourable for gram cultivation c soil it grows well on loamy soils d distribution although gram is cultivated in several parts of the country however 90 of the total production comes from five states these states are madhya pradesh uttar pradesh rajasthan haryana and maharashtrasocial sciencemodule 2 agriculture in india india natural environ ment resources and development 260notes 1in india there was a strong tradition of eating various millets as staple food but over the years majority of the population uses either rice or wheat as staple food 2as lifestyle related diseases become pandemic in nature various millets are now prescribed as an essential food to control these diseases as they contain a lot of fibers activity 122 1find out the areasstates where rice wheat and millets are staple foods in india mention the staple foods rice wheat millets in each of the following states of india states staple food rajasthan wheat bajara karnataka your state 2on an outline map of india show the states in two different shades where rice and wheat are staple foods 2commercial crops as mentioned in the beginning of the lesson commercial crops are those crops which are grown for sale either in raw form or semi processed form in this section we will learn more about selected cash crop ie sugarcane cotton and jute two beverages tea and coffee three oil seeds ie groundnut mustard and rapeseed i sugarcane can you think life without sugar in your everyday life it is almost impossible to think of life without sugar do you know sugarcane belongs to bamboo family of plants and is indigenous to india it is a kharif crop it is the main source of sugar gur and khandsari it also provides raw material for the manufacturing of alcohol bagasse the crushed cane residue has also multiple uses it is used for manufacturing of paper it is also an ef ficient substitute for petroleum products and a host of other chemical products a part of it is also used as fodder module 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 261agriculture in india social sciencenotes some of the geographical conditions for the growth of sugarcane are as follows a temperatur e it requires hot and humid climate

retain moisture but deep rich loamy soil is ideal for its growth the soil should be rich in nitrogen calcium and phosphorous but neither it should be too acidic nor alkaline flat plain and level plateau is an advantage for sugarcane cultivation because it facilitates irrigation and transportation of cane to the sugar mills sugarcane cultivation requires heavy manures and fertilizers because it exhausts the fertility of soils quickly and extensively d labour it is a labour orientated cultivation and requires cheap labour ample human hands are required at every stage ie sowing hoeing weeding irrigation cutting and carrying sugarcanes to the factories e distribution india has the largest area under sugarcane cultivation in the world and the second lar gest producer next to brazil as far as distribution of sugarcane cultivation in india is concerned there are three distinct geographical regions in the country these regions are ithe satlujganga plain from punjab to bihar containing 51 of the total area and 60 of the country s total production iithe black soil belt from maharashtra to tamil nadu along the eastern slopes of the western gahats iiicoastal andhra pradesh and krishna river valley ii cotton cotton is the most important fibre crop not only of india but also of the entire world it not only provides a raw material for cotton textile industry but also its seed is used in vanaspati oil industry the cotton seed is also used as part of fodder for milch cattle for better milk production cotton is basically a kharif crop and grown in tropical and subtropical areas some of the geographical conditions are as follows a temperatur e cotton is the crop of tropical and subtropical areas and requires uniformly high temperature varying between 21c and 30c b rainfall it grows mostly in the areas having at least 210 frost free days in a year it requires modest amount of rainfall of 50 to 100cm however cotton is successfully grown with the help of irrigation in the areas where rainfall is less than 50 cmhigh amount of rainfall in the beginning and sunny and dry weather at the time of ripening are very useful for a good crop c soil cotton cultivation is very closely related to black soils of deccan and malwa plateau however it also grows well in alluvial soils of the satlujganga plain and red and laterite soils of the peninsular regionmodule 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 263agriculture in india social sciencenotes d labour as picking of cotton has not been made mechanized till now therefore a lot of cheap and efficient labour is required at the time of picking edistribution india has the largest area under cultivation and third largest producer of cotton next only to china and the usa within the

iii oilseeds it is one of the important groups of commercial crops in india in fact india has the largest area and production of oilseeds in the world oil extracted from oilseeds not only form s an important item of our diet but also serve s as raw material for the manufacturing of hydrogenated oil s paints varnishes soaps lubricants etc oilcake the residue after the oil is extracted from the oilseeds forms an important cattle feed and manure groundnut it is the most important oilseed of india groundnut is grown both as kharif and rabi crop but 9095 of the total area is devoted to kharif crop some of the geographical conditions are as follows a temperatur e it thrives best in the tropical climate and requires 20c to 30c temperature b rainfall 5075 cm rainfall is favourable for groundnut cultivation it is highly susceptible to frost prolonged drought continuous rain and stagnant water therefore dry winter is needed at the time of ripening csoil well drained light sandy loams red yellow and black soils are well suited for its cultivation d distribution it is the most important oilseed of india and accounts for about half of the major oilseeds produced in the country india is the lar gest producer of groundnut in the world and accounts for about one third of the world s to the production andhra pradesh tamil nadu and gujarat are three main producer of groundnut in india

have heard about tea gardens of assam and darjeeling in west bengal it is being said that tea plantation in india was started by the britishers in 1923 when wild tea plants were discovered by them in the hilly and forest areas of assam tea is made from tender sprouts of tea plants by drying them at present india is the leading tea producing country in the world china and sri lanka are respectively second and third largest producers of tea some of the geographical conditions for the growth of tea are as follows a temperatur e it requires hot and wet climate the ideal temperature for the growth of tea bushes and leaf varies between 20 c to 30 c if temperature either rise s above 35 c or goes below 10 c it would be harmful for the growth of tea bushes and lea vesmodule 2 india natural environ

be well distributed throughout the year long dry spell is harmful for tea c soil tea bush grows well in well drained deep friable loam y soil however virgin forest soils rich in humus and iron content are considered to be the best soils for the tea plantation tea is a shade loving plant and grows better when planted along with shady trees figur e 125 india t ea pr oducing areasbayofbengal

bordering the brahmaputra and surma valleys west bengal is the second largest producer of tea where tea is mostly grown in the districts of darjeeling siliguri jalpaiguri and cooch bihar districts tamil nadu is the third largest producer where tea growing areas are mostly restricted to nilgiri hills ii coffee do you know from where coffee was brought to india it is the indigenous crop of ethiopia abysinia plateau from ethiopia it was taken to yemen in 1 1th century from arabia the seeds were brought by baba budan in 17th century and were raised in baba budan hills of karnataka but it was british planters who took keen interest and large coffee estates were established in the hills of western ghats some of the geographical conditions for the growth of coffee are as follows a temperatur e it requires hot and humid climate with temperature varying between 15c and 28c it is generally grown under shady trees therefore strong sun shine high temperature above 30c frost and snowfall are harmful for coffee cultivation dry weather is necessary at the time of ripening of berries b rainfall rainfall between 150 to 250 cm is favourable for coffee cultivation c soil well drained rich friable loamy soil containing good deal of humus and minerals like iron and calcium are ideal for coffee cultivation the soil must be properly manured to retain and replenish fertility and to increase productivity d labour like tea coffee cultivation also requires plenty of cheap and skilled labour for various purposes like sowing transplanting pruning plucking dying grading and

india social sciencenotes 124 major challenges f aced by indian agricul ture if we look at the challenges faced by indian agriculture we can broadly group them into two categories one category belongs to the problems that have been long standing second category of problems is new and has been emerging from the prevailing agricultural practices system changing climate and economy let us discuss the major challenges in detail 1stagnation in pr oduction of major crops production of some of the major staple food crops like rice and wheat has been stagnating for quite some time this is a situation which is worrying our agricultural scientists planners and policy makers if this trend continues there would be a huge gap between the demand of ever growing population and the production nobody wants india to go back to a situation that was prevailing in our country prior to green revolution try to find out what was the situation during pregreen revolution period 2high cost of farm inputs over the years rates of farm inputs have increased manifold farm inputs include fertilizer insecticide pesticides hyv seeds farm labour cost etc such an increase puts low and medium land holding farmers at a disadvantage 3soil exhaustion on one hand green revolution has played a positive role in reducing hunger from india on the other hand it has also led to negative consequences one of which is soil exhaustion soil exhaustion means loss of nutrients in the soil from farming the same crop over and over again this usually happens in the rain forest 4depletion of fr esh gr ound water the second major negative consequence of green revolution is depletion of fresh ground water you would remember that areas where green revolution was successful it was due to the use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation most of the irrigation in dry areas of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh was carried out by excessive use of ground water today fresh ground water situation in these states is alarming in the coming few years if this type of farming practice continues these states are going to face water famine 5adverse impact of global climatic change among various challenges global climatic change is the recent one it has been predicted that its impact on agriculture would be immense since 70 of indian population is engaged in agricultural activities you can imagine the consequences it is predicted that due to climate change temperature would increase from 2c to 3c there would be increase in sea level more intense cyclones unpredictable rainfall etc these changes would adversely af fect the production of rice and wheat specifically rise in temperature in winter would affect production of wheat in north indiasocial sciencemodule 2 agriculture in india india natural environ ment resources and development 268notes production of rice would be affected in coastal areas of india due to ingress of saline water and increase of frequency of cyclones 6impact of globalisation you can see the ef fect of globalisation on the farm sector in india all developing countries have been af fected by it the most evident ef fect is the squeeze on farmer s income and the threat to the viability of cultivation in india this is due to the rising input costs and falling output prices this reflects the combination of reduced subsidy and protection to farmers trade liberalization exposes these farmers to competition from highly subsidized production in the developed world globalisation refers to the increasingly global relationships of culture people and economic activity subsidy a subsidy is money given by government to help support a business or person liberalization liberty to establish any kind of economic activity at any time any where in the country without anticipating any kind of so called private or public restrictions 7providing food security before the introduction of green revolution in india we were not self sufficient in terms of our food grain production due to partition of india in 1947 the network of canal irrigation system cotton belt and wheat bowl meant to west pakistan which is n ow pakistan similarly the jute belt and rice bowl was awarded to east pakistan which is n ow bangladesh with the introduction of green revolution production of food grains increased substantially and india became self suf ficient however during the last one decade the total production has become stagnant on the other hand we have added another 16 to 18 million population over th is period although india has become self suf ficient in good it is yet to ensure food security which is dependent upon accessibility affordability as well nutritional value of the food available one of the biggest challenges facing india is providing food security to its population 8farmers suicide every suicide has a multipl e of causes but when you have nearly 200000 of them it makes sense to seek broad common factors within that group the suicides appear concentrated in regions of high commercialization of agriculture and very high peasant debt cash crop farmers seemed far more vulnerable to suicide than those growing food crops yet the basic underlying causes of the crisis remained untouched commercialization of the countryside along with massive decline in investment in agriculture was the beginning of the decline withdrawal of bank credit at a time of soaring input prices and the crash in farm incomes compounded the problems shifting of millions from food crop to cash crop cultivation had its own risks privatization of many resources has also compounded the problems the devastation lies in the big 5 s tates of maharashtra andhra pradesh karnataka madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh these states accounted for twothirds of all farm suicides during 200308some of the major factors responsible are indebtednessmodule 2 india natural environ ment resources and development 269agriculture in india social sciencenotes crop failure and deterioration in economic status decline in social position exorbitant charges by local money lenders for the vulnerable farmers chronic illness in the family addiction etc have made life of
