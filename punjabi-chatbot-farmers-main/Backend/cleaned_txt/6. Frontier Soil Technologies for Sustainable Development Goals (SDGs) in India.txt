production system is additionally connected to other development challenges being included to in the sdgs a healthy soil biosphere is needed to reduce the world hunger soil is a highly valuable nonrenewable resource that ts well as a key to meet the sdgs climate change mitigation cant be complete without focus on soil health many established technologies are being used by the farmers to increase the productivity of crop and soil however certain frontier technologies such as nanotechnology remote sensing precision agriculture etc are being applied in improving soil health these technologies are complementing the existing technologies in increasing the nutrient use ef ciency of the fertilizers reduce soil degradation improve soil quality and thereby reducing risks to environmental pollution the problem lies in the widespread adoption of these technologies by the farmers as they are bound to the socioeconomic constraints therefore proper actions must be taken up to encourage them to adopt these technologies without af fecting their farm income and resources keywor ds sustainable development goals sdgs soil organic carbon soc integrated nutrient management inm

not only in food production agriculture also accounts for the release of greenhouse gases according to f ao 2017 data greenhouse gas emission from sectors including agriculture forestry and sheries has nearly doubled in the past fty years which might be expected to increase 30 per cent more in the coming twenty years if no proper measures are taken up immediately although agriculture is in the prime pedestal in achieving the sdgs it also stands in the center of many daunting challenges around that requires the interplay of science business policy etc while several achievements have been made in the last three decades to reduce poverty still the biggest challenge is to eradicate extreme poverty or to reduce the world poverty by half therefore the rst and foremost sdg is termed as no

present in sedimentary rocks and volcanic soils pores and voids are the key characteristic of zeolites mainly responsible for its high cation exchange capacity molecular sieve as well as storage capture and release of nutrient molecules cations anions and water application of zeolites have many benecial ef fects on soil and ultimately crops grown in it zeolites are found to decrease urea hydrolysis in soil by adsorbing the involved urease enzymes on its surface thereby reducing its activity it traps ammonium ions in its pores such that the nitrifying bacteria are unable to reach those places thus reduces the ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching losses resulting in the increase of nitrogen fertilizer use ef ciency in soils zeolites increase the ph of acidic soils to the optimum value and improve physicochemical properties of soils zeolites are mainly ef fective in sandy or coarsetextured soils having low cation exchange capacity zeolites also specically adsorb ammonium ions from organic manures like farmyard manure compost etc as well as from ammoniumcontaining fertilizers which in turn reduces its losses to the environment contributing to reduced pollution of air and groundwater there are various products based on zeolites which are reported to act as slowrelease fertilizers releasing nutrients corresponding to the demand of growing crops like urea

into biomass during photosynthesis when we add the plant biomass into soil releases co at faster rate during 2 decomposition conversion of the plant biomass into biochar instead of adding in soil will prevent emission of photosynthetically xed co to 2 atmosphere as decomposition rate of biochar is slower than plant biomass during pyrolysis easily decomposable plant material is converted into biochar with higher stability enhances scope for carbon sequestration carbon sequestration potential of biochar depends on how long carbon is held in soil conversion of plant biomass into biochar

threedimensional crystalline minerals mainly composed of aluminosilicates with rigid structure and are abundantly present in sedimentary rocks and volcanic soils pores and voids are the key characteristic of zeolites mainly responsible for its high cation exchange capacity molecular sieve as well as storage capture and release of nutrient molecules cations anions and water application of zeolites have many benecial ef fects on soil and ultimately crops grown in it zeolites are found to decrease urea hydrolysis in soil by adsorbing the involved urease enzymes on its surface thereby reducing its activity it traps ammonium ions in its pores such that the nitrifying bacteria are unable to reach those places thus reduces the ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching losses resulting in the increase of nitrogen fertilizer use ef ciency in soils zeolites increase the ph of acidic soils to the optimum value and improve physicochemical properties of soils zeolites are mainly ef fective in sandy or coarsetextured soils having low cation exchange capacity zeolites also specically adsorb ammonium ions from organic manures like farmyard manure compost etc as well as from ammoniumcontaining fertilizers which in turn reduces its losses to the environment contributing to reduced pollution of air and groundwater there are various products based on zeolites which are reported to act as slowrelease fertilizers releasing nutrients corresponding to the demand of growing crops like urea impregnated zeolite chips surfactant modied zeolite smz zeolite phosphate rock

against microbial attack which helps in carbon sequestration field application of biochar provides several agricultural benets biochar helps to ameliorate soil acidity improves soil fertility and minimize ghg production biochar is produced by several methods lehman et al 2007 reported that addition of biochar in soil is one of the strategies to mitigate negative climate change impact as co is 2 sequestered in soils so that load of excess atmospheric co is lowered 2 down plant xes atmospheric co 2 into biomass during photosynthesis when we add the plant biomass into soil releases co at faster rate during 2 decomposition conversion of the plant biomass into biochar instead of adding in soil will prevent emission of photosynthetically xed co to 2 atmosphere as decomposition rate of biochar is slower than plant biomass during pyrolysis easily decomposable plant material is converted into biochar with higher stability enhances scope for carbon sequestration carbon sequestration potential of biochar depends on how long carbon is held in soil conversion of plant biomass into biochar increases mean residence time of carbon as compared to direct addition of plant biomass into soil lehman 2007 application of biochar along with chemical fertilizers can reduce n o 2 emissions without af fecting mineralization or nitrication processes nelissen et al 2014 reported that

shape terraces are of two types ie common or normal terraces and bench terraces common terraces consist of a ridge or bank and a channel constructed on across the slope common terraces are generally used in areas having slope less than 20 percent bench terraces are series of level or nearly level benches or steps constructed along the lines of equal contour they are recommended in land with slopes of more than 20 percent f ao 2000 recovery and stabilization of gully in severely eroded areas is important recovery of gully is done by lling it with soil mass and is recommended for small gullies it is recommended for areas having good productivity if recovery of the gully is not possible then stabilization of gully is recommended for stabilization of small gullies having small catchment area vegetation especially graminaceous forage crops can be used alternatively appropriate tree species welladapted to the particular region with rapid growth rate should be used planting of vegetation should be done in lines perpendicular to the slope of the gully in order to form small defensive barriers these defensive barriers reduce water velocity inside the gully and deposits the carried sediments which again supports the growth of fresh vegetation for larger gullies temporary or permanent structures of vegetation barriers by branches wire netting stones and logs constructed

must also undertake more research on enhancement of human resources several forms of technologies are available in the research papers but their adoption and commercialization are limited to the farmers farmers are generally aware of their soil health but due to their socioeconomic constraints they couldnt adopt these technologies in order to replenish their soil increasing nutrient deciencies and environmental pollution on the other side has troubled the farmers in several ways subsidies are the administrations favoured tool instrument to advance agricultural technology in india each technology from quality seeds to new machines is supported by high subsidies whenever structured well this can quicken adoption of the technologies and make impetuses for advancement in a nation predominated by smallholders moderate access to any capital intensive innovation needs monetary and institutional advancements however the way in which we believed is changing and keeping in mind that the old custom of harvest cutting by utilizing crop cutting examinations is as yet occurring we are also utilizing satellite imagery and other such substantial scale information gathering frameworks to know the genuine crop yield and productivity from an area the genuine need is for direct use of computerized and dif ferent advancements to increase farm productivity and address the undeniably unmistakable environmental change impacts remote sensing gis yield and soil heath monitoring etc are typical new advancements can goad development value and maintainability yet are not substitutes for

are required to promote the above stated technologies for achieving the sustainable development goals 7 conclusion agriculture is one of the backbones of unsustainable development goals in order to improve the productivity maintenance of soil health is a must as it is the foundation where the production of food will take place institutes must also undertake more research on enhancement of human resources several forms of technologies are available in the research papers but their adoption and commercialization are limited to the farmers farmers are generally aware of their soil health but due to their socioeconomic constraints they couldnt adopt these technologies in order to replenish their soil increasing nutrient deciencies and environmental pollution on the other side has troubled the farmers in several ways subsidies are the administrations favoured tool instrument to advance agricultural technology in india each technology from quality seeds to new machines is supported by high subsidies whenever structured well this can quicken adoption of the technologies and make impetuses for advancement in a nation predominated by smallholders moderate access to any capital intensive innovation needs monetary and institutional advancements however the way in which we believed is changing and keeping in mind that the old custom of harvest cutting by utilizing crop cutting examinations is as yet occurring we are also utilizing satellite imagery and other such substantial scale information gathering frameworks to know the genuine crop yield and productivity from an area the genuine need is for direct use of computerized and dif ferent advancements to increase farm productivity and address the undeniably unmistakable environmental change impacts remote sensing gis yield and soil heath monitoring etc are typical new advancements can goad development value and maintainability yet are not substitutes for human and institutional improvement the tremendous system of panchayats and fpss fair price shops ought to be tapped to embrace awareness and outreach activities so as to accomplish efciency sustenance and health advantages inadequate connectivity in rural places high costs of services and absence of fundamental pc learning and education prevent fast improvement of eagribusiness generous venture is required in physical infrastructure broadband and

nairobi kenyafrontier soil technologies for sustainable development goals sdgs in india abstract land and water are two important nite natural resources which due to haphazard and unscrupulous exploitation are diminishing at a faster pace in present scenario prediction of climate change plays a key role in adverse weather monitoring to maintain the current global food and water security india consists of 24 of world land resources 4 of water resources but 16 of world population and contributes 8 of global gdp therefore due to increasing population land and water resources are under enormous pressure which emphasis on sustainable use of natural resources there is a need of inculcation of advanced technology like sensor based precision irrigation geospatial techniques and ground water exploration assessment and modelling approaches to overcome the crisis of natural resources sensor based irrigation helps in rationale of irrigation scheduling geospatial techniques in the monitoring of natural resources and exploration and modelling approaches of groundwater resources to overcome rapid depletion and contamination of ground water therefore keeping in view of recent advancement the present study was undertaken on research and t echnology status emerging opportunities in land and water management keywor ds climate change geospatial techniques remote sensing
