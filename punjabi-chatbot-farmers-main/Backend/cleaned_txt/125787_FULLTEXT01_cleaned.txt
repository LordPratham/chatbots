bharatdeep singh trondheim ivabstract punjab a modestsized state tucked away on the northwestern border of india is often known as the bread basket of i ndia huge grain surpluses pr oduced by its farmers since the green revolution helped the c ountry gain selfsufficiency in food but there is growing perception in the sense of uncertainty regarding what the future holds for the state after a spectacular growth rate during the sixties and the seventies punjabs economy has decelerated during 1990s the state wonders whether the younger generation will grow in the most affluent and developed state in the country as their parents once did will the heady days of the green revolution ever return to punjab such anxieties are not without reasons there is stagnation in agriculture which is the most dominant factor in the states economy as the result punjab pr esently is one of the slowest growing indian states the agricultural practices in the state seem to be increasingly becoming environmentally unsustainable the stellar grow th of monocultural patt ern of wheat and rice has resulted in manifestations of several a dverse effects like groundw ater exploitation soil degradation the stagnation in agriculture has al so resulted in various socioeconomic problems the primary reasons of stagnation were foun d to be over dominance of wheat and rice cropping system over investment in agricultu ral machinery over dependence on migrant labour besides some attitudina l changes in the behaviour of the farmers the major agricultural institutions of the state seemed to be lacking in extension services and clear policies about agriculture the farm size is de creasing thus making agriculture non profitable for small farmers farmers are facing problems due to lack of infrastructure facilities in agricultural setup agricultural diversification should be encourag ed to reverse the trends government should encourage industrialization and in vestment in agroprocessing i ndustries this study defines the present problem as the result of all the th ree participating actors in states agriculture farmers agricultural university and the govern ment the conviction of this study is that proper policies should be put in place to help farmers bail out of the present agricultural crises if the coordination betw een these three is established it can go a long way in turning punjabs

in the country at the end of the 1990s more than 94 percent of punjabs citizens were above the poverty line 70 percent were literate 94 per cent of the six year ol ds were enrolled in primary schools and 72 percent of the children fewer than twelve months were immunized 99 percent of households had access to safe drin king water and the aver age life expectancy was 68 years punjab development report 2004 it s remarkable development record can also be inferred from the fact that it has already ach ieved or is well on the track to achieve most of the millennium development goals accord ing to indias national human development report punjab was ranked second only to kerela in terms of the overall level of human development among the major indian states most citizens of punjab have thus already achieved the level of socio economic status that the majority of indi an citizens are unlikely to experience in their lifetime yet there is a sense of uneasiness regarding what the future holds for punjab concerned citizens of the state wonder whether the younger generation will grow up in the most affluent and developed state in the country like their parents and grandparents once did will the heady days of the green revolution ever return to punjab will the state be able to hold on to the impressive gains made on the socio econ omic front such anxi eties are not without reason the states public finances are unde r severe stress the economy has stagnated employment opportunities are shrinking and hu man development indicators are beginning to languish or even deteriorate with the advent of high yielding inputresponsiv e dwarf varieties of rice and wheat during 60s the entire agricu lture production system in punjab got revolutionized major shifts were witnessed in the cropping pattern especially in irrigated ecosyst ems where cereal based multiple cropping came into prominence relegating less productive risk prone legumes and oilseed crops to marginal lands the farmers found the rice wheat cycle most profitable consequently they abandoned other crops such as pulses mustard vegetables etc the practice resulted in depletion of organic content and plant nutrients in the soil the farmers 2are now compelled to use more and more chemi cal fertilizers and other inputs to achieve the same production level the law of diminishing returns has set in there are indications of significant changes in the natural resource ba se eg falling ground water table over large portions of the state water logging in the south western part degradatio n of soil health loss of organic carbon and deficiency of micro and secondary nutrie nts like zinc manganese iron and sulphur and severe soil erosion in the sub mountainous kandi belt in the eastern part of the state sondhi and khepar 1995 it is not only those ecologica l characteristics th at are changing but it has much wider prospective which needs to be st udied my concern is to study the prospective of agriculture including the recourses involved any discussion with regard to agriculture is incomplete without including the perspectives of ecology and economy social aspect can also not be ignored in the state of punja b the problem of stagnation in agriculture cannot be seen as independent problem it must be carefully studied to know the in terrelationship and importance of all the factors which might play a crucial role natural recourses are the wea lth supplied by nature availa ble for human use including energy soil fertility gro undwater forests etc of particular importance to this research work are the renewable resources specially land so il and groundwater renewable recourses are those that naturally regenerate to provide ne w supplies within certain time span they are renewable and are being always available but open to human modifica tion is that they may be depleted sustained or in creased through human activity examples of these kinds of resources include the organic re sources which are capable of reproducing themselves and are clearly affected by human action like soils gr oundwater etc however resources like soils can take much longer time to regain its fe rtility or original characteristics the major issues of agriculture in punjab i nvolve perceived resource degradation declining socio economic development of the farmers ag riculture is the dominan t sector in punjab about 45 percent of the gdp but over the last decade the growth in this sector has been much less than in the eighties about 70 percent of the people in punjab have agriculture as their main source of income and livelihood refer to url1 on page 110 land is an important asset to the agriculture in punjab its fertility ma kes it one of the most productive lands in the country with nearly maximum use of the agricultural land the pressure on land has already increased the grow ing population is also ad ding to the pressure 3it is of extreme importance to preserve the productivity of agricultural land because if exhausted can have grave consequences soil forms another important element of the agricultural system as its fertility determines the production levels last but not the least groundwater is of equal importance to the agricu lture and thus to the economy of the farmers of punjab various studies indicate that the gr ound water table is dropping alarmingly in the state which could bring daring re sults for the survival of the fa rmers and farming in the state it must be noted that natural resource manageme nt is reflected in land use patterns or systems but land use systems are characterised by variability in time and space and various socio economic and biophysical factors interact at di fferent levels blaik ie and brookfield 1987 reenberg 1995b in order to determine the actu al reasons of agricult ural stagnation it is essential to understand the socio economic biophysical and institutio nal factors involved in addition to these vital roles of resource utilization planning and management requires to be evaluated at the local level it is in line with these that the study attempts to explore the causes of stagnation and the relationship betwee n these elements in punjab it focuses on the role of agricultural institutions in managi ng the farmers and farming of the state the starting point is recognition that agricultu re and ecosystems ar e inherently linked composed of the same resources like land and water they are based on the same biological processes photosynthesis and biomass production agriculture is itself an ecosystem from which humans appropriate primary and secondary products and the histor y of agriculture can be seen as the increasing control of biologi cal processes for the purpose of increasing production in order to exploit the opportuni ties for harmonizing agriculture and ecosystems in future development initiatives should include three majo r components as been listed as requirements for optimum agricultural system according to fao agricultural department first component is knowledge the interactions and interdependencies between agriculture and ecosystems are numerous location specific and characteri sed by the complexity of thei r biophysical mechanisms this requires us to acquire a broade r knowledge of these interacti ons and processes then comes values in making strategic decisions for development and the use of natural resources such as water we need to be guided by criteria that attribut e the right value to food and environmental 4services above all in water systems that serve multiple purposes these values are in part but not exclusively economic the last co mponent but very important is the institutions we need an enabling environment to achieve coherence in national and state policies as well as in local natural resources management arrangements local stakeholders above all farmers and resource users and state government need to be fully engaged applying an ecosystems approach to agriculture means focusing on its optimization within its ecological surroundings ie to regard the agri cultural subsystem as a part of the wider ecosystem so the need of the hour is the integrated approach in recourse management that focuses on multiple services the 1992earth su mmit in rio de janeiro emphasized that agriculture and the environment must be syne rgistic and defined integration as looking for mutual services across the traditional division of pr oduction and environment coherence in the policies is also very important because reality is often such that at the policy level the problems and the opportu nities are not timely analysed and generalized coherence in the crosssectoral policies is essential to s upport collaboration among stakeholders policy coherence in agriculture can be made with in volvement of major stakeholders in case of agriculture government and farmers the em phasis in these kinds of policies is on environment economic upliftment and human development all the above discussed factors constitute the basis of this study upon these components are based the aims and objectives which are analysed in respect to the stat e of punjab the next section outlines the main research problem objectives and scope of the study 11 research problem punjab the granary of india has played a hist oric role in transfor ming india from a nation that was food deficient to one that is selfs ufficient the turnaround was so dramatic and achieved in a very short time that it was called a revolution the green revolution the punjab state with only 153 of geographical area of the country has been contributing major proportions of wheat and of rice of the national food reserves during the last three decades since the 1980s however the colour has been fading after attaining an explemplary growth in production punjab agriculture has reached at the crossroads from where sustaining growth 5appears to be an arduous task ma ny observers on agriculture issu es in punjab paint a picture of decay and degradation of agri cultural system most of the experts have expressed persistent concerns and focus regarding the margin of profit from ma jor crops and farm size etc the depletion of ground water degradation of soil health and soil texture deterioration of ecology and environment are other very serious ch allenges that punjab agriculture is facing punjabs agrarian economy today stands at crossroads the majority nearly 80 of the cultivators and all the agricultural labourers are beleaguered by sta gnation about 15 to 18 percent of the punjab farmers have already b een pushed below the poverty line joginder et al 1997 the existing cropping pattern and cr optechnology offer no solution to these problems this has lead to stagnation in agriculture the only source of income for the people of the state this challenge which agriculture faces today is also bound to have social effects in fact punjab agriculture has reached a stage where its viability and sustainability is in doubt being mainly an agricultural economy the result of stagnation has led to overall slowdown in the development of the state after a spectacular growth rate during the sixties and the seventies the punjab economy began to slow down in the late 1980s and decelerated further during the 1990s its per ca pita income grew at an annua l average rate of 21 percent during the1990s significantly below the national average and the third lowest growth rate among the major indian states much of the gr owth slowdown originated from the agricultural sector its output grew at a tr end rate of 26 percent per annum in 1990s compared to the all indian average of 32 percent and almost half of the growth rate of 5 percent per annum in the 1980s punjab statistical report 1999 thus the punjab farm economy has reached at a stage rendering the fate of large agri cultural population in doldrums the green revolution led to dramatic increas es in agricultural pr oduction and radically transformed the course of indi an agriculture nowhere was this truer than in the state of punjab where the new high yieldi ng varieties hyvs of wheat and rice were first and most intensively adopted from 1965 to 1973 production of wheat the primary winter rabi crop increased at an annual rate in excess of 7 percent rice which was not widely grown prior to the green revolution gr ew at a remarkable rate of 18 pe rcent during this period overall agricultural production increased at a rate of 6 percen t joginder et al 1997 6this record growth in production has led many ec onomists to believe that productivity growth must have also been high in punjabs agricultu ral sector more recently in the years following the green revolution there has been growing concern that hi gh rates of productivity growth have been sustained in the light of heavy wate r and fertilizer inputs dimishing growth in yields of the major crops and degradati on of the water and land resource base owing to near stagnation in yield the per hectare return on land in wheat continues to decline the per annum trend growth rate of return fr om wheat and paddy togeth er over variable cost declined from 290 percent during 1980s to 218 percent during 1990s clearly there was 508 percent less growth of re turn from wheat and paddy duri ng 1990s compared to 1980s joginder et al 1997 the everdecreasing size of net sown area pe r agricultural worker f rom 22 hectares in 1960 61 to 11 hectares in 199798 has further aggravated the problems of punjab agriculture and farmers in particular and that of punjab economy in general th is characteristic among others have resulted in grave economic fallouts for the farmers in fact punjab agriculture has reached a stage where its viability and sustainability is in doubt the ecological and economic problems related to agriculture are numerous but it appears that the greatest concerns today are the issues of cropping pattern and resource degradation which manifest it in various forms and with varied and complex results leading to social implications also all these problems relate to unsustainabl e utilisation of agricultural resources and also indicate that there is either absence or lack of co ordi nation of government development plans in the agricultural sector agricultural stagnation has lately become frequently used word in agricultural institutions and policy makers often farmers are blamed fo r causing ecological damage for practising unsustainable methods or activities many appr oaches have ensured an effort to study the environmental loss and the economic effects or social effects independent from each other the need to study the functioning of agricultura l system while keeping farmers and farming together ecological sustainability problems and opportunities are therefore important for this research work many questions needed to be a ddressed for instance despite the use of high yielding varieties and modern implements good fe rtilizers why is agriculture said to be stagnating if the stagnation in agriculture is affecting socio economic network what are the effects what role is played by the institutiona l policies to promote sustainable utilization and 7conservation of natural resources this resear ch work attempts to shed some light on the above mentioned questions and issues this study will also examin e the role of the agricultural institutions of the state so as to access the agricultural policies and management of produce these mechanisms are bound to have considerable effect on the both farmers and farming and might give an answ er to certain environmental pr oblems or specific land use patterns in addition study will also attempt to give new recommendations or guidelines after assessing the research conducted future perspec tives for the farmers will also be explored 12 research aims and objectives the main objective of the study is to look into the reason of agri cultural stagnation within the framework of environmen tal and social perspectives it will be studied by the help of certain environmental and economic parameters the research will be done by studying the institutional mechanisms at the state level analysing the presen t resource use and the changes which result from certain agricultural activities of the farmers also these causes will be determined by studying the inst itutional mechanism operating in the agricultural community and the present resources for agricultural use the study focuses on these specific subs objectives to examine the changing trends in terms of ecology and economy of ag riculture in the state in correspondence to the pre a nd post green revolution period to examine the role of major institutions in regard to the agricultural practices and patterns in the state to suggest ways to counter the present trend in agriculture and hen ce improve the situation of farmers and farming in the state 13 research justification the look into the reasons which l ead to agricultu ral stagnation are crucia l in order to address the problem adequately this assumes even mo re significance in view of importance of agriculture to the economy and farmers of the state the importance of vibrant agriculture has been clearly discussed in punjabs economic policies and other supporting documents and plans 8the need to study the functioning of agriculture and resource management with their impact on ecological sustainability and economic opportuniti es are therefore of paramount interest in both academic and policy circles the study of fa rmers involvement and role in sustainable recourse utilization is also crucial in determin ing specific land use prac tices that carry special implications for vital resources such as thos e in agriculture much has been written on the slow agricultural growth and termed it as sta gnation but little information was available on the possible reasons in specific socio economic settings recent works on this area are found in annual growth reports agricultural procurement statistics of the stat e this study therefore attempts to present an insight view of the present agriculture prac tices handling the causes and effects of stagnation in agriculture through fieldwork carried among the local farmers of the state some attempts are being made by some government institutions to help the farmers to pull them out of this stagnating profession this st udy also seeks to examine to what extend farmers are responding to such programmes and wh at are their views about the efforts also to study that if the designed programmes are not working for farmers then what are the reasons this study will also tr y to shed some light on the issue of social aspect by finding out if the agricultural slowdown ha s any relation with the social be haviour of the farmers it is expected that useful information comments and suggestions from the study will go a long way in shedding some light on punjabs agricu ltural problems by focussing on the interactive relation between farmers and their recourses the support of all the elements concerned in this study will be crucial to address the research objective adequately this study hopes to find the linkages between the integrated factors between farmers and farming in the state of punjab 14 organisation of the study the study is divisible into three parts the firs t segment focuses on the concepts theories and perspectives in social science associated with the study underta ken it also highlights on the methods adopted to collect and process data the second part looks at the key changes in agricultural pattern in the stat e especially on the agricultural prospects in the pre and post green revolution period 9then it also includes the possible reasons identi fied for the stagnation the third and the final section deals with the role of institution re lated to the field and possible recommendation s from the study the final report is organised in to eight chapters the first chapter has presented the general introduction and background to th e study research problem and goals of the study research setting including the characteristi cs of study area forms the sec ond chapter literature on the main theoretical prospective resource manage ment approaches and other relevant regimes are discussed in chapter three this chapte r ends with a presentation of a conceptual framework within which the st udy is analysed the research approach sample selection process and data collection methods are issues discussed in chapter four chapter five discusses the changes in the agricultural scen e over a period of time in agriculture the possible results meeting the goals of the study are presented in chapter six chapter deals with the study of major agricultural institution sin the state major issues are summed up in chapter eight including recommendations for action and further research 10chapter two the research setting 20 introduction the word punjab is made up of two persian wo rds punj means five and aab means water this name was given to this land due to presence of five rivers within its territory prior to independence of india in 1947 punjab extended across both sides of what now is india pakistan border with lahore its capital but af ter independence punjab was again divided into two parts one going to pakistan and the other half staying with india chandigarh the first planned city of india was build and it becam e indian punjabs capital in 1966 punjab was again bifurcated into two states predominantly punjabi speaking state of punjab and hindi speaking state of haryana refer to url 2 on page 110 however due to the partition of the state during the indepe ndence of india and creation of pakistan in 1947 presently only three rivers remain in punja b presently punjab is one of the smallest states of india with an area of 50362 sqkm 2 which constitutes about 153 percent of the total geographical area of the country it is located between 29 and 32n latitude and 74 and 17 longitude refer to url 3 on page 110 according to indi an census 2001 this modest sized state tucked away on the northwestern border of the country has a population of 25 million the state is divided into 17 distri cts with its capital in chandiga rh physically the state may be divided into two parts sub shiv alik strip and sutlej ghagge r plain punjab has an uncommon prominence in india for more than four deca des now it has remained the most prosperous state in the country with lowest rates of poverty punjab devel opment report 2004 its turbulent history including redrawing of its bor ders at the time of independence in 1947 huge grain surpluses produced by its farmers since th e green revolution which helped the country gain self sufficiency in food its location as a frontline state on an often hostile border it has contributed positively in the development of the country location of punjab state which lies in the north western part of india as shown in the map below 11 map of punjab within india source wwwmapsofindiacom as seen the location of punjab within india punjab is sharing inte rnational borders with pakistan on its west with jammu and kashmir in its north himachal pradesh in its east haryana and rajasthan in its south the capital of the state chand igarh is about 300 kilometres north to new delhi the capital of india majority of the states population lives in vi llages and agriculture is the most important activity of the state agricultural land is the states most important natural endowment the 12punjabs prosperity has been largely due to th e states development of agriculture there are some major factors that have led to the punj abs highly productive agricultural system one factor is its fertile soil punjab is for the most part a large flat plain of fertile alluvial soil other factors include extensive irrigation works suitable climate hardworking farmers and above all the advent of green revolution punjab is divided into 17 administrative dist ricts with 143 towns and 12413 villages further more it has 72 tehsils a dist rict is divided into smalle r areas called tehsils and 140 development blocks the major economic activit ies apart from agriculture are industries which are located in cities but mainly in central city of ludhiana southern district of patiala and the northern district of amritsar population of the state is rural dominated which accounts for 1604 million 6605 while urban population accounting for 824 million 3395 with this population the density is 482 persons per sq km the overa ll literacy rate in the state at pr esent is 6995 which constitutes 752 percent male literacy and 634 per cent is precisely the female literacy rate in the state india census 2001 in terms of connectivity the state capital chan digarh has excellent ai r services linking with new delhi amritsar airport is an internati onal airport making an important link between the state and rest of the world by air from delh i one can reach any city in punjab within two hours other well connected airports are situat ed at chandigarh amritsar ludhiana ludhiana district boasts of having an inland cont ainer depot which serves to major industrial requirements all major towns and district he adquarters have excellent rail links for both passenger and goods traffic chandigarh ludhian a amritsar ferozepur and jalandhar

district is one of the biggest districts in the state both area and population wise and is located at 3055 n and 7554 e the third district mansa is situated in the southern part of the state with an area of 2174 sq km this district shares its borders with the neighbouring state of haryana and is generally considered to be the isolated district of the state partly due to its cornered position refer to url 4 on page 110 15 212 relief and drainage from the geographical and physiographic point of view punjab falls into two regions the shivaliks and the plain the shivalik region covers the outer range of the shivalik hills which is approximately 6 to10 kms in width their height ranges between 400 and 700 metres above sea level it consists of conglomerates clay s and siltsall having the character of fluviatile deposits of rivers and stream the low range of the shivalik hills separates the himalayas from the plains the shivalik region covers th e eastern most areas of ropar hoshiarpur and gurdaspur districts the punjab plain is a part of the great indoga ngetic plain which is a synclinal basin formed by the elevation of the himalayas the punj ab plain lies between 180 and 300 meters above sea level it is higher near the shivalik hill s but slopes away from them the tract covering central punjab ranges between 230 and 270 metres above sea level while western bhatinda and ferozepur districts lie below 230 metres a bove sea level the land slopes from east to west the gradient is much more in the east than in the west but generally except for the strip of the shivalik hills along the st ates eastern border the entire area is a flat alluvial plain with elevation ranging between 180 and 300 meters above sea level the hosiarpur district is situ ated on the foothills of himalayas so it has gently undulating terrain becoming mountainous towards the eastern border the di strict of ludhiana is almost plain in terrain and is very fortunate to have s utluj which is one of the major rivers passing through the state mansa district is charact erized by semi sandy soil but more or less the district has plain terr ain except for few sand dune areas as mentioned earlier the state of punjab is fortunate to have three rivers namely ravi beas sutluj and the seasonal river ghagger river ravi touches the northern most part of the state partly passing through the districts of amritsar beas river enters punj ab through its western border and joins river sutluj which passes through the middle of the state this pattern of rivers divides the state into three cultural zones namely majha doaba and malwa the state has majority of its land under the ganga plains region which is one of th e most fertile lands in the country and has been formed by the slow deposition of alluvi al sediments from the rivers over long time 16213 vegetation climate and soil there are three well defined seasons in the punjab these are hot season midapril to the end of june rainy season ear ly july to the end of septem ber and cold season early december to the end of february the transi tional seasons are postmonsoon september to end of november this is the most welcome season and the agricultural year starts with its advent monsoon winds reach the region normally in the first weeks of july the bay of bengal branch of the monsoon curren t is the main source of rainfa ll it is transitional period between the rainy and cold seasons prehot season march to midapril it is a transitional period between the cold and hot seasons the subtropical latitudinal and continental location of punjab makes the variation of temperat ure from month to month very high though the minimum air temperature rarely drops below 0 o c ground frost is a common phenomenon in mid winter the rise in temperature is gradua l when the air has high moisture content with the sky remaining overcast the rise is however st eep when the sky is clear and there is little moisture content in the air but generally the climate of punjab is typical ly subtropical with hot summers temperatures reaching as high as 47c in ce rtain areas and cold winters l owest temperatures touching up to 2cthe annual rainfall is around 462 mm in plains and 890 mm in the northern submontane regions characterised by the lower shivaliks about 70 percent of the annual rainfall is received during monsoon months june to august and a part of it is received during winters january psc st 1995 during the winter se ason weather in punjab is normally cool and dry this t ype of weather is associated with the passage of western disturbances through the region the importance of winter rainfall in punjab is immense primarily because of its time and effectiveness in the area adjoining the shivalik hills winter crops are dependent upon this rainfall the subsh ivalik region receives more than 100 mm of rainfall from december to march in punjab the soil characteristics are influen ced to a very limited extent by the topography vegetation and parent rock th e variation in soil profile characteristics are much more pronounced because of the regional climatic differences punjab can be divided into three distinct regions on th e basis of soil types 171 southwestern punjab this region covers the tehsils of fazilka muktsar bhatinda mansa and parts of ferozepur which border haryana and rajasthan states in the southwest the soil is predominantly calcareous developed under hot and arid to semiarid conditi ons the ph value ranges from 78 to 85 which shows that the soil is normal in reaction grey and red desert calsisol regosol and alluvial soils are found in this zone this soil zone with less moisture content is ideal for cotton crop mansa which is one of the study districts has been traditionally known for good cotton production 2 central punjab the soil of this zone has developed under se miarid condition the soil is sandy loam to clayey with normal reaction ph from 78 to 85 the soil covers the districts of sangrur patiala ludhiana jalandhar kapurthala and amristar parts of gurdaspur ferozepur and fringes of kharar tehsil of r opar district this clayey soil ty pe has characteristics of holding water and moisture which makes it fit for rice cu ltivation ludhiana district was selected from this soil zone as a representative district 3 eastern punjab the soil has developed in the subhumid foot hill areas bordering himachal pradesh covering eastern parts of gurdaspur hoshiarpur ropar a nd northeastern fringes of patiala district because of the undulating topography and fair am ount of rainfall normal erosion is quite common the fertility of the soil is medium to low and the texture is loamy to clayey district hosiarpur was selected from this third region of soil types so in a way punjab is very fortunate to have good soils which result into exceptional agricultural capability in terms of production 214 land utilization being primarily an agricultural state majority of the land is devoted to agriculture although the land under agriculture has not changed much since 1970 s but there has been some difference in the utilization of th e land it can be seen in th e table 2 below which shows the land utilization in punjab with two time series 18 table 2 land utilization in punjab 000 ha 186 140 cropping intensity 7941 5678 cropped area4268 4053 net area sown 26 139 fallow land14 92 culturable land 409 416 nonagricultural use45 208 unculturable and barren land281 123 area under forests5033 5033 geographical area200102 197071 item source singh et al 1997 as in the table 2 above shows the land division in the state it can be noted that the barren land in the state is almost negligible and th e fallow land has also reduced drastically net sown area is almost stagnated due to the limita tion of fixed land available for agriculture non agricultural land includes urban areas and the areas which are not used for either agriculture or urban settings but basically it is used fo r expanding cities with the ever increasing population due to pressure on land cropping intens ity has also increased significantly during the last three decades interestingly area under forests has increased because of various forestry schemes which were launched intensiv ely by the government it should be noted that the cultivable land which is not ye t utilized is not much left re sulting in the state with limited opportunity to increase the area und er agriculture horizontally 22 socio economic activities it is the rich tradition that has made this part of india a laboratory of the process of economic social and cultural transformation through the pa rticipation of the people in building their own destiny punjabis are fortunate to have a long cultural history the typical punjabi is an extrovert a sociable fellow wh o likes to eat well and dress well punjabis are known for their ability to learn quickly and assimilate new cultures wit hout difficulty family honour is of great importance to punjabis bu t generally punjabis tends to be liberal minded it is a matter 19of pride for punjabis to be up to date th ere enterprise and capacity to work hard are legendary and their deepest ambition is to be there own boss the social bonds are normally strong between fa milies the major social activities include marriages and festivals which are celebrated w ith great fervour marriages hold important place in the family traditions and are genera lly celebrated on a grand scale an average punjabi spends considerable amount of m oney in organising marriage ceremonies which include catering to large gatheri ngs and often expensive dowries in case of girl marriage the rich lifestyle is exhibited in all forms in punjab i culture whether it is functions or festivals punjabi society is marked with some discrimina tions also particularly consistently low and declining sex ratio the gender ra tio is only 874 which is one of the lowest in india punjab development report 2004 the high costs of dow ry involved in girl marriages are one of the reasons which lead to sex sele ctive abortions in the state when it comes to economic activities apart from agriculture industries contribute in providing employment and income for the industrial development of an area infrastructure plays a significant role the rapid industriali zation depends on the ad equate ava ilability facilities like road railways power water and developed transport and communication network financing and admini strative support from centralstate govt etcexcept for some major cities industries are not very wide spread in the state due to non availability of any kind of raw material in the state particularly the districts of ludhiana patia la amritsar and jalandha r have considerable industries but rest of the st ate has negligible industrializ ation the reason for the above mentioned districts to be industrialized may be accreted due to their well connectivity with other states through national highways particular ly the ludhiana district is the hub of hosiery and called the manchester of indi a a variety of items such as cycle and cycle parts sewing machines and components automobiles part s and accessories hosie ry and knitwear goods industrial fasteners machine tools and components rubber goods woolen garments electronic goods etc are being produced in the small scale sector the industry in large and medium sector is producing items as bicycles hosiery goods tyres tubes electronic goods steel and alloy steel castings beer sugar flour ri cerice bran oil and cattle feed etc 20industries in ludhiana provide ample job opportun ities for the surrounding areas of the city large number of migrant labour is employed in these kinds of f actories within the city this migrant labour is mostly from the other economically backward states of india the nature of employment in these factories is permanent except for some like hosiery which is seasonal in nature 23 summary in this chapter general introducti on of the punjab and pa rticularly of study ar ea is presented i have presented the general physical and so cio economic character istics of the wider regional economy and the study area in particular out of the thr ee study districts ludhiana is the most industrialized whereas mansa is consider ed as one of the most backward district in the state the physical geography of the hosiar pur is different from the state due to the influence of lower himalayas but generall y the state depends upon the agriculture with majority of its population depending on it with such a massive dependence on agriculture it assumes great importance for the states economy and for its development besides the description of location and size relief dr ainage vegetation climate and soil are also discussed in respect to their relevance to the research work the next chapter continues with the literature on the major perspectives theories and approaches in relation to agriculture management in general and its relationshi p with punjabi farmers in particular 21chapter three theoretical framework 30 introduction a set of connected statements used in explan ation can be called a theory theories play crucial role in social science for generating id eas it is virtually impossible to do research without a theory the nature and status of theories diffe r among philosophies of social science with the help of theories we can analyse and synthesize various frameworks these theoretical frameworks help us to lay the f oundation for research an d practice hence in doing a study that involves rese arch it is important to c hoose appropriate concepts and theories that are capable of fully explaining the reality of the situation the theoretical and analytical framework adopt ed in this study th erefore combines an agricultural and resource mana gement approach which deals with the relationship between resources and farmers resource geography has its roots in the human and environmental tradition and is characterised by the focus on hu manenvironment relationships this chapter discuss as various dominant theoretical perspect ives relating to the ma jor factors of the study 31 perspectives on agriculture and environment management in punjab most environmental issues that have been raised at the turn of the 21 st century have been linked to several socioeconomic issues and thes e have facilitated the conceptualization of various thoughts that have permeated discussi ons held at various le vels the relationship between people and their environment is pr obably the most important core theme in geography in present times the work of fren ch human geographers vidal de la blache and lucien febvre have explained the environment society relation as one in which the physical environment offers possibiliti es for human existence and ad aptation they emphasised the role of society in taking advantage of th e possibilities presente d by its geographical environment this relationship between human kind and nature thus involves both physical nature and the mental nature of humanity and hence human values this interaction has had the effect of transforming the relationship of people and their environment through the course of history humans have been ac ting as active agents in realisi ng the possibilities presented by 22natural environment and also as potential destroye rs of that environmen t modern geographers like carl osauer have defined humans as ac tive agents affecting the nature around them different societies or social gr oups perceive and use the envir onment in different ways which can be understood by learning abou t the geographical behaviour of the people as it is this integration between the percepti on and the practice of the soci ety which leads to different dimensions of the re lation between them according to chris 1990 it has increasingly be en accepted that both the environmental and the structural views contain considerable elements of truth but are incomplete in isolation as a result attention has focused on the way structural processes interact with the environment it is of great importance to see whether this statem ent is applicable in the case of this present study to begin with we have to understand the gree n revolution period in punjab according to chris dixon the term green revolution can be attached with three distinct meanings 1 a breakthrough in plant breeding th at produced high yielding food grains 2 a package of technology including fertilizer insecticide implements water control and hyv seeds 3 an agricultural development strategy in which the applicati on of technology to third world agriculture is central to the pr oblem of increasing food production in case of punjab it was more to do with the introduction of hyv s which were introduced in india in 1965 and were the re sults of work by mexican agricultural experiments which triggered the advent of green revolution resourcesociety theme has always been concer ned about human perception and utilization of environment and resources used for certain human practices one of the main approaches to environmental damage the classical approach by blaike 1985 biot et al 1994 advocates the extend and solution to the environmental prob lem is well known but the challenge is to get people to implement it the above said a pproach emphasizes on four major elements 1 identification of an environmental pr oblem 2 subsistenceoriented production 3 mismanagement of the environment by the users and 4 over population 23to tackle these set of problems diagnosis associated with the approach includes identification of problem as serious indi cating that it needs immediate attention technical measures requiring the co operation between the communities different plans to be implemented through th e combination of encouragement persuasion and intervention of th e state institutions the above discussion sets the base for consider ing the case of punjab agriculture which is facing ecological damage including sharp d ecline in ground water table in order to understand the present situation better we need to discuss the backgr ound of the situation first by mid 1960s green revolution swept the state this revolution was a combined effort of many factors in case of punjab according to martin et al1992 pr oductivity increases in developing countries are depe ndant upon a number of factors prominent among those factors include ecological factors sp ecially degradation of intensiv ely farmed agricultural land deterioration of environmental characteristics these factors play an important role in determining the agricultural productivity in terms of production and incomes another factor is the institutional factor wh ich includes human resource developments the social organisation of agricu lture and the efficiency of government and participant ant organisations these organisations play an importa nt role in determining the future trends in agriculture and are responsible for formula tion of policies which have direct impact on farmers and farming last but not the least economic factors also play an important part in increasing agricultural efficiency these factors include profit incentives to farmers fixing prices of agricultural produce and marketed outputs the setting up of minimum support price is an important step towards giving some kind of assurity by the gove rnment that the produce of the framers will be bought at a certain fixed price it discourages the exploitati on of farmers by other private procurement agencies these were principally the factor s on which punjabs success was based but as the time went on the state started witnessing st agnation in the yields of majo r crops accompanied by severe environmental problems associated with the dominant crops 24martin argues that the projecti ons based on the extrapolation of historic trends aim tend to show the longer term impacts of these factors these factors will definitely tend to shift the characteristics in positive or ne gative direction when they are allowed to continue on longer terms for instance he says that if economic incentives are increased fo r the agriculture then it will result in result in better economic support for farmers but in contrary to this statement mellor et al 1985 argues that if agricultural produce is cheap then it will generate more income within people rather than giving more incentives to farmers and making the produce expensive in the market he says that lower f ood prices to consumers generate more economic development than higher agri cultural prices to farmers these lines of argument are incompatible with each other it has to be seen that in case of punjab agriculture what kind of impact the incentives has on farmers income this will be seen after the results of the present study that if farmers are using those incentives to generate more income or in which channel are they investing there income there are certain sources and issues which are responsible for sustained production growth major among are the economic climate for growth it is important to situate the projected trends in a discussion of the underlying sources of growth and of the constraints within the agricultural sector governments in developing countries like indi a face important competing uses for scarce budget recourses the agricultura l budget finds its utilization in financial costs of producer price supports and subsidies for inputs specially fert ilizers and cheap credit facilities because at the same time the funds have to be dive rted for many other purpo ses like new technology innovation infrastructure like roads etc similar requirements are there for social investment area and yields agricultural area is an important character for increasing growth in production there is potentially no scope of expansion in agricultural area in the state of punjab even in contrast the agricultural land can decline in coming years due to rapid urbanization and increasing population yields ar e based on the resear ch activity which is normally carried out in the agricultural institutions so for this purpose the role of institutions become very important for the f unctioning of agricultural system 25but despite meeting all the above factors th ere are some ecological threats to continued production growth according to martin there is increasing concern about the sustainability of agricultural production this comes partly from environmen tal degradation of currently relatively high yielding land there can also be concerns about diseases pests and genetic adaptability punjab is the area most closely identified with the gains of the gree n revolution within punjab itself ludhiana district was seen as th e spearhead of an indian agricultural revolution1 and also a model for third world ag ricultural development in general1 my aim is to study the agriculture stagnation in punjab in a broader prospect farming can not be studied without integrati ng it with the farmers this study emphasis and analysis the role of farmers farming institutions together in order to study the causes and effects of stagnation in agriculture according to peggy f barlett 1980 there is increasing complexity of development problems and proposed solutions agricultur al development involves change in two dimensions the kinds of crops grown and th e way they are grown in both dimension agronomic behaviours ramify into the entire so cial and political orga nization of rural life planned agricultural developm ent projects also involve th e introduction of new crops as farmers are urged to try diversification in ag riculture whereas many communities grow same crops they had grown over centuries other ch ange their production deci sions in response to national price market politics and to changi ng infrastructure turning to second major dimension of agricultural developm ent decisions on agricultural t echniques give rise to some of the same issues in many areas of the world development projects have not introduced new crops but have instead tried to increase th e productivity of traditional crops the most common single change is the introduction of chemical fertilizers insecticides machinery and irrigation it is important to understand the farmers perception and behaviour towards agriculture c gladwin 1980 discusses a theory of real life decisions in which she explores that decisions taken by farmers are often based on attentive and preattentive modes this 1 see appendix i 26distinction explains some aspe cts of current decisions and al so suggests how past decisions are integrated into behaviours and choice pattern s she says that the cropping decision to be taken by the farmer actually depends upon the many factors these factors range from demand of the crop to the soils water requirements knowledge time labour and credit often arranged in a format of decision tree she also talks about the diversification decision for the framer where a farmer tends to di versify to other crops if he finds it more profitable and less risky it much depends upon the value of the cr op to which the farmer wants to diversify if the value and the risk of the new crop is more then the farmer can still tend to go for it but if the value of both crops more or less are equal th ere is no reason for the farmer to take the risk of the riskier crop this would be the case between rice and sugarcane when the farmer thinks they have a bout equal returns 32 structuration theory the british sociologist anthony giddens is credite d with structuration theory which explains the integration between agency and structure for giddens human agency and social structure are not two separate concepts or constructs but are two ways of considering social action there is a duality of structures so that on one side it is composed of situated actors who undertake social action a nd interaction and their knowledge activities in va rious situations at the same time it is also the rules resources and interaction and social relationships that are produced and reproduced in soci al interaction giddens defi nes structuration as the structuring of social relations across time and space in virtue of duality of structure giddens 1990 structuration attempts to understand a partic ular environment and how people tend to use their resources to enhance their lives gidde ns makes this point by saying that the basic domain of study of the social sciences according to the theory of structuration is neither the experience of individual actor nor the existence of any form of social totality but social practises ordered across space and time giddens distinguishes the systems and structures according to him systems are patterns of rela tions in grouping of all kinds from small intimate groups to social networks to large organizations that is it is the patterns of enacted conduct the repeated forms of social action and interaction or the enduring cycles of reproduced relations that form social systems 27 for giddens structure is somewhat more specific and detailed and refers to practices which are structured along certain lines these are i procedural rules about how the practice is performed for eg in the case of punjab government procures produce from farmers so the farmers are dependent on government system and naturally they will grow only that crops which will be bought by government in this case rice and wheat ii moral rules about appropria te forms of enactments of so cial action laws what is permissible and what is not ie appropriate ways of carrying out social action and interaction ie farmers action of early rice transplantation rather than waiting for the prescribed time which damages ecological balance by using more underground water rather than rain water iii material resources about allocation of res ources among activities and members of society commodities ie loans from cooperative banks grameen banks which give money on very less interest iv resources of authority on formal organizations how time and space are organized the efforts which are done by orga nization s like punjab agricu ltural university kisan unions play an important role in creating awareness structures such as market exchange class stru ctures political organizations and processes and educational institutions all have these aspect s to them it is enacted human conduct in the form of structured practices that maintains and reproduces these structures but if these enacted forms of conduct change either beca use individuals make conscious decisions to change or through less conscious forms of adju stment adaptation and practice then this can result in structural change as well social move ments collective action or parallel changes by many individuals could have this result giddens suggests human agency and social stru cture are in a relations hip with each other and it is the repetition of the acts of individua l agents which reproduces the structure this means that there are social structuretraditions institutions moral codes and established ways of doing things but it is also means that these can be change d when people start to ignore them replace them or reproduce them differently 28so peoples everyday actions rein force and reproduce a set of expectationsand it is this set of other peoples expectations which make up the social forces and social structures as giddens puts it society only has form and that form only has effects on people so far as structure is produced and reproduced in what people do giddens and pierson 1998 there are some specific practices which are adopted by the farmers but it has to been seen that if farmers themselves are aware of the consequences of their policies this type of monitoring by the farmers themselves is called reflective m onitoring by giddensit is this reflective ability that permits individuals to account for expl ain and rationalize their actions giddens had identified this kind of motivation as the result of conscious or unconsciou s efforts in the case of punjab agricultural practices it will be interesting to know that these practices are conscious or unconscious these practices incl ude burning of paddy straw and the decline in ground water due to certain agricultural practi ces adopted by the farmers he talks about agency influences the structure and also a bout the timing of influe nce which could result changes the type of in fluence giddens 1979 in the case of punjab the government is pushing fo r allout industrial growth and this is true in the agricultural sector as much as a ny other the emphasis is on new agribusiness enterprises such as sugar pr oduction but these are just as intensive as green revolution agriculture experts from punjab agricultural university have been long been saying that building more sugar mills in punjab is a bad idea considering that the state is faced with severe groundwater problems nor is its soil suitable for growi ng sugar cane such enterprises are more political than agricultural and they are gravely detrimental so we can see that by adopting these steps state government is creating structures for the pe ople to fit in but it is to be decided by people if they want to adjust in the structure or device an alternative system human ecology focuses on human adjustments to the physical environm ent the original concept presented by harlon barrows in 1923 referre d it to as the science of human ecology although bryant and bailey 1997 defined this con cept as the integrated physical and social scientific understanding of humanenvironment interaction they give importance to the interaction between man and environment th rough use of political and socio cultural structures human ecology percei ves resource managers to in tegrate the environment with economic and social understanding in the proc ess of policy making as well as evaluation of systems peet and thrift 1989 local practices re flect peoples perception and adjustment of 29the environment to which the knowledge and cust oms have direct influence it is therefore important to know the strategies of the local people relating to human use of environmental resources 33 sustainable development the term was first used in 1980 in the world co nservation strategy it is development which achieves ecological sustaina bility while striving to meet soci etys other needs relating to the topic this can be used regarding efficient use of natural resources during agricultur al practices according to repetto 1986 sustainable de velopment is a development strategy that manages all assets natural recourses and human recourses as well as financial and physical assets for increasing long term wealth and we ll being the goal of achieving a sustainable planet one that will accommodate the basic n eeds of its present inha bitants while preserving the resources that will enable future generati ons to flourish has gained increasing acceptance according to our common future b rundtland commission 1987 refer to url5 on page 110 sustainable development is that development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future genera tions to meet their own demands the word sustain from the latin sustinere sus from below and tenere to hold to keep in existence or maintain implies longterm support or pe rmanence as it pertains to agriculture sustainable describes farming systems that are capable of maintaining their productivity and usefulness to society indefinitely such syst ems must be resource conserving socially supportive commercially competitive and envi ronmentally sound when we talk about the concept of sustainable agriculture we can c onclude that it should cover and satisfy human food requirements enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends make the mo st efficient use of nonrenewable resources and onfarm resources it should also sustain the economic viability of farm operations and most importantly enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole the notion of sustainability ha s roots in utilitarian resour ce management the concept of sustained yield such as ground water the level of extraction that could be maintained without lessening future levels much of the environmen tal degradation is associated with the green revolution technology adopted to increase crop output bina agarwal 1981 although dramatically successful in the later objective in the short run it has had high environmental costs in the long run such as falling water ta bles due to tubewells water logging declining 30soil fertility with excessive chem ical fertilizer use etc moreove r the long term sustainability of the output increases achieved so far itself appears doubtful present day agriculture has many characteristics rapid technological innovation large capital investments in order to apply production an d management technology largescale farms single cropsrow crops grown continuously over many seasons uniform highyield hybrid crops extensive use of pestic ides fertilizers and extern al energy inputs high labour efficiency and dependency on agribusiness when we talk about sustainable agriculture we can have different views by different people invo lved in the field the agricultural scientists look at the term as a way of consolidating food production and ensuring food sufficiency for the masses their main aim is how to make agri culture production more reliable in terms of quantity and quality when it comes to environmentali sts they refer this term as an important way to more responsible attitude towards enviro nment they are concerned with the ways and techniques that are adapted in farming practices they analyse the effects of particular crops and cropping pattern on the environment conserva tion of natural resources within the field of agriculture is their main objective similarly for the economists the concept of sustainable development means the appropriate use of our natural resources which are often scarce in such a way that they benefit our present generati on but not at the cost of our future generation it emphasises on economic use of the resources in order to gain sustainable development in the field of agriculture whereas the sociologists see sustainable agriculture as the reflection of social values and path constant with tra tiditional values cultures and institutions they view traditional values and pr actices as perfect methods for sustainable agriculture they often give importance to local and indigenous knowledge and the methods evolved by local people but even though every group has different views about this term but at least they all agree that there is definitely mo re importance attached to the su stainability of agriculture in present times the agro ecology is defined as the application of ecological concepts and principles to the design and management of sustainable agro eco systems an ecosystem framework is shown to be essential for determining 1 if a partic ular agricultural practice input or management decision contributes to or detr acts from sustainability and 2 the ecological basis for the functioning of the chosen management strategy over the longterm such an orientation is essential for developing alternat ives that reduce purchased external inputs lessen the impacts of such inputs when they are used and establ ish a basis for designing systems that help 31farmers sustain their farms and their farming communities we can first outline the reasons why an agro ecological approach to agriculture is needed as well as defining and describing both agro ecology and sustainable agriculture with a primary focus on crop plants the second focus would be on the in teraction between the indivi dual crop organism and the environment building an autecological fram ework for understanding how factors of the environment function and can be managed th irdly we should examine the system level interactions stressing the need for understand ing thee ecosystems that are of value in sustainable agriculture then we can propose a framework for setting the parameters for sustainability which outlines the indicators that can best inform us if we are moving in the necessary directions and explains how to broade n the agenda of sustainability to include the whole food system humans and human society must be integrated with the ecological knowledge of agro ecosystem sustainability bri nging us back to the un derstanding that agro ecosystems are after all the co evolution between a culture and its environment in this balance lies true sustainability since the time of green revolution we have b een experiencing some drastic changes in the farming techniques as well as in the use of inputs post green revolution period has seen less traditional values being actually applied in the fields these changes range from the use of less green manure and higher use of synthetic fertiliz ers the increasing prevalence of ricewheat combination instead of traditional mixed patte rn of cropping some of these changes among others have led to a distinct change in the pr e and post green revolution periods especially in regard to the environmental changes in agricult ure it has been established beyond doubt that for the success of agriculture there should be a sustainable use of natural and man made resources using human skills and labour we can sa y that in order to sustain our resources we should try to establish a particular agricu lture production system involving the local community and farmers which optimiumly utilizes both the internal and external resources in agriculture the internal resources are the resources which are inherently renewable and thus have the potential to be used on the su stained basis like rainfall soil nutrients biological pest control and green manure biological fi xed nutrition family labour wh ereas the external resources are classified as the resources which are obtai ned from outside the community these mostly include nonrenewable resources like water from deep wells artificial fertilizers and insecticides hybrid seeds and hi red labour the use of these inte rnal and external resources 32plays an important role in determining the sust ainability of the agricu lture system and also they have the ability to affect the socio economic structure of the society sustainability refers to whether a system is meant for long term use for present and future generation to maintain some activity is the f ace of stress and to maintain the ability to produce the sustainable system may have a shock which might come in form of sudden increase in the inputs particular ly external resources these shoc ks particularly external may lead to collapse of the system altogether the major resource inputs in agriculture ar e labour land and capital which are used for investment in fertilizers diesel pesticid es and agricultural machinery examples of agriculture technology that has hi gh potential sustainability are crop rotation green manuring and zero tillage integrated pest management if the agro ecosystem is defined so as to include both ecological and socioeconomic components then we can envisage a hierchy of such a system on the pattern of the hierchy of agro ecosystems devised by gordon r conway below is a figure 1 which depicts the systematic chain of steps leadi ng to a particular situation in a particular agriculture system source authors own construct sustaianble or unsustainable agro ecosystem resource use specific land use practicesnature of agragarian society renewable resources non renewable resources cropping system resourse managementskills of the society awareness level 33logical framework approach lfa can be applie d to explain the structure where we find out the causes of a particular situation and their eff ects in the above figure in order to understand the conditions of punjab agriculture we consid er three main pillars leading to the present situation these are firstly we consider the use of resources thes e can be of two types as discussed earlier internal or external both of these variants can have effect on the long term use of resources the major resources which are expected to play the most crucial part in this study include ground water utilization labour use pattern besides other biotic a nd abiotic factors it has to be seen in the further parts of this study that how significant ro le these resources play in the present agricultural s ituation of punjab second characteristic to be consid ered is the specific land use pr actices these include certain type of agricultural practices which are followe d by farmers in the area these can include the cropping pattern resource manage ment techniques these variants also affect the agricultural system as they directly influence the ecology of the area thirdly the skills of the farmers in this case are very important there awareness level regarding environmental problems and their skills affect their approach towards the whole profession their understanding of the problem and the response can determine the outcome trends in agriculture it remains to be seen that how does this model f it into the findings of this study but definitely it shows the link between the farm ers and resources which can lead to a stable or vulnerable agroecosystem i have used sustainable development concept as it is becoming increasingly clear that a more sustainable agriculture can bring economic envi ronmental and social benefits yet despite the emerging evidence most farmers are still locked into modernist approaches to agriculture which are dependent on high leve ls of external inputs i am looking at the scale of the challenge facing agriculture toda y and detail the concepts and characteristics of alternative sustainable agricultural practices specially when there is also growi ng evidence that green revolutionstyle farming is not ecologically sustainable shiva 1991 this concept is ideally suited to my study because punjab presently is facing agricultural sta gnation and this study is an attempt to find out the link between the farm ers and the farming of the state for possible answers to the problem 34so according to two core requirements of sust ainable development the diversity of system and the basis of its productivity must be mainta ined secondly the society must organize itself so that this is easy to achieve and that the society must have the capability and ability to solve and preferably prevent its major problems in a timely fash ion eg framers should be educated about the environment problems resulting due to faulty practices and discourage them for early transplantation of rice to minimize ill effects on ecology 34 political ecology the most cited definition of political ecology was articulated by blaikie and brookfield 1987 to encompass the constantly shifting dialectic between society and landbased resources the context of political ecology thus emphasises that humanenvironment relations at local regional and global scal es can be only understood by an alysing the relationships of patterns of resource use to pol itical economic forces grossman 1977 this however implies that political ecology gives central concern to human agency in the transformation of the complex interacting web that characte rises the environment turshen 1984 bassett 1988 argues that the political ecology approach includes the importance of historical analysis in understa nding local dynamics the effects of state policies activities on the local scale and the effects of local ch anges in humanenvironment relations on the structures of social relations the effects of state policy and action are inherent in political ecology it is very important to unders tand the impact of politics on the economic scene because the economic setback is often the result of proce ss which constitutes pow er and recourses chris 1990 explains this relationship by givi ng an example about how situations are effected by changes at different levels for exam ple if the demand for certain type of crop is reduced then the government will not increase th e minimum support price which will lead to farmers getting less money as compared to inputs they have used the smallest farmers will be the hardest hit as they dont posses suffici ent reserve money further more because many households need cash urgently to settle debts purchase essentia l supplies or meet unexpected costs so they take loans a nd eventually fall in the visc ous circle of debt the poorest 35households will be most vulnerable and will lose mo st in this process apart from the relation between polity and economy there is a strong relation between polity and environment through the study of political ec ology we can understand that the environmental issues are also social issues blaikie 1985 reasons fo r this are because any environmental changes will have an effect on the people of the area secondly these environmental issues need the political expression to highlig ht them blaikie and brookfield 1987 attest to the fact that resource problems are approached by examini ng the social order in dynamic relationship with environment political ecology highlights issues of power and the obstacles they present to the achievement of the objectives of sustainable development specifi cally it examines social and political inequities and their impacts on the environment and the people who depend on it for their livelihoods the discipline of political ecology seeks to links the two theoretical concepts of political economy and ecological analysis and de velops some insights that challenge those involved in reducing the impact of the revolution and making agriculture both sustainable and adequate fo r a growing human population according to tim hayward1998 explains how human interests bear on ecological values focussing in particular on how ra tional self interest and enlightened self interest can be harnessed towards environmental end the first consideration is that while many environmental problems are attributed to the prevalence of narrow essentially private and economic interest franz hartmann 1998 has explained two view s about political ecology one being the non specialist view which advocates changes in gove rnment policies to create an environmentally sustainable society the other view is called th e popular view defines ecological politics as a complex subject it advocates better understandi ng between nature and society it refers to finding the causes of environmental problems rather than simply changing government policies hartmann also advocates the socio ecological theory of reality according to this theory he doesnt view nature and society as two different forces but considers that there is a reality which is the product of social and ecol ogical forces and the physical aspect of this reality is the build environment in this theory of reality ecological forces include soil climate etc whereas social forces include habi ts customs institutions etc according to him 36social forces are a distinct subset of ecologica l forces since humans have the ability to form social relations that affect thei r behaviour and ecological relations world commission on environment and devel opment 1987 revealed that sustainable development concept should include a political system that in sures people participation a social system that provides for solutions produc tion system that preserves the ecological base of for development and an administrative system that is flexible and has the capacity for self correction political ecology includes the effects of state policies activities on the local scale and the effects of local changes in human environment re lations on the structures of social relations political ecology pursues the importance of initia ting interactive learning approach in which there is a conscious decision to put people priorities first to maximize the gains for the poor and to highlight the importance of selfhelp ar e considered as ingredients of success in political ecology approach sustainable agri cultural development cannot be pursued in isolation its success depends on its place within an infrast ructural development which complements and reinforces sustainable policie s and programmes of the state the most important aspect of this approach is the applic ation of political will in the desired and positive direction proper economic analysis of policy options especially of their impact on small and marginal farmers is crucial while formula ting long term goals and strategies economic evaluation of environmental impact should also be considered political ecological perspective intents to integrate the political economic and ecological dimensions of agricultural management political ecology involves an evalua tion of the sociopolit ical role of different actors in human environmental interactions particularly in the third world where environmental problems attract multidisplinary solutions the linkage s between institutions resources individuals and societies which form the core of political ecology have generated various approaches to perception and applicati on of this concept based on the blaikie 1998 development of a chain of explanati on for a specific environmental concern i have tried to portray th e current problem with th e help of some links between the certain outcomes a nd the role of the state 37 historically punjab was at th e forefront of the green revolu tion in the late 1960s and early 1970s in which farm machinery pesticides and fe rtilisers irrigation an d the replacement of traditional crops with highyielding varieties dr amatically increased productivity but the land is increasingly unable to support this burden of intensive agri culture crop yieldsand water resourcesare showing signs of decrease and some parts of the state are even close to becoming barren many farmers are heavily in debt trap due to st agnating agriculture the economic benefits are lappe d up by a few while the long term fallout is affecting thousands of poor farmers indeed it seems that the farmers themselves are bearing the costs of the green revolution at this stage the ro le of government needs to be reviewed and necessary policy changes and plans to be put in place to make these changes work the state needs the true ability to implement new progra mmes with strong political will and the desire to change the things for better in case of punjab we have the role of the st ate which is responsible for government policies which should be formulated for the benefit of small and marginal farmers who would change their farming practices and current recourse ba sis to meet the positive change in ecology only if these policies have appropr iate economic incentives second key role is played by the abilities of the administration which are eval uated by the degree of involvement in their design and implementation of the projects fa rmers response in sustaining the programmes and projects will be determined by their involvement which is again linked to the administrative capacities of the state thirdly action plans would access the states power to influence a particular structure these plans and programmes for sustainable development will only be properly implemented if the appropriate institutional framework is established these action plans should include an alternative path for the farmers in order to make them shift swiftly to desired stage clubbed with the role of the state are the land us ers resources skills and nature of agrarian society this includes the knowledge among th e farming community their awareness level and their access to resources this also includes the level of agricultural skills and techniques 38with which they are customized this aspect can easily be altered with the input of knowledge in terms of institutional help and policy guidance these two links lead us to the stage of specifi c land use practices which in case of punjab has lead to twocrop dominance and high crop intensit y the failure of the state and the ignorance of the farmers have led to these negative land use practices which now lead us to physical changes in land system which is the most crucia l stage in relation to ecology due to specific land use practices there is decline in ground wate r to alarming levels an d deteriorating soil health it will be seen in the study ahead that what kind of consequences these agricultural practices have on the farmers of the state according to biggs et al 1991 the political science and public administration approaches to understanding research instituti ons go beyond identifying the spec ific interest groups such studies take into account the internal dynamics of beaurocratic instit utions and the way in which they interact with other institutions also policies to improve the institutional performance of public sector re search systems must grapple w ith the specifics of a system particularly with resource allo cations and the short run effi ciency of system components that is why political science models do have a major potential for helping policymakers in agricultural research 35 summary the approaches which deal with the relations hip between human and environment form the main theoretical framework of this study vari ous perspectives of the human environment have been captured the issues which are re lated to the problem of the study have been highlighted in this chapter the main perspectives run from showing res ource management and the role of political institutions results and discussions which follow it is hoped will throw light on the relationship between farmers and their environmen t and its effects in the next chapter i discuss the methodology adopted for collecting an alysing and presenting data for the study 39chapter four research approach and methodology 40 introduction the theoretical framework of this study combines environmental as well as societal aspects in geography it deals with the rela tionship between farmers ecology and resources it also takes into account the role of institutions with regard to the above mentioned relations many approaches have advocated the combination of environmental and social science perspectives in studying the complex issues related to environment society and resource management blaikie and brookfield 1987 blaikie 1995 the issues related to envi ronmental degradation are not only technical but al so socio economic the whol e relationship between actors involved is complex and requires wider approach to deal with i took into account these considerations and adopted appropriate approaches which allowed some level of flexibility in the research design this research work aims to study the reasons of agricultural stag nation and the possible relationship between the cause an d effects of this stagnation th is chapter concentrates on the criteria adopted for the collection both primary and secondary and processing of data for this research it also highlights re search design limitations and weakness of the study conducted this chapter also evaluates the validity and reliability of the collected data research methodology is a coherent set of ru les and procedures which can be used to investigate a phenomenon or situ ation kitchin and tate 2000 social science seeks to generate knowledge about the world by usin g mainly two methods viz quantitative and qualitative in geography criticism of the qu antitative revolution in geography and the subsequent emergence of the cultural turn have resulted into search for alternative ways of understanding the world attempts have been made to make distinction between the two philo et al 1998 describes quantitative geographers as those who count map and model things whereas qualitative geographers conve rse engage and empathise with the people world in my view the researcher has to ma ke a choice predominantly on the basis of research questions to select approaches a nd methods most likely to provide insight and 40explanation into matters of concern the select ion of methods or sampling also depends upon time available for research resources av ailable in terms of manpower and cost i mainly used qualitative as well as quantitati ve techniques for this research study while qualitative methods were used for getting farmers perceptions and official responses quantitative methods were used for assessing the economic situation of the farmers quantitative technique was also used to show sp ecial cases for environmental degradation like ground water decline soil fertility etc as qualitative data is subjectiv e rich and indepth information normally presented in the subjective form this approach is holistic as the result we get more accurate reflection of complex reality and a better unders tanding of the processes but as a weakness it is difficult to focus and analyse findings while doing indepth face to face fieldwork we can obtain better rapport with respondents but at the same ti me this requires skilled investigators 41 research rationale approach and strategy the reason to choose the present study topic lies within my curiosity to find the answers to some of the developments in my home state of punjab as being a punj abi i felt concerned about the condition of farmers in the state wh ich were often in the headlines regarding depression and suicides so it was my personal desire and real ization of the existing needs that i thought it was certainl y a necessity for better in my state any contribution on the positive note through my proposed study towards th e people of my state will be the ultimate reward for conducting this study both qualitative and quantitative data sources were employed during the survey the starting point of this work has been to study the relation between farmers and the scenario of agriculture in the state three districts were selected for the study where research was carried as the result data material is based on the inpu ts from these three districts covering a variety of techniques the aim was to collect the real time information from the farmers both relating to their socio economic conditions and thei r agricultural sector quantitative methodology has been used mainly for this study particularly the structured techniques of data collection like the use of questionnaires qualitative met hods used include interviews group and focus group discussions direct observation was also taken into account while visiting study area these are the techniques which gi ve broad contact between the re searcher and the researched 41the multimethod approach has an advantage of being complementary and reinforcing in formation on quantitative data was collected by the help of structured questionnaires providing useful information about households agricultural details both agricultural and social variables the qualitative data was enhanced through convers ation interviews and focus group discussions as well as direct observation also help ed to monitor social linkages and cultural rules farmers opinions attitudes perceptions and responses to agricultural concerns institutions are other relevant in formation generated through such means in order to reap the advantages of the tec hniques both methods of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods have been used the aims of qualitative analysis may be described as getting a total understanding of specific relati ons going in dept a nd developing hypotheses and theories while quantitative analysis is ai med at achieving a representative overview of general relations testing hypothese s and theories for quantitative studies data analysis and interpretation has to be carried out after the w hole process is finished whereas in qualitative analysis it is possible to carry out data analys is and interpretation almost parallel to its collection also in qualitative st udy we can easily mould the data as there are no standardised analysis techniques like in quantitative which include computation by stastical techniques and tables etc where of course at one end qualitative technique is more flexible but at the same time material may become over complex while it all depends upon the res earcher as many of the techniques can be used in either way of data collection qualitativ e interpretations can also be quantified and very often a combination method method triangulation of many methods is useful although these two methods are participation orient ed there are some differences that determine the choice of either qualitative or quantitative me thods in social science research 42 choice of study area and sample respondents the fieldwork for this research was conducted in the three districts of the state refer to map on page 14 as i wanted to get an overall picture of the punjab state regarding the different factors under study as mentioned in the introduction section punjab state is divided in to 17 different districts these dist ricts are further divided into tehsils and subtehsils for the making the good governess and accountability possible as i was facing the limitation of the 42time allotted for fieldwork i choose 3 differe nt districts in a way representing the whole punjab state among these were h oisarpur district representing th e semi hill area of the state with good quality underground water and having hi gher percentage of l iterate population in the state the second district was my home district ludhiana which represents the most industrialized area of punjab w ith an average literacy rate th e third district was mansa which represents one of the most backward area s in respect of education and exposure of the people in this district ground water here is brackish or not very suitable for agriculture selection of these three districts was influenced by many factors primarily i wanted to cover all the characteristics of the state in terms of geography economy and social as well so i tried to get at least one di strict under this study having different characteristics both geographical and cultural within the state of course time and resource constraints were taken into consideration while deciding for the selection selection of study villages was al so based on the criteria to get wider representation from different parts even within the selected districts firstly two tehsils were selected from each district while making sure that they were from two different parts of the same district then from each of those two tehsils tw o villages were selected on th e same selection pattern that is how four villages were selected from each district three main factors were considered wh ile the selection of these villages firstly those villages were not considered which were too close to the city so as to avoid any semi urban characteristics it was made sure that the sele cted villages were purely agricu ltural where majority of the population is involved in agri culture and not having any s ubstantial industrial plant the selected villages should not be under any special government improvement schemes or the particular village was not considered if it was a adopted as a model village sample respondents for the study were farmers acro ss these three districts agriculture as an occupation was considered as a criteria for c hoosing the respondents the preliminary survey in the area helped to identify key informants like the village heads agricultural extension officers or any well informed person from th at area based on the information provided by these informants relative respond ents were contacted this in cluded visiting farmers houses or locating them at the common place in the villa ge participants for the interviews or focus 43group discussions were also selected randomly orand purposively farmers were comprised of landowners farmers as well as tenant farmers 421 sampling techniques as mentioned above three districts were chosen for the fieldwork to be carried out among these districts i further choose two tehsils in every district a nd then two villages for every tehsils resulting in my data collection which comes from 4 villages for every district i used ten questionnaires for every village to investig ate the experiences reactions and assessments of the involved group altogeth er i collected 120 questionnaires across 3 districts of the state sampling is of great importance because it narrows down the large number of potential respondents to a smaller fraction i used simple random sampling technique for data collection i didnt use snow ball sampling techni que because i think it could have lead to biased data collection because a rich farmer can refer me to another farmer in his category and vice versa the other reason was the non ava ilability of economic an d housing statistics to support other empirical techniqu es and of course time was a big factor which prevented a detailed and extensive coverage although purposiv e sampling was used while interviewing specific individuals from the agri cultural institutions for the study by doing the data collection in a bove said three districts of the state i was able to compile a comprehensive and systematic picture of the stat e it helped me to get an idea about the conditions all over the state as the whole state is represented by these agricultural patterns the advantage of restricting my study to these three districts across th e state was that i was able to save a lot of time and moreover it a llowed me to study the na ture of problem with better depth i was able to know the farmer s perception and institutional attitude towards research problem 43 data collection and sources in order to fulfil the goal of my study data on several aspects of agricultural socioeconomic conditions and resource management were coll ected both qualitative and quantitative types of data were collected from two main sour ces secondary and primary primary data was 44solicited from the respondents at the village level through questionnai re survey informal interviews group discussions a nd field observations documents reports published and unpublished books from relevant in stitutions departments cons tituted the main secondary sources of data the first step in the process wa s to review literature on the area this was done in order to become acquainted with the inform ation available and to collect relevant secondary materials on the topic and the area where av ailable this was done in first two weeks of the fieldwork in the districts of ludhiana hosiar pur and mansa short visits to these districts were made prior to data collection to get acquainted with the se lected area the actual field survey commenced thereafter with the conversat ions interviews questionnaire administration and focus group discussions the above mentioned me thods of data collection were facilitated with the help of community leaders and key informants the reason for this multimethod approach is its rapid and systematic collection or generation of information related to key questions a nd variables on resource management mitchell 1997 these techniques helped to gain a deep er knowledge about the views and the problems from the point of view of farmers the fieldwork was conducted in the summer br eak from june to early august which co incided with the ri ce cultivating season 44 primary data primary data was collected from local farmers traditional authorities opinion leaders and government officials at district level prim ary information was elicited on local farming issues land use type cropping pa ttern size of land holdings perceptions of environmental problems level of assistance were some of the variables on whic h data was collected questions were also asked c oncerning conservation issues th e methods employed to collect primary data are discussed in the following sub sections 441 questionnaires questionnaires are one of the most widely us ed fieldwork methods in human geography face to face interaction forms the co rner stone in collecting data ev en though that the quality of data collected can vary enormously from st udy to study depending on the complexity and 45sensitivity of the questionnaire and on the targ et sample the questionnaire survey is an indispensable tool when it come to primary da ta collection about peopl e their behaviour and their awareness levels with rega rd to agriculture in this study data were acquired mainly through the administration of st ructured questionnair es to respondents the questionnaires were build according to the information required to fulfil the aims of this research indepth interaction through these questi onnaires helped me to study s ubjective meanings and motives alongside the more objectifiable attributes and aspirations that were trapped by structured questions questionnaires were structured and co mposed of two sections section a dealt with baseline data about household an d preliminary agricultural surv ey section b part composed of more specific agricultural and ecological ac tivities this section also included questions about economic and ecological aspects questi ons were mostly openended and respondents in this case farmers were encouraged to express their own perceptions in their own words the major input data included la nd holdings animal power labou r canal water fertilizer pesticides and capital separately for tractors di esel tube wells and el ectric tube wells land was valued at the average costs incurred per hect are which include the rental value of owned value rent paid for leasedin land and land re venues any extra income from livestock was computed from the number of animals reared it was appropriately calculated by multiplying the units of milk by its price in punjab major irrigation is provided thro ugh tube wells and in some areas by canal water these two sources of irrigation were recorded to know their specific impact on agricultural patterns this also helped in getting an idea about the costs incurred on fuels and electricity in case of tube wells capital value was evaluated in terms of their operational costs agricultural implements and labourthrough the data collection the analys is was conducted for different phases of agricultural changes 1 green revolution196573 the period begi nning with the introduction of hyvs high yielding varietiesand ending up with their widespread ad option when approximately 85 percent of the wheat area was planted to hyvs the period was marked by a rapid increase in fertilizer use punjab expe rienced high rates of crop prod uction growth during the green revolution 2 post green revolution period 1975 onwards this period is marked with outstanding crop productions modern technology like tractors othe r agricultural implements became common this period was marked by changes in crop patt ern all over the state the major change in 46crop pattern was in the form of rice crop wh ich once introduced in limited areas spread rapidly through out the state this period witn essed surplus food grain production by the state 2 recent trends 1990 onwards a period when fertilizer us e levelled off as diminishing returns set in sidhu and byerl ee 1992 this is the time peri od which is referred to as stagnating period in agricultur e the farmers and farming of the state are facing negative trends in economic and environmen tal issues it can be said that punjab is payi ng the price for green revolution definitely the use of questionnaires made the data collection more arranged and on specific pattern which helped in coding of data and then doing analysis less complex during the data collection productivity estimate s in appropriate perspective major characteristics of the agricultural sector were taken into account but while in the field in many cases the questions needed to be reformulated or adjusted it was necessary to be sensitive to which que stions are relevant and meaningful some respondents preferred not to answer the questi ons directly so questions were posed around the issue to take a general view from the re spondent the same questi on may mean different things to different people due to different background academic training etc therefore questions had to be reformulated in many situ ations and some even had to be avoided in some cases some of the questions were obviously too abstract or too poorly formulated the background of the farmers varied from obligatory school and a life as farm farmer and farmer to well educated farmer some people were with very less experience in agricultural work i started out with a deta iled questionnaire for farmers wher e appropriate all issues were followed up otherwise they were cut down the questionnaires were administered in the form of interview the help of a research assistant was taken who was also an post graduate from the punjab agricultural university questions were read and interpreted into more familia r words in the punjabi language the use of punjabi language helped to develop a good working relation with the respondents and the local people in general many farmers were enthusiastic about participation in the survey because they wanted somebody to listen to thei r feelings and concerns this feeling gave a sense of responsibity while performing the fieldwork while starting the questionnaire survey in villag es i introduced myself to the farmers and my purpose of the visit i ha d to take them into confidence that this data was only for research and 47not for any kind of tax evaluation i tried my best to be as simple and connected to the farmers as possible and it was facilitated by the fact that my family profe ssion is also agriculture so it helped me to know many things in a dvance to the resear ch continuation 442 interviews the main methodological approach of the st udy is listening to the relation between the farmers and agricultural instituti ons and trying to relate them with regard to the objectives of the study an interview guide to a varying degr ee was followed for the purpose some of the interviews were very structured especially w ith the officials of both agricultural university and government department whereas interviews with farmers may be described as informal informant interviews the longest framer in terview took about three hours including some refreshments and walks around the fields the shortest some 15 minutes talking about general conditions and weather some of the farmers were very open and thes e interviews may be characterised as qualitative indepth interviews in general farmers were easy to interview a nd often very willing to expose their views and experiences farmers were open to their priv ate situation in agricultural and economical situation as they often defined themselves as weak as compared to government and service sector formal interviews with the agricultural professors of the university generated official answers however they were friendly in res ponses about their own institution problems and conflicts with other agricultural agencies five public officials were interviewed from both agricultural department and the punjab agricultural university directly concerning the role of their respective institutions in the agricultuture of punjab mainly their contributio ns actions and future plans three agricultural officials were interviewed from punjab agriculture university at ludhaina these officials were agricultural professors from plant br eeding department as well as extension and economics department while two officials were from department of agriculture punjab government who were interviewed at chandigarh as planned earlier i kept on noting the interv iew on the paper and tr ied to examine them daily however with an intensive fieldwork of just two months it became difficult to cope with all modalities 48443 focus group discussions focus group discussions are one of the semistructured methods of data collection i carried out three focus group discussions each in one district discussions were conducted along a checklist of structured main topics the disc ussions were arranged before meeting and the head of the village was norma lly present there throughout the course of discussion during these discussions respondents discussed topic re lating to agriculture both with me and within them there were usually around 10 farmers involved in these discussions and used to continue even when we were satisfied w ith the discussing time i think focus group discussions helped me a lot to understand th e perceptions and behaviours among the farmers towards the general agriculture and institutions it also generated important data on useful issues such as farming problems and responses in teresting fact was that even a lot of farmers were nearly illiterate still they expressed them selves with confidence and wanted their voice to be heard 444 field observation observation is one of the oldest methods of scientific information collection and reporting field visits offer ample opportuni ties to observe and record information that is visible and direct observation is fundament al and critical method in all qualitative research it plays an important role particularly in qualitative informat ion as it is a supplementary survey to fill the gap left by other survey methods participant observation wile doing discussions may give important links to the data being collecte d it helped me to observe some economic conditions social and cultural happenings in the place i being a punjabi was much comfort for respondents who allowed me to talk openl y often in their houses which gave me the opportunity to use my observation skills but at the same time scope of observation feels to be limited as it cannot provide any informa tion about the opinions and attitudes of the respondents generally observati on was useful in getting a be tter understanding of context cross checking information and possible differe nces between what people do and what they say it helped me to explore the group working patterns social dynamics in the society social interaction 4945 secondary data secondary data denotes using al ready existing information which is not originally collected for the ongoing project this was generated fr om published as well as unpublished sources secondary data for the study was collected fr om various sources for the research study initially i have been relying on internet for general overvie w i went through the relevant study material from different agricultural instit utions but mainly from punjab agricultural university in ludhiana ministry of agricult ure punjab government and ongoing projects in this field i also consulted some non government al organisations working in this field state wide i also visited the major libraries at the agricultural university and other departmental libraries data was collected with a high level of de tail from secondary so urces and the indian directorate of economics and statis tics the library facilities of punjab agricultural university and norwegian university of science and techno logy as well as other departmental and other institutional sources were use d emphasis was given to project s and studies which had been conducted in this regard maps in the study were taken from we bsites on the internet various relevant websites were used to collect inform ation about the research which particularly played an important role as the present rese arch was area specific and was more difficult to find relevant information while being away from the study area 46 data analysis and presentation data analysis is a process of bringing order structure and meaning to the mass of collected data marshall and rossmann 1995111 the research conducted uses both primary and secondary methods of data collection some of the quantitative data was also collected for accessing the environmental aspect in the study the data was organised and analysed by the help of microsoft excel the data was first lo aded into excel sheets before being able to visualize any kind of results or patterns because much of the data collected according to the study were descriptive in nature so they were explained direc tly otherwise quantifiable data is presented by the help of tables bar pie di agrams and percentages figures are regularly used to present relevant variables the open ended questions were dealt separately 5047 limitation and weaknesses of the study in the study which revolves around economic as well as social aspects substantial methodological problems can be incurred while in the field i also encountered some problems which i would like to pres ent as the weakness of the study according to the requirements of research th e questionnaire which wa s constructed had many questions aiming at getting economic infrastructu re of the farmers on many occasions even after assuring the farmers many thought that i wa s from the tax department and were afraid of any kind of negative consequences on their earnings so there are possibilities that the data particularly relating to economic deali ng may be corrupted to some extend other limitations which were felt dur ing the fieldwork are as follows a time limitation actually just after pr eparing the questionnaire and even before leaving for the fieldwork i had an idea th at the proposed data collection was quite much in to handle in the given time but it was only when i went in the field that i encountered many other problems which delayed my progression which includes taking appointments from various official s going to other districts by arranging transportation requesting some known peopl e to arrange some gathering for group discussions it was due to this limitation th at i had to almost rush through my data collection especially towards the end of th e time frame which certainly affected the quality and quantity of the data collecte d it was only after certain period when i realized that research assistant was essent ial to guide me through the time limit when the data was finally collected time constraint was still ther e as decoding the data and processing it into microsoft excel was a l ong time taking exercise so i can say that the time at my disposal was not enough for doing justice to extens ive data collection that covered both primary and secondary data b accessibility to data accessibility of da ta was a problem with the secondary data collection even after many rescheduling of appointments and many cancellations agricultural officers seemed none interested in revealing simple facts about the agriculture growth and related themes the study being done was not covering any confidential matters but still to my surprise officials were quite reluctant to release any information despite attempts contacti ng the agricultural department i was unsuccessful in getting hold of any form of written agricultural policy of the state it 51was only through some of the known professors in the agricultural university that i was able to get limited information out of those inaccessible public offices c physical barriers as per my decision to collect data from three different districts of the state it proved quite a challenge to c over these distances on frequent basis my home district ludhiana is situated in th e middle of the other two districts one being in the north and the other bei ng in the south arranging th e transport for the extensive travel which was undertaken in almost opposite directions was itself a constraint to my physical endurance some of the villages se lected for the coverage were influenced by their easy access just to prevent even longer travels a nd resultant delays coping with this limitation i managed to make my travels as efficient as i could by the help of friends apart from the above mentioned limitations incu rred during the research process there are some other hindrances which also made thei r present felt one worth mentioning was the weather during the time of the fi eldwork the temperatures in the state of punjab during june and july were regularly crossing 450 c mark which made the process of collecting data extremely uncomfortable specially while walki ng in the village and filling questionnaires in the end i can say that despite all the limitations mentioned it was a great experience specially to mention two mont hs of fieldwork where i learned a lot about the research activities this study has given me extreme sa tisfaction which i felt when i listened to the feeling and the problems of the farmers in th e field this study has encouraged me to work more specifically for the betterment of the peop le and i hope to utilize this experience in further operations 48 validity and reliability of data due to the above mentioned limitations this res earch study has some biases associated with different stages of the study it is therefore impor tant to assess the degr ee of objectivity in the conducted study reliability is th e degree to which the finding is independent of accidental circumstances that affect the accuracy of measur ements in the research while validity is the degree to which the findings are interpreted in a correct way kirk a nd miller 1986 validity 52helps to assess the justification of applied concepts measurement levels and data collection method it also deals with the question that wh ether the findings corre spond with theoretical concepts used the stated problems and the hypothesis if any confirmed or refuted the concern is that whether the results are able to do justice with the problems undertaken validity is extending to which the procedure gi ves the desired answer i analyse that the methods used for collecting the data have justif ied their application as i have been able to gather enough data for all the pr incipal aspects of the researc h data has been generated in accordance to environmental concerns social relevance and agricultural practices reliability is the extend to which a measurem ent procedure yields th e same answer how and when it is carried out that is whether observa tions and findings are c onsistent with other research using different methods of data co llection was aimed to solve the problem of unreliability observation and group discussions interviews were acting as a cross check for any regularities found during th e filling of questionnaires 49 summary in this chapter of the study i have mentioned the methods of data colle ction which were used in the fieldwork and also have expressed my e xperiences some of which were in the form of limitations it has been explaine d how by using different techni ques of collecting data have been used to accomplish the requirements of the study the aim was to use both the methods to their maximum use primary data was collect ed from respondents in form of questionnaires which were based on three districts and 12 v illages discussions interviews and field observations the secondary data was gathered from institutions of agriculture documents and reports both within the st udy area and outside different methods employed definitely enhanced the validity and reliability of the da ta and made it relevant for result analysis mentioned also are the limitations and weakne sses of the study the research strategy was competent enough to highlight the major findings and laid the foundation for an efficient analysis of the results collected through this data collection the coming chapter of this research work presents the changing trends in punjab agriculture over a time period 53chapter five changing trends of punjab agriculture 50 introduction punjabs agriculture has been shifting over the last 40 years but yet it remains a predominantly agrarian economy according to punjab government statics agriculture including livestock contributes 44 percent to the gross domestic product and about 70 percent of population in rural is engage d in this profession the green revolution initiated in mid sixties for wheat and early seventies for ri ce triggered a high gr owth trajectory the rapid growth in wheat and rice contributed s ubstantially to turn th e country from severe food deficit to food grain self sufficiency in 1975 76 punjab to day produces about 10 percent of the countrys rice 20 percent of its wheat and about 45 percent of all rice and wheat procured by the government punjab de velopment report 2004 but economic growth rate has been on the decline since the 1960s making punjab one of the slowest growing indian states during the 1990s singh and hossain 2002 despite or perhaps because of these achievements serious concerns are now em erging about the future prospects of punjab agriculture sector the growth of agriculture productivity was 554 percent from 196667 to 197778 and 652 percent from 197778 to 1984 85 it slowed down to 156 percent during the period 198485 to 198889 singh and grover 1991 decelerations in the overall gr owth as well as productivity per hectare are worrisome the post green revolution period has witnessed many changes in ecological and socioeconomic terms this chapter examines cr itical issues regarding these changes over a period of time in the state 51 pre and post green revolution era at the time of the partition of the country in 1947 indian punjab was a food deficit state in 1951 production of foodgrains was about 199 million tonne only of which wheat was 110 million tonne and rice 011 million tonne 544 per cen t of total gdp of the state originated from the agriculture sector joginder singh et al 1997 a lthough at that time also the cropping pattern was dominated by food grai n crops occupying 68 percent of the cropped 54area yet 38 percent of the area was cropped with pulses and coarse grains mainly on un irrigated lands with net area of 3544 thousan ds hectare and gross cropped area of 4170 thousand hectare intensity of cropping was 118 per cent only gill et al 1992 fertilizers and pesticides were not used by the farmers tube wells were conspicuous by their absence and tractors were not much in known in the state only 523 per cent of the area was irrigated and land holdings were quite fragmented lekhi et al 1986 soon after the independence the state started moving on a growth path with ma ndatory consolidation of land holdings which was considered a prerequisite for uti lisation of canal irrigation water according to pau sources after the land reforms were set in irrigated area increased to 54 per cent of the net sown ar ea and intensity of cropping improved to 121 per cent the cropping pattern was still dominated by wheat with 296 per cent of th e cropped area pulses 1908 per cent coarse grains 1052 per cent and cotton with 94 per cent of the cropped area of the state gross cropped area and net sown area increased marginally from 4170 thousand hectare and 3544 thousand hectare to 4732 thousand and 3757 thousands hectare respectively productivity of cr ops started improving but only ma rginally but this situation continued with only marginal improvements up to the mid60s the agricultural situation in the state changed dramatically as a consequence of consolidation of holdings availability of canal water tube well irrigation and establishment in 1962 of punjab agricultural university with strong research and extens ion education components that developed close interactive rela tionship with the st ate agriculturists introduction of dwarf wheat germ plasm and cultivators from cimmy t mexico in 196465 which could easily stand to higher use of fertiliz ers without lodging and required assured irrigation set the stage for wheatbased green revolution in the state with this conducive production environment a ssured remunerative prices provided by the government through price support and procurement system as well as spread of rural and approach roads network in the state productio n and productivity as well as gross domestic product from agriculture sector started improvi ng quite fast tractors and tube wells started dotting the landscape everywhere uses of fertilisers and pest icides expanded and irrigated area as well as intensity of cropping started in creasing even net sown area also increased cropping pattern started witnessing significan t changes the founda tions of the green revolution were thus laid and enabling in frastructural technological and economic 55environment was rendered conducive for the interaction of elemen ts of growth and productivity in the state the green revolutio n had already started showing results dwarf varieties of paddy were introduced and as the result producti on increased manifold net sown area increased from 376 million hectare in 196061 to 405 million hectares in 197071 gross sown area increased from 473 to 568 million hectare and intensity cropping improved from 121 to 140 percent over the same period cropping pattern underwent signif icant changes with area under wheat increasing from 296 per cent to 405 per cent of the total croppe d area per cent area under pulses declined drastically from over 19 per cent to 73 per cent by this time new dwarf varieties of rice from irri were introduced and the area under rice production started expanding as a result production of food grains in 197071 more than doubled to 73 million tonnes from 316 million tonnes in 19606 with wheat production increasing to 515 million tonnes rice had not as yet caught the imagination of the farmers although area under this crop and production had started increas ing and the future looked bright from 1970 onwards agricultural sector growth made a quantum jum p yet with the industria l and tertiary sector too growing fast share of agricultural sector in the gdp started declining which was in tune with classic model of growth and development of any economy this growth in agriculture initiated by green revolution in wheat crop pro duction in late sixties and further fuelled by rice revolution in mid70s continued unab ated under conducive commercial environment both on production as well as mark et fronts net sown area increased almost to its limit of over 42 million hectares with cropping intensity of 181 per cent the gross cropped area increased to over 62 million hectare in the cropping pattern wheat occupied 437 per cent of the gross cropped area with rice occupyi ng 286 per cent area the food grain crops accounted for 769 per cent of the gro ss cropped area sondhi et al 1995 the growth in the area under wheat and rice ha s increased on a rapid pace while the area under wheat was approximately around 24 thou sand hectares in 1970 71 and 35 thousand hectares in 2002 03 the area und er rice has even increased mu ch more the area under rice was below 5 hundred hectares in early sevent ies which increased steeply to 25 thousand hectares by 2002 03 the graph 1 show ing the area under rice and wheat from 1970 onwards is shown below 56 area under paddy wheat crops 000 ha 0500100015002000250030003500 197071 197273 197475 197677 197879 198081 198283 198485 198687 198889 199091 199293 199495 199697 199899 200001 200203paddywheat source singh et al 1997 the production of pulses and coarse grains go t marginalised relative area under oilseeds and sugarcane decreased cotton area however held on with marginal yet fluctuating increases overtime during this period pr oductivity improved dramatically with wheat and rice yield increasing this conducive economic environmen t gave impetus to ex pansion of tubewell irrigation tractor cultivation and intensive use of fertilisers fertiliser use increased from 54 kg per hectare of net area sown in 197071 to 2655 kg per hectare in 199394 pesticides use increased manifold kansal et al 1992 the number of tractors increased from 10 to 80 3 per thousand hectares of net sown area and tube wells number increased fr om 192 thousand to 850 thousands in the state area irrigated increased from 71 to 93 per cent of the net sown area the intensity of cropping increased to 181 per cent production of food grain incr eased to 2158 million tonne with wheat production at 1334 million tonne and rice 765 milli on tonne at present over 84 per cent of the total geographical area of the state stands cultivated and only a bout 28 thousand hectare land is classified as cultivable waste this meagre area represents terrain which are very difficult to cultivate the state looks like a vast farmstead with only 16 per cent of its geographical area under cities towns villages ri vers canals roads buildings wastes forests etc there is thus little scope for expansion of crop cultivation horizontally vertically the intensity of cropping is over 181 per cent there is thus hardly any scope for increasing the 57intensity of cropping further with the presen t set of main economic crops grown in the state so there have been many changes in the pre and post green revolution agricultural scenario in the state primarily two major aspects ecological and socio economic are discussed as below in the table 3 below we can see the major changes in the agricultu ral items of punjab important statistics of punjab 31 3 7 09 2 7 07 4 2 0 0 mi184 163 113 38 0 npk kgha950 800 600 192 13 t wells 000410 280 125 41 5 tractors 00096 90 81 71 54 irrigated area 186 178 161

changed among them is the net sown area which is almo st touching its maximum limit as discussed earlier that the cropping intens ity has increased due to dual f actors of limited land and more intensive cropping adopted by the farmers these f actors hold relevance because they indicate that the basic factors which ar e responsible for increasing th e productions hare already on their maximum utilization level the other variables shown in th e table include the number of tractors which have lead to mechanization in agriculture there has been drastic increase in the number of tubewells which give an additi onal support for irrigation the use of fertilizers has also increased manifold so as discussed and illustrated in this section of the chapter there have been considerable changes in th e pre and post green revolution period in the agriculture of punjab in order to understand the changes in a better way this chapter has been 58divided into two principle pe rspectives the ecological and the socio economic the ecological perspective is as follows 52 an ecological prospective 521 ground water water is life both the natural and human systems are critically dependent on water it is the primary requirement for not only the survival of human beings but also for their socio economic development and a healthy ecosystem in addition access to wa ter plays a critical role in poverty alleviation and food security bo th local and national the prevailing trends towards rising population in creasing urbanisation spr ead of more water intensive life styles as well as agricultural tec hnology sweeping around the world are going to make water resource even scarcer unless timely action is ta ken how to manage water has thus emerged as one of the great challenges of the 21st century attempts to minimise wastage and conserve water through more efficient management of irrigation systems at both macro and micro levels have to be pursued with renewed vigour there is an overriding need for sustai nable development and sound environmental management of water resources the aim should be towards sustainable longterm resource enhancement rather than mere shortterm e xploitation by strictly observing environmental considerations there should be increased understanding of in teraction between groundwater and food security at different levels the existing cr opping patterns adopted by farmers have led to overexploitation of ground wa ter and decline in water level as a consequence during the last three decades th ere has been a rapid decline in the gro und water in punjab except a few areas of southwest region high water requirements for paddy cultivation especially in the early transp lantation period is also largel y responsible for lowering water table grover et al 1990 the introduction of paddy in the state was made about 50 years ago to reclaim waterlogged and saltaffected soils subsequently because of profitability paddy replaced maize groundnut pulses and cotton crops 59due to increase in cropping intensity the tr aditional pattern of cr opping was forgotten and fields are under cultivation fo r almost 10 months a year this also contributes to over exploitation of groundwater till now the major source of irrigation according to a study by hira 1997 out of the states area of 503 million hectares 432 million hectares has a falling water problem th e state of the world report 1998 published by the washingtonbased world watch institute says the gap between water use and sustainable yield of the aquifer is so high that the aquifer unde r punjab could be depleted by the year 2025 according to k k mehta regio nal director of cent ral ground water board chandigarh in almost half of punjab the deple tion of water resources is leading to a crisis the crop intensity has increased in the last 30 years directly putting more pressure on the natural resources available for agriculture there has been a si gnificant change in the cropping pattern over the state the table 4 below de picts the shifts in cr op pattern in punjab shift in crop pattern 029 23 139 66 barley 4287 3404 2959 1400 wheat035 28 068

above we can see the shift in the cropping patterns rice which was occupying only 480 percent of the total crops in 196061 in creased substantially to 3186 percent of the total crops by 200203 on the other hand wheat increased its dominance from almost 30 percent to 43 percent with the increase in the dominance of these cr ops other crops have seen decline in their area maize which is the next important crop has de clined from 7 percent 60to 2 percent similar was the case with other crops like millets cotton and sugarcane pulses and groundnut is almost disappearin g from the agricultural fields of the state these shifts are important for ecology because the crop pattern influences the extraction of ground water which forms an important part of the irrigation av ailability for agriculture this shift in crop pattern assumes even more significance becaus e it is the irrigation of rice crop which is responsible for extraction of ground water in large quantities ground water is pumped up by the help of tubewells both while making nursery for the crop and for the transplantation as standing water is needed fo r the growth of rice crop there have been many studies depicting the gr oundwater situation in the state of punjab study about water resource development and management for sustainable agriculture production in punjab by narang et al 1995 shows that the to tal water resources available excluding unfit and marginally fit water in the state are 313 million ham as against the water requirement of 4377 million ham making a deficit of 1247 million ham the unfit water is here referred to as the brackish water found in the southwestern districts of the state which is not considered well e nough for agricult ural purposes another study on farm water management by sondhi and khepar 1995 shows that area under different water table depths in various di stricts during the last 20 years june 1973 and june 1994 is shown in table 5 below it ma y be seen that area under water table depth less than 5 meters has been reduced from 375 to 18 3 percent while area under 510 metre depth has increased from 42 to 50 percent similarl y the area under water table depth more than 10 meters has increased from 205 to 317 percent thus except in certain pockets of south western punjab water table has been steadily declining since after the spread of rice cultivation in punjab in 1970s table 5 showing area ha under different water table depths district 5 meters 10 meters june 1973 june 1994 june 1973 june 1994 amritsar 220700 41600 24000 49100 bathinda 137900 148900

percent of annual net recharge in addition there are 7 blocks in which the exte nd of exploitation is above 85 percent of the remaining 38 blocks 15 fall in grey category with 6885 percent of net annual recharge to groundwater leaving thus only 33 blocks in the white category this over exploitation is due to the increase in the numb er of tubewells from 192 lakh in 197071 to 870 lakh in 199394 sondhi and khepar 1995 it has been estimated that by replacing about 5 lakh ha under rice crop in sele cted areas with maize groundnut pulses soyabean and bajra fo dder about 775 thousand ha m water

62this can reduce the exploitation of ground wate r by rice crop whose continuous extension of cultivation on more and more sandy soils as we ll as because of intensity of cropping is responsible for increasing the gap between water availability and its requirements for irrigation purposes in the state another study conducted is susta ining asias groundwater boom an overview of issues and evidence by tushar et al 2003 he has explained the situation of punjab and the consequences which could happe n if the trends continue the situation of punjab in the context to presen t problem is explained below in the form of a figure 2 source tushar et al 2003 as we see from the diagram the state of p unjab is kept in stage 3 which shows early symptoms of groundwater over draft the stage 1 refers to the period of 1970s in the state when the green revolution was ushered with th e characteristics of importance on traditional 63crops with the rise in irrigati on by tubewells the stage 2 refe rs to the splendid results of green revolution with rise in pr oductivity of crops and income the stage 3 where the punjab state is presently kept is ch aracterised by steep decline in water level and the tensions between economy and ecology have started to surface the groundwater pumping costs increase rapidly as the farmers have to deepen their tubewells after short spans to meet the declining water table size of agrarian economy is high th at shows the state economy is dependent on agriculture so it will have an adverse effect on the economic level if there is ecological disaster like water level depleti on in coming years the groundwater extraction worm is at its highest position in the stage 3 showing the imbalance between the recharge and extraction once this stage is cros sed it leads to to tal collapse of the ecology and thus of economy water level decline has been one of the major ecologi cal changes in the post green revolution period in punjab 522 burning of paddy straw apart from water being one of the most sensitiv e links of the ecological prospective another issue has been the burning of paddy straw paddy straw is the part of the rice crop which remains standing in the field after the rice is ha rvested it is needed to be cleared from the fields before anything else can be grown in the same fi eld as the area under rice has increased since the advent of green revoluti on the problem of paddy st raw burning has also increased alarmingly picture above shows the paddy straw burning and the resultant thick smoke generated 64the 16 million tones of rice straw that is burnt every year punjab development report 2004 results in air pollution creating suffocating smog like conditions in most parts of the state at the time of rice harvests during the fieldwork survey question was asked to find out the percentage of the farmers who burn the paddy straw it was found out that 68 percent of the farmers said yes that they burned the straw of paddy while 32 percent of the farmers used it in some alternative ways it has been displayed in figure 3 below sourcefieldwork june2004 this percentage is considerable keeping in mind the health hazards caused due to smoke emitted as the result of burning of paddy stra w burning of the paddy straw not only causes smoke clouds but is also harmful for the soil mi crobial activity this is resulting in increased levels of carbon monoxide carbon dioxide methan e nitrogen and other gases which caused a lot of air pollution it forms clouds of smog which could not easily be dispersed away but the most surprising fact which came to light during the group discussions was that majority of the farmers gave the reason that th ey did this practice in order to save time and due to lack of knowledge about how to handle or mange it university authorities upon contacted said that there were several availabl e ways to use this st raw like processing crop residues potential forestry and grasses to produce card board paper and plywood but declined to give any reason behi nd not been able to convince the farmers to use paddy straw in a better way another kind of pollution is caused by dispos al of livestock waste in the state upon surveying it was found that 58 percent of the farm ers used the waste of livestock for burning percentage of farmers who burn paddy straw yes no 65as a fuel which causes a lot of smoke and possi bly respiratory problems only 38 percent of the farmers were using this waste as farm ya rd manure while only 4 percent of the farmers used it in the gobar gas plants a plant where animal waste is used to prepare cooking gas by the action of bacteria 53 a socio economic prospective the state has undergone many social and econom ic changes during the period of post green revolution it is beyond doubt that the eco nomic condition has improved in terms of materialistic items during the survey questionnaires were used to get the data relating to social and economic parameters in order to have a be tter idea of the change s time series of 10 years was adopted for many social and economi c issues these changes will help to build up the relationship between the agricultural stag nation and the socioeconomic conditions of the farmers in the state below are the result s which were collected during the fieldwork in process of household survey farmers were questioned about the below select ed household materials and were asked about their possession both presently and approximately 10 years ago it was seen that there was considerable improvement in the household ma terialistic goods posse ssed by the farmers 2 see appendix i this increase in the household possession can be interp reted in two ways firstly it can be seen as the general increas e in the domestic expenditure by the farmers which could eventually lead to more economic burden keeping in mind that majority of the farmers belong to small farmer category in order to meet these household expenses the farmer is most likely to take loans and thus ca n land in the vicious circle of loans and debts the reason for going in for these materials is of ten associated with personal prestige in the society or potential show off secondly this trend of increase can be seen as a re sult of improve d alternative incomes apart from agriculture in other words stagnating agri culture can be seen as a blessing in disguise for these farmers because some of the small farmers had actually tried to move out of agriculture by aliening themselves with other secondary activitie s so as the result started receiving some kind of secondary income in a way this trend is encouraging for the farmers and farming of the state 66this trend can also be relate d to one of the findings accord ing to which 84 percent of the farmers reported that they would not like to engage their next ge neration in agriculture if they were given alternative choice of profession farmers were asked about their exposure toward s the mass media this question was included to know about their expos ure to new things in agricultura l scene or social farmers were asked about their exposure level to differe nt sources of knowledge it was found that television and personal contacts are the two largest source s of knowledge to the farmers in villages 55 percent of the farmers said that they watched televisi on everyday for news and agricultural related programmes different respon ses in percentage are shown below in table 7 below source high exposure moderate exposure low exposure television 55 19 26 radio 8 32 60 newspaper 27 41 32 personal contacts 54 11 45 source field work june 2004 this section holds importance because it deals with the different economic and social symptoms of the farmers which are crucial to k now in order to find out that if there are any socioeconomic reasons behind agricultural stagnation 54 summary punjab agriculture has gone th rough many changes both ecologi cal and social perspectives have been discussed above ecological changes we re broadly classified into decline in water level and burning of paddy straw socio ec onomic changes were taken into account by the help of detailed data on households these chan ges will form the basis to know if there are any ecological or economic reasons behind agricu ltural stagnation in the coming chapter this information from the questionnaires cannot be se en an independent in itself but the study will help in interconnecting the relations between diffe rent factors the next chapter of the study deals with the actual issues dealing with agriculture 67chapter six agricultural stagnation an insight view 60 introduction much of the punjabs growth slowdown originat ed from the agricultural sector its output grew at the trend rate of 26 percent per annum in the 1990 s compared to the all india average of 32 percent and almost half of th e growth rate of 5 percent per annum in the 1980s punjab statistical department worse th e current agricultural pr actices seem to be environmentally unsustainable punjab now has the highest percentage of ground water exploitation in the country and also the larg est percentage of over exploitation and dark blocks punjab development report 2004 it se ems that the prolonged dominant monoculture of wheat rice has now resulted in deceleration of agricultural growth as well as productivity per ha all these factors play a cr ucial role in determining the agricultural future of the state this chapter looks at the some of the result s which were determined by the fieldwork study relating to agricultural stagnation 61 land use land is one of the most important natural recourses the magnitude of agricultural activities largely depends upon the quantity and quality of land resources and the manner in which they are utilized the state lacks in terms of mine rals but having loca tion advantage of water availability levelled land and a ppropriate climate the entire land is virtually made fit for agricultural purposes another u tilization of land lately ha s been covered by forests some other options like social fo restry could have been adopted th e forest area in the state is concentrated mainly in semi hilly tracts of hosiarpur ropar and gurdaspur districts though social forestry is not profitable as compared to common crops except in case of marginal lands yet plantation can be dine vigorously cha tha et al 1986 the kandi belt of the state has vast potential of plantation especially the traditional forest and fruit trees land utilization has important ecological implications the cha nges from one land use to another are often made to achieve better economic use of la nd resources however many changes have detrimental effect on the natural environment ie conversion of pastures into agricultural land industrial sitting in prime agricultural ar ea increase in urbaniza tion land use plans the potential environmental conflicts between adjacent land uses should be given due 68consideration due to absence of any other majo r utilization of land agriculture remains at the forefront therefore the dependency on produc tivity from agriculture assumes much significance 611 crop intensity the increase in cropping intensity and decline in uncultivable and barren land provide land with vegetative cover for the most part of th e year and no doubt it has benefit of checking the wind erosion and water erosion but at the same time it leads to the immense pressure on the land and soil nutrients available for agriculture the land is hardly left fallow and the crops are grown in quick succesion preventing the en ough airing of the soil and replacement of the natural contents of the soil in the farms as the further expansion of area horizontally is extremely limited in punjab it has lead to intense cropping on the land during the fieldwork it was found that majority of the farm ers actually planted new crops as soon as they could cultivate the land and there was no time left for land to regain its fertility most of the farmers were of the view that due to the extreme limitation of the further expansion of horizontal area and grabbing of cultivable fertile land by ur banization and other activities like highways it has become impossible to keep the land uncultivated even during the period between two major cropping seasons th is continuing practice over the years has lead to major deficiencies in the soil health gill 1993 the issue of crop intensity is important because in order to regain the nutrients of the affected soil ar tificial fertilizers are needed which also add substantia lly to the overall cost of i nputs in agriculture so as the result increase in crop intensity on one hand leads to pressure on soil health on the other hand it puts the economic strain on the farmers 612 farm size due to the increase in pressure of popula tion on land the number of small holdings is increasing as there is no lower limit for land hol dings in punjab and also lower upper limit for large farms land holdings are getting to a scale where the agriculture can become unprofitable these small farms al so generate barely small inco mes and therefore due to low incomes these farmers are not capable to ge nerate internal capital formation which is 69necessary for their growth according to stati scal abstracts of punj ab 1985 the farm size distribution in punjab is given below table8 showing farm si ze distribution in punjab category farm sizeha farms percentage198586 small 2 4263 semimedium 23 1683 medium 34 989 large 4 3065 source stastical abstract of punjab 1985 in order to look at the details in the chosen district s questions were asked from the farmers regarding their ownershi p of farms during the data collec tion enquiries were made about the inheritance of land and the pres ent ownership of land by farmers in the three districts these two aspects of land ownership were considered to get an idea about the changes in the farm size over a span period of one generation below is the pie chart figure 4 showing the inherited farm size acres by the farmers in study area inherited land ownership 44 17 12 27 2 23 34 4 source fieldwork june2004 to compare the changes in farm sizes present land ownership was also recorded and is as below it was found that the farms up to 2 acre comprised 53 percent of the total number of farms in the three districts from where the data was collected the data from the ministry of punjab shows that this percentage has b een increasing from 198081 onwards whereas the 70percentage of large farms is on the decline below is the pi e chart figure 5 showing the present land ownership present land ownership 53 10 11 26 2 23 34 4 source fieldwork june2004 therefore there is necessity not only to check the increase in population dependent on agriculture but also to withdraw population from agri culture by opening up alternatives employment opportunities also liberalization of the land lease market by protecting the interest of land owners could go a long way to increase the fa rm size of small farmers by lending in from medium and large farmers wh o should be willing to do so kalkat 1996 randhawa 1996 a degree of protection in land lease is important for farmers because it gives them the sense of s ecurity about their own land while asked about the reasons for selling their own land 30 percent of th e farmers said that they had to sell their land due to social oblig ations like arranging dowry for girl marriages maintaining status in the societ y another 30 percent of the farm ers pointed to the indebtness beared by them as the main reas on for selling their land they sold land in order to repay their debts or to keep their land as security with rich landlords in order to obtain more loans rest 40 percent of the farmers who sold their land had varied reasons to their action like majority of them used the money collected by sel ling their land to migrate abroad in search of greener pastures 7162 farm machinery in the questionnaire it was tried to get data relating to procession of farm machinery by the farmers data was collected on th e basis of time series to ge t an idea about the nature of changes in the farm equipment questions we re asked about certain implements which are used in the agriculture in punjab this list of equipments was prepared by keeping in mind the level of usage one can get out of them there were certain e quipments which were supposed to be used only on a certain limit of land or on specific crop patterns the data revealed the below tabulated 9 results farmers possessing presently 10 years back tractor 74 44 trolley 62 39 combine 4 1 thresher 16 6 harvester 6 2 seed cum fertilizer drill 23 6 electric motors for irrigation 72 45 diesel motor for irrigation 75 70 cultivators 38 9 source fieldwork june2004 it was found that the farmers presently having tractors were 74 percent as compared to 44 percent about 10 years ago this shows tremendous percent of increase especially when we take into account the decreasing farm size in th e state upon relating the data with the farm size of the respondents it was found that about 60 percent of the farmers who had land below 2 acres possessed a tractor it was bit surprising in order to investigat e the reasons this matter was taken up in group discussion with the farmers it was only then that they revealed some of the reasons the primary reason which was given by farmers was more related to self respect than to agriculture farmers had a notion that it was better to buy their own machin ery rather than to rent it from other big 72farmers they cited that they didnt want to be dependent on other farmers for their equipment these behaviourial characters can be seen as major reason for even small farmers to go in for their own equipments moreover ow ning a tractor has even become as a status symbol so every farmer irrespective of his holdi ng s tries to own a tractor for agriculture as well as for show off similarly the ownership of trolleys has increase d from 39 percent to 69 percent the trolleys are mainly used to carry the produce to the common place of selling mandis according to experts in agricultural university a single tro lley could be actually used by many farmers to bring their produce because even if the crop is ha rvested ta the same time all the farmers cant carry their produce together to mandis due to lack of shelter and space for their produce so investment in trolleys is just not productive unless it is used for other transportation purposes electric motors have increased by 27 percent th is increase is linked with the growth of rice cultivation as it needs more water which is complemented with the installation of these motors it was found that farmers spend a lot of their money in upgrading these motors almost every alternative year more than 77 percent of the farmers reported that they had to deepen the underground motors which pump the water up from surface within the span of every three years below is the pie chart 6 showing the time span in percentage for up gradation of electric motors upgradation of electric motors 77 23 within 3 yrs after 3 yrs source fieldwork june2004 upon investigation it was found that it require d a substantial amount of money and time for this process so this factor also played its part in increasing the investment in the agricultural sector 73although the growth of diesel engines is not high but the farmers claimed them too as a reason for increasing their production costs although electricity for irrigation is comparatively cheaper than using diesel the suppl y of electricity for ag riculture is becoming scarce every year due to more demand than production capability off the power in the state there are not many opportunities to produce either hydropower or thermal electricity due to lack of electricity they have to depend on th ese diesel engines day and night to meet the requirements of water for irrigation secondly pa rtly due to steep increase in the prices of diesel over last years had put much more burden on the farmers as it leads to increase in the input costs increase in percentages of other equipment can be attributed to the use of new cultivation methods in the state 63 production pattern just after independence the count ry was in the grip of severe food shortages in spite of heavy imports of food grains thus the priority of the nation was to lay the more stress on production of cereals the state of punjab took th e lead in making drastic changes in the crop pattern apart from pushing up the productivity of various crops during the fieldwork it was aimed to know about the production pattern in th e three districts and also the possible reasons behind these patterns 631 crop pattern rice which occupied only 604 perc ent of total cultiv ated area in 196061 registered a steep rise up to 5262 percent in 199596statiscal abstracts pf p unjab 1996 in th is section i wanted to know that if there was any relation be tween cultivation of rice wheat pattern to the conditions of the area either physical or any other during the fiel dwork it was found that ricewheat pattern was dominant all over the three districts though out of the three selected districts only ludhiana was actua lly having conditions as favourable soil for rice cultivation however districts of mansa and hosirapur also had almost the same number of farmers who followed this specific kind of crop pattern known th e facts that the soils in mansa district are sandy and not very viable for rice cultivation al so in the district of hosiarpur which is situated in the foothills of himalayas the terr ain is not very favourable for rice cultivation 74in order to get the reas on behind their following of this pa ttern farmers were asked to give reasons for growing their specific crops which was rice and wheat for majority to make it easy for them and to get an even more insight in to the reasons i gave them some options to select and also one thee was an option for them to write any other reason among the choices in the answers were 1 assu red price 2 due to their demand 3 better return 4 easy to grow 5 other reasons below are the results which are interpreted in form of pie chart 7 reasons for growing crops 42 35 11 9 3 assured price due to demand better return easy to grow other reasons source field work june 2004 assured price was the first reason for farmers to adopt wheatrice crop pattern because of the government policy of procurement minimum s upport price is settled and all the produce is bought according to the fixed price farmers feel a sense of security while sowing these crops knowing that they will one day reap into returns second largest percentage was attributed to the reason of demand farmers were of the view that once they grew these crops they were able to sell them fast because the government has the basic infrastructure to procure it easily and fast as compared to other crops better return was the reason for 11 percent of the farmers because they thought that these crops were more attractive in terms of monetary gains 9 percent of the framers were adopting this patt ern due to the easy approach while cultivating them they were of the view that once the rice or wheat is grown they didnt had to care much about the crops until they are ready for ha rvesting but in case of crops like maize they had to actually be on constant vigil against crop damage by animals or by human activity they considered rice wheat pattern as comparat ively risk free the comparative economics of various crops enterprises and the associated risk in production and marke ting are the factors to determine the choice of crops in the production plan the effective price support was given only to paddy and wheat therefore the agri culture in punjab is heading towards 75specialization even th ough serious concerns have been expressed time and again for diversification of agriculture from the above trends which are as the result of questionnaire survey i have been able to analyse the reasons behind much ta lked and critised crop pattern in the state it is often that farmers are blamed for sticking to this pattern but this study re veals that it is not only that farmers adopt this pattern for their easy approach but it is the integr ation of other factors which lead to present cropping mechanism it involves a role played by the government although it requires a study like this to explore that insight view the emerging cropping pattern ha s not only high requirements of underground water diesel power fertilizers and pesticides but has al so disturbed the soil structure by puddling puddling is the practic e of making the soil r eady for paddy cultivation as an effect of paddling the water does not percol ate through the soil and it also affects the soil by changing its natural structure puddling of the soil results in dispersion of soil particles the dispersed clay moves down into the soil and clogging of por es reduces permeability of water this also causes the formation of plow sole hard pan at about 2025 cm depth in the soil when the soil is kept submerged during the growing period of rice the physicalchemical and microbiological environment of the soil are altered singh 1992 rice cultivation increases the bulk intensity modulus of raptur e and dispersion ratio singh 1992 the wheat rice pattern has lead to many ecologi cal changes singh et al 1990 the increase in area under wheat is at the cost of gram and oilseeds while that under rice at the cost of maize groundnut pulses also with intensive cropping the area under leguminous crops has decreased singh 1992 the leguminous crops form ed an important part of cropping system before intensive cropping came in the legumi nous crops are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and are deep rooted t hus they replenish the nutrients to some extend bijay et al 1991 demonstrates that inclusion of a legum e green manure crop in the cropping sequence has improved the potential of soil to sustain high yields in addition to saving nitrogen and taking care of micronut rient deficiencies 64 water resource management and development water is an essential constituent of human animal and plant life it is a renewable natural recourse but there is an upper limit to the av ailability of water in the area determined by annual accruals through infl ows and rainfall huge investments have been made to exploit this resource for sustaining the irrigated farming th e efficient management of water demands that 76the maximum portion of precipita tion receipts are used for ve getation and that the minimum of this goes as seepage run off or merely as evaporation loss the spectacular increase in agricultural producti on in the punjab state has been made possible due to expansion of irrigation network initia lly through canals and thro ugh widespread use of tube wells only 54 percent of the net sown ar ea was irrigated in 196061 which increased to 95 percent in 199596 the area irrigated by tu be wells numbering 088 million is 62 percent and the remaining 38 percent is mainly by can als the area irriga ted by tube wells has increased by nearly three times over that of 196061 statistical ab stract of punjab 1980 1996 the area irrigated by canals varies from year to year which adds to already high degree of uncertainty in agriculture the aim of this section was to know the extend of decline in water table in these three districts and to what extend it was hampering their agri cultural practices the fact that water for irrigation is an important variable was clear when 56 percent of the farmers questioned characterised it as a high constrai nt which is experienced by them the farmers in different districts gave the deta ils of changes in water table the changes in water table were broadly consistent showing sh arp declines within the districts except in ludhiana district where one of the villages su rveyed reported unusual moderate decline possibly due to its proximity to the river sutl uj which passes through close proximity the decline as reported in thr ee districts is as follows table10 districts of study area water level meters approximately 10 yrs ago water level meters presently ludhiana 1015 4555 mansa 510 3040 hosiarpur 1015 4050 source field work june2004 the low figures corresponding to ma nsa district are due to the re ason that this district was probably the last district in the state to switc h over to rice cultivation because until early 90s cotton was the main crop of the district but its cultivation was discouraged by widespread disease 77when asked about the problems asked due to d ecline in water table majority of farmers attributed this reason for th e increase in input costs another discovery was that almost all the farm ers were aware of the declining groundwater problem and it reasons but they pleaded helplessness to change the situation the over exploitation is bound to increase further on account of continuous extension of paddy cultivation on more and more sandy soil as well as because of incr ease of intensity of cropping the over exploitation has mainly been cau sed with the manifold increase in the area under wheat and rice high water requir ing crops particularly and predominantly wheat rice rotation ther efore the prevalen t production pattern doe s not seem to be sustainable in the long run 65 pest management the pest problems in punjab agriculture ha ve undergone a tremendous change due to the adoption of green revolution tec hnology the widesaspread cultivat ion of short statured high yielding varieties increased us e of nitrogeneous fertilizers pesticides and irrigation has accentuated pest problems some of the minor pe st has become major whereas several major pests have become resistant to commonly us ed pesticides singh and dhaliwal 1992a dhaliwal and arora 1993 pesticide usage by farmers surpringly 82 percen t of the farmers have reported insectspests as high constraints in ag riculture and diseases was reported as high constraint s by 83 percent farmers due to the problem of pest there is also a threat to the ecological equilibrium and economic viability of cotton the main cash crop of the southern dist rict of mansa region farmers expressed their inability to grow cotton anymore due to more pest problem for the crop in recent years problem of weeds was al so significant among farmer s of all districts as 71 percent of the farmers considered it as high constraints pesticides are poisonous chemicals and the farm ers lack the knowledge of their proper use during the focus group discussions in the field farmers revealed that they usually purchase pesticides from the commission agents on loan which could lead to agents advising the framers to purchase unrecommended pesticides to promote their sales use them at loser doses or at longer intervals to reduce the cost of application particularly the farmers in the mansa district were affected some ten years ago when major out break of pests affected the 78cultivation of cotton then the major crop of that area the relevant department in the punjab agricultural university attributed that epidemic pest appearance to the large scale cultivation of unreccomended susceptible varieties choice of wrong insecticides and dosages longer spray intervals indiscriminate and excessi ve usage and reduced efficiency of some insecticides whereas in the district of ludhi ana farmers complained about the stem borer problem in rice cultivation a nd majority of them expressed unawareness about the possible reasons however the university officials reported this problem as caused by early transplantation of rice by the farmers surpri ngly the university recommends the planting of rice not before late june or early july but according to the information gathered during the fieldwork it was revealed that more than 80 pe rcent of the farmers had the tendency to start plantation by as early as may early plantation like this does not only cause diseases for crops but it leads to excessive evaporation during the months of may and june much more quant ities of water are needed to compensate evaporation as compared to cultiv ation which is undertaken during the month of july when irrigation is supplemented by monsoon rains 66 agro industrial developments in the pre independence period punjab stat e was economically backward with traditional agriculture the partitio n of the state in 1947 gave a seriou s blow resulting in most of the industrial establishments and ra w material supplying areas left in pakistan the economy was completely shattered due to acute shortage of capital and infrastructure the fear of partition was so deep that every entrepreneur was re luctant to invest in this border state agro industries can play a long part in reduc ing the pressure on land farmers in ludhiana district were of the view that more sugar mills should be build in the district so as to explore the possibilities of sugar production which w ould result in timely procurement of their produce during the fieldwork it wa s found that large scale agro processing facilities in the organised sector are vi rtually non existent presently these perishables are produced primarily for the table purposes and lack the required quality parameters for their processing and preservation the policy for rapi d industrialization has to be ba sed on the indus trial potential of the state during the discussi ons it was felt that farmers were mentally ready for such an approach especially in the district of hosiar pur where farmers expres sed their views in the positive direction majority of th e farmers who once started to explore additional agriculture 79practices like honey bee keeping production of eggs and vegetables were forced to discontinue due to problems faced by them in terms of selling their produce not getting enough returns and insufficient support from the government after the discussions with the farmers in these districts i can say that the development of agro industries can open up wide possibilities for the divers ification of th e agricultural production pattern 67 labour factor as a result of rising demand fo r labour in agriculture industry and trade sectors there has been an influx of population in punjab from other states of india apart from the fast growing developments in farming and non farming sector s in the economy of punjab rice cultivation is the main reason for attracting and absorbing the influx of migrant la bour the migration of labour has made labour supply more elastic with th e result the wage rates in punjab in almost all the sectors have declined and thus lowered the cost of production unfortunately the local labour could not gain proportionate ly out of this proc ess of economic growth as the migrant labour was ready to work at lower wages than the local labour which rendered the migrants more job opportunities than th eir local counterpar ts accompanied with the migrant labour there are certain socio econom ic problems which have been created in the state the objective of studying this aspect regarding the percep tions of local farmers towards migrant labour was to look at the genera l effects on society due to mi grating labour which basically migrates for the purpose of ri ce cultivation in the state picture showing migrant la bour working in rice field 80the migration in the state has lead to development of conf licting scenario among the local labour and the migrant labour indi cations from the fieldwork s uggest that although most of the farmers employ migrant labour but most of th e farmers were quite critical of their role the general reason of employing migrant labour is the increasing trend of disengagement from agriculture by the punjabi youth due to less attractive returns in the profession and their passion to migrate abroad the various perceptions regarding migrant labour were recorded and are presented 67 percent of the farmers blamed migrant labour for increasing use of drugs in the state besides th is factor farmers believed th at thefts murders rapes and kidnappings have increased with the emergence of migrant labour in the district of ludhiana 47 percent of farmers blamed migran t labour for creation of slums 55 percent for transmission of diseases and 58 pe rcent blamed them for traffic hazards in the district while some of the above mentioned perception s are important for environmental concerns around cities but mostly it shows the indirect effect of crop pa ttern labour migrates in the state for cultivation of rice on large scale on the social structure of the state what i interpret from the study is that no doubt that farmer blames the migrant labour from other states for their concerns but at the same time they are much dependant on these migrants due to non availability of local labour it is important to know as to why so much labour is required from outside the state for agricultural purposes it is a common phenomenon in punjab in recent year s that punjabi youth are not very comfortable with the agricultural work questions were included in questionnaire to probe about the labour factor in the state when asked about how many farmers employed migrant labour all year around the answers revealed a certain pattern which relates this aspect to others table 11 district of farmers who employ local labour of farmers who employ migrant labour mansa 92 8 ludhiana 3 97 hosiarpur 25 75 source fieldwork june2004 81from the above table we can see the pattern that is almost opposite within the three districts as mentioned earlier that there ar e no large scale factories in ho siarpur and almost absence of factories in mansa district as the result people were compelled to work in fields as ludhiana is the largest industrial c ity most of the youth pref erred to go to work in factories rather than in fields with an average wage rate it amount ed to the same money which it will take to employ a labourer so the reason behind not worki ng in the fields was o bvious as they linked it to their personal dignity to work in fields along with other migr ant labour city culture could also have been responsible for its impact on the rural changes when the farmers were asked about the factors whic h lead to their selection of labour for their fields it was again a different pattern in the answers in mansa district farmers who employ migratory labour choose laziness of local labour as a primary reason for not employing local la bour and also they felt encouraged by comparatively cheap migrant labour in ludhiana district 79 percent farmers said th at they didnt employed local labour because they discontinued themselves local labour themselves dont tu rn up for work 18 percent farmers said expensive as th e reason for not employing local labour and shortage of local labour as the reason for choosing migrant labour in hosiarpur district 55 percent farmers were of the view that the local labour discontinued themselves and also the ability of migrator y labour to work for more hours as the main reasons for employing migrant labour an interesting factor which came out in the group discussions was that majority of the local labour was voluntarily unemployed in the fields as they did not like to be employed as farm labour because of the dignity factor and prefer red instead to move to nearby cities and work as industrial labours 68 land and social constraints the density of population in th e state is 403 persons per km 2 refer to url6 on page 110 which means high population pressure as the depe ndence on agriculture is very high and the possibility of land expansion is negligible ke eping in mind that alr eady area under cultivation is reaching its limit there is even more land co nstraint in the state l eading to sub division of holdings and thus decreasing the average size of farm 82rate of industrialization has been low and is not making perceptible dent in decreasing pressure of population depending directly a nd indirectly on agriculture besides land constraints there are several social constraint s which punjab is facing now like the attitudinal changes among the farmers during the survey 60 percent of the farmers said that individualism has increased among the farmer s over last 10 years this aspect becomes important because it is linked with the culture of working together in a family or with relatives it appears that with the onset of globalization farmers in punjab have also become more concerned about their individual acts as farmers reported that the days were gone when family members used to work together in the fields and supported each other working together in coherence with the family saves a lot of money because some of the labour and domestic needs are meet by the fa mily members within themselves 86 percent of the farmers said that the depe ndence on labour has increased substantially over last years even in non agricultural domestic se ttings the domestic settings here include the labour work needed within the hous e like taking care of cattle et c this change is responsible for increasing the cost of livin g and therefore resulting in ec onomic burden on the farmers over dependence on labour and the advent of st atus building within their community often leads to extra expenditure the changes in lifes tyle which demand a certain level of standard to be maintained in the society irrespective of the income contributes to over spending in majority of the cases farmers either sell their la nd or go in for loans and eventually end up in the viscous circle of debts other constraints in order to know about the fa rmers perception about the c onstraints they meet in the agriculture profession se veral elements both biotic and abio tic were listed and farmers were asked to express their level regarding these elements among abiotic constraints farmers expressed te mperature rainfall marketing and water for irrigation as the high co nstraints in agriculture presently farm ers were of the view that rising temperatures and untimely rainfall were among th e high constraints for th e crops it should be noted that rainfall still plays an important part in agriculture of punjab even though majority of the area is irrigated by eith er underground water and canal sy stem because firstly it is responsible for replenishment of under ground water and sec ondly the time of rainfall is important as the rain which coincides with the transplanting of paddy crop can actually 83substitute a lot of water which was otherwise to be supplied by tubewells marketing of their produce was also high on the constraint level among majority of farmers farmers who opted to diversify their crops with the addition of pulses sunflower and sugarcane were highly critical of the marketing system because they sa id that they had to face many difficulties while selling their produce there was no central agen cy assigned for the purc hase of these crops and the farmers had to wait as long as two years to get their rebruisment money in case of sugarcane from the government water for irriga tion was also on the high constraints list particularly due to declining wate r level across these districts transportation storage credit availability were expressed as moderate constraints transportation was particularly im portant in case of farmers from hosiarpur district who grew some fruits and vegetables but due to lack of transportation facili ties they could not be transported quickly enough to other demand areas wh ich results in spoiling of these perishable produce storage can be divided into two categori es firstly there is a problem due to lack of cold storages in the three distri cts due to which perishable pr oducts cant be stored for long time with the help of cold storages these produc ts can be made availabl e for exports and also for internal use in the state for much longer time the other category of storage is the normal selling place called mandi it is this pla ce where farmers bring their produce and wait for government agencies to come and buy it from th em often the problem is that these places are not well managed they lack good roofs and enough space for farmers to lay their produce in the busy harvesting season which leads to expos ure of their produce to rain and adverse weather which as the result re duces the quality of the lying produce and hence affects the payment by the agencies picture above shows farmers trying to drain wa ter from mandi in orde r to protect the crop 84credit availability was considered as the mode rate constraint by the farmers more or less government had launched many schemes recently like the kisan credit card which offers farmer easy and spontaneous loan agreements farm ers in the selected districts seemed to be satisfied with the credit availability seed quality fertilizer quality plant protection mate rial were considered as low constraints by the surveyed farmers farmers were particularly satisfied with the seed quality they also expressed negligible problems while getting plan t protection material and also approved the quality of fertilizers according to their needs this part of the survey revealed that mark eting and storage needs to be improved by government but farmers largely seemed to be satis fied with the seed re search mainly done by punjab agricultural university the above menti oned constraints which include both biotic and abiotic elements effect the farmers decision to go in for a particular type of crop pattern and these constraints are also respons ible indirectly for contributi ng to agricultural stagnation as these elements discoura ge crop diversification livestock is an important aspect of rural activi ties and play an important role in helping the agricultural economy it was found that only 43 percent of the households had actually cows and 90 percent of the households have buffalos only 17 percent of the households reported to be using the animals for dairy farming which is quite low with respec t to the possibilities in the state actually dairy farming can go a long way in contributing income to the household the economic and the social constraints discussed in this chapter often put punjabi farmers in limelight regarding committing suicides when farmers were asked about suicide perception 65 percent of the farmers felt that economic reasons were to be blamed from the findings of the chapter we can conclu de that agriculture sta gnation can not be seen as an independent term but it is a complex interrelationship between agricultural practices ecological factors societal beha viour and the government policy 8569 summary agricultural development plans of the state la id a greater stress on increasing agricultural production and achieving high growth rate due c onsideration has not been given to maintain the ecological balance wheat and rice pattern has dominated through out partly because of constraints of resources and technical manpower as the result other competitive crops lagged behind the shift in production pattern toward s dominantly monoculture of wheat rice rotation supported by high yielding varities irrigation market in frastructure and price support took place the wheat rice rotation became more profitable and generally less risky compared to other crops this change in producti on pattern though was mainly res ponsible for achieving stellar growth but this pursuit of monoculture overtime has resu lted in manifestation of several adverse effects on environment and ecological ba lance like the water level is dropping soil is getting degraded soil texture and structure has been adversely affe cted by puddling of land and rapid mechanization is polluting air and burning of paddy straw and wheat and paddy stubbles is becoming an increasing problem actually all the constraints discussed in this chapter are largely the causes of agricultural stagnation in punjab this chap ter also nullifies the common con cept in the state that farmers are responsible for agricultural stagnation because this study establishes that farmers are ready for agricultural diversification but need an impetus push from the government through the launch of proper schemes with proper mark eting facilities and storage capacities the next chapter deals with the role of the ma jor institutions in punjab namely the punjab agricultural university and the department of agriculture punjab government 86chapter seven role of major institutions 70 introduction agricultural and extension education programs a nd institutions play an important role in determining the economic output of the agricu ltural sector and its development these institutions run various extens ion programs which are directed toward meeting the needs of farmers and farming societal changes ar e opening new arenas for people oriented information and education these institutions helps people improve their lives through an educational process that uses sc ientific knowledge focused on issues and needs in this part of the study i have tried to review th e role of major agricultural or ganisations in the state namely the punjab agricultural university and the de partment of agriculture punjab government 71 punjab agricultural university punjab agricultural university p au is the major university of agricultural research in punjab established in 1962 in the central distri ct of ludhiana the university has become an important centre of agricultural research and edu cation in the state the university covers an area of 1510 acres on its main campus and 4615 ac res at the regional res earch stations making it possible for pau to perform the integrated f unctions of teaching rese arch and extension in agriculture agricultural engineer ing veterinary and animal sc iences home since and allied disciplines refer to url7 on page 110 the pau has played a key role in increasing food grain production in the punjab state several folds sh are its reputation and ushering in an era of green revolution in india the research wing of the university has been at the forefront of innovations in knowledge based technology generation and its dissemination it has played an important role in making the state of punjab the wheat and rice bowl of the country incr ease in agricultural production and self sufficiency in food gr ain production in punjab was ma de possible as a result of combination between generation and adopti on of agricultural technologies research strategies in pau have been reoriented from tim e to time earlier the university spearheaded the green revolution in the region fine tuning and disseminating technologies for increasing 87agriculture production through management of the semi dwarf wheats and rices the initial successes were followed up with better and refi ned technologies rele ase of high yielding varieties like the wheat post green revolution period witnessed a progressive increase in intensification of agriculture which resulted in ever increasing constraints to increasing productivity the research and the production capabilities of the university have lead to building a bridge between farming and farmers of the state farm ers not only form the re ceiving end of this bridge adopting of new varieties and technologies but they also prove to be an asset by providing feedback to the research scientists for further up gradation of technologies besides crop improvement and breeding the major thru st areas of university includes crop management technology water management soil and nutrient management weed management post harvest management disease management according to agricultural experts pau has b een instrumental in developing appropriate engineering technologies tech niques for crop production post harvest operations soil and water management and utilization of renewabl e energy sources for agriculture these efforts have helped in making punjab a front runner in agricultu ral mechanization it also provides strong support for understanding an d developing basic practices in agricultural and livestock agricultural university also play s an important role in forming various agricultural policies at state and national level by estimating the cost of cultivation of various crops which proves very useful in deciding minimum suppor t price msp for different crops the extension service of punjab agricultural university played vital role in ushering the green revolution in the state as this is the wi ng which actually interacts with the farmers directorate of extension education is responsib le for running specialized training courses for the benefit of the farmers and development staff at the university head quarter as well as at krishi vigyan kendra kvks these kvks are extension offices of th e university in other districts where farmers are given advice and other agricultural hel p it also organises workshops farmers fairs three months young farmers training courses correspondence courses for farmers and farm women krishi vigyan kendras have been set in the punjab state for imparting specialised training to the farmers by experts in the field of agriculture presently there are scattered in 10 districts of the state but un fortunately none was situated in any of the three district covered under this study this was infact one of the major reasons for 88farmers in these districts particularly in cas e of hosiarpur and mansa where farmers tend to take advice from pesticide dealers as agricultur al staff is not accessible in these districts due to lack of kvks this tendenc y was less prevalent in ludhiana district where farmers had the access to pau according to one of the university officials who were interviewed research endeavours of the university have been reoriented to gene rate technologies for increasing productivity introducing resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses in crops improving quality of the produce increasing profitability and sustainability in ag ricultural production syst ems efficient use of inputs and conservation of natural resources agro ecosystem and improvement of quality of life in rural areas are some of the current thrust areas keeping with the present trends pau is currently developing cost effective technologies with emphasis on better relationship between crop produc tivity profitabili ty and sustainability of natural resources including soil water environment and other inputs are receiving greater focus research on export oriented production of wheat rice and other crops including horticultural medicinal aromatic and spice crops for diversifi cation of rice wheat cropping system is also being intensified developing integrated soil health and nutrient management systems for sustainable crop productivity and efficient management pf input s use of organic manures green manures and bio fertilizers also form important areas of present rese arch studies for improving water use efficiency in different crops and cropping sy stems and suggesting timely crop management practices are being undertaken the current res earch in farm mechanization include paddy production mechanization paddy transplanting and residue management cotton production mechanization cotton planter sprayer and pickers and horticulture mechanization vegetable transplanters weeders and sprayers the current research can go a long way in re ducing the practice of paddy straw burning by providing better alternatives of its disposal to the farmers upon contacting the water department of the uni versity it was learnt that technologies techniques for recharging of ground water remediation of sewerage water for irrigation water balance studies and developing of su itable water harvesting technologies in sub mountainous regions like hosiarpur were receiving due emphasis in the department 89efforts are on to develop machinery like crop dr yers gasifiers for indu stry rice straw husk based gasifiers etc research on socio economic aspects is focused on studying the economics and marketing of various crops and impact of information technology on the socio economic status of punjab farmers besides the ongoing re search activities uni versity also arranges some interaction opportunities for farmers kisan melas where farmers come in large numbers and are shown the latest crop varieties and farm machinery apart from the sale of seeds technical guidance question answer sessions demonstrations of fiel d crops animals feeds and their fodders are undertaken these kisan melas are generally held twice a year at the selected regional centres across the state from the above mentioned role played by the univ ersity it can be said th at the university has been playing a determinantal role in the farming scenario of the state since its establishment about 43 years ago and continues to play so by its research and extension services to the farming community farmers perception about punjab agricultural university was on one the main issues in the course of this study in order to accomplish this information re levant questions were included in the questionnaire and also in the group disc ussions as it is clear that the agricultural university holds an important place in the agricu lture system of the state so it was quite necessary to know farmers percep tion about this institute in the survey it was found a mi xed response to the question that how farmers did perceived the role of the university in the development of agriculture in the state on compiling the answers an interesting trend ha s emerged which shows that while majority of the farmers in the district of ludhiana said that the univers ity meant a lot for them as a support for their profession they seemed to be highly satisf ied with the services of the university the appreciation came particularly for the kisan mela s which are organised by university to give knowledge about new varieties and technology they added that th ey often participate in the farmer helping camps organised by the universit y majority of the farmers actually followed the instructions and suggestions given by th e university generally they applauded the working of the university 90the farmers in the districts of mansa and hosiarpur had a differe nt reaction the same question in these districts it was almost opposite reaction here majority of the farmers said that they dont perceive the university as any helpful institution for them farmers reported that they seldom visit the university for any functions or seminars re lating to agriculture even surprisingly many of the farmers had inf act never been to university or one of its extension offices they also repl ied in negative when asked that if any university official had ever visited their area the most probable reason for this divisive answer lies in the fact that there are no university extension offices or kvk in these two districts whereas the university itself is situated in ludhiana the locational advantag e to the farmers of ludhiana is not available for the farmers of the other two districts this trend of responses leads this chap ter to conclude that even after more than 40 years of its establishment the ag ricultural university has not been ale to reach all the corners of the state another question which was incl uded in the questionnaire was with whom farmers discussed their agricultural problems th e objective to include this ques tion was to see that who was most influencing the farmers and their decisions as far as agriculture was concerned out of the farmers who responded positively to the que stion about 18 percent actually discussed their agricultural problems with either univ ersity or kvk or an y of the university representatives the biggest share of advising was taken by the private pesticide dealers as 36 percent of the farmers replied that they approa ched these dealers for any kind of agricultural related advice this result itself determines the level of impact the university has on the farmers of the state upon contacting the university officials to take th eir view on the situatio n they cited the lack of funds as the primary reason for not being able to establish at least one kvk in each district of the state they also pleaded the lack of extension staff fo r the not reaching the farmers 72 department of agriculture punjab government the department of agriculture and cooperation is responsible for the formulation and implementation of national polic ies and programmes aimed at achieving rapid agricultural growth through optimum utilizatio n of the countrys land wate r soil and plant resources 91the department is responsible for undertaking all measures to ensure timely and adequate supply of inputs and services such as fertilizer s seeds pesticides and agricultural implements it also provides agricultural credit crops insu rance and ensures remunerative returns to the farmer for his agricultural produce the department is entrusted with the responsib ility of collection and maintenance of a wide range of statistical and economic data relati ng to agriculture required for development planning organising agricultural census assist ing and advising the states in undertaking scarcity relief measures and in management of natural calamities eg flood drought cyclone etc matters relating to formulation of overall cooperative policy in the country national cooperative organisations cooperati ve training and education co me under the preview of the department the department also participates in activities of international organizations for fostering bilateral cooperation in agricultural and allie d sectors and for promotion of export in agricultural commodities the important part of the agri cultural system in the governm ent is the agricultural price policy which aims at ensuring remunerative pr ices to the growers fo r their produce with a view to encourage higher production toward s the end minimum support prices for major agricultural products are announced each year which are fixed according to the production costs of the current year food corporation of india fci is the major procuring agency for the government fci is responsible for the procurement of all the crops grown by the framers but main emphasis is always on the procuremen t of rice and wheat th e reason may be their easy storage and demand for internal cons umption and export outside the country farmers perception about the agricultural departme nt is very important in order to understand the reasons behind the success or failure of govern ment policies when farmers were asked as to how did they perceived governments policy fo r agricultural development there were a lot of answers covering wide aspects but it was seen that big farmers were generally seem to be satisfied with the governments policies while sm all or medium farmers were often recorded complaining major points on which the farmers critised the government policy on agriculture were ranging from that the government was providing less su bsidies on fertilizers and pesticides majority 92of the farmers wanted the minimum support price of all crops to be increased many demanded that government should help poor fa rmers with inputs for agriculture they advocated distribution of loans with zero percent interest for agriculture better fertilizers and more awareness camps were also among the requirements but above all these responses one answer wh ich was most common was the requirement of better marketing facilities most of the farmers seemed to be unhappy with the governments effort of marketing farmers complained that it was extremely difficult for them to sell the crops other than rice and wheat it was seen th at the farmers who tried to diversify to other crops were more depressed becaus e they could not sell their produ ce so as the result they had to again return to their usual cropping cycle of wheat and rice many farmers unfolded their stories when they had to wait for weeks in order to sell their produce and often even months to clear their payment dues all these factors discouraged them to switch over to other crops than traditional relatively ea sier to sell crops lack of infrastructure was also one of the main points which constituted the lack of well maintained mandis selling places especially in the district of hosiarpur farmers complained about the lack of storage facilities in the district which prevente d them for growing fruits and vegetables generally farmers we re not satisfied with the governments agricultural policy as they felt that the policy doesnt hold anyt hing substantial for them in their future interaction with the agricultural departments st aff can be analysed from the fact that only 13 percent of the farmers discussed their agricult ural related problems with them even more serious were the results when only 2 percen t of the farmers contacted animal husbandry department to meet their lives tock requirements the positive figures for the government were gathered when farmers were asked about thei r membership any of the organisation at the village level 51 percent of the farmers were found to be attached with cooperative organizations these co operative organizations are formed to work at the ground level they are indulged in milk collection from the villages and sometimes other products like honey also although with minor success largely it can be said that mostly farmers felt isolated from the governments policy on agriculture and wanted major changes in order to address their problems 9373 summary its beyond doubt that punjab agricultural unive rsity has played an important role in the development of agriculture in the state it is responsible for creating awareness and dissemination of technology both genetic and phys ical however during the course of the fieldwork it was found out that despite the clai ms of the university the truth remains that even after 40 years of its establishment pau has not been able to reach the farmers particularly in the districts wh ere there are still no kvks farmer s prefer to approach private pesticide dealers in order to get their problems addressed none different was the farmers attitude towards the agricultural policy of the go vernment but with the help of this chapter an important link has been formed between the la cks of participation in diversification and the farmers approach towards diversification this ch apter has been able to falsify the claim of the government that farmers were responsible for not diversifying agriculture because what this study found is that farmers are often ready for diversification and infact many had even given it a try but the problem of marketing their produce had di scouraged them to give it a second thought the co operative organizations were found to be working exceptionally well in these districts this chapter forms an integr al part of the study by an alysing the integration between agricultural institutions and the farmers the next and the last chapter of the study deals with summing up of all the results and conclusion with recommendations 94chapter eight summary and conclusion 80 introduction after the spectacular grow th rate during the sixties and th e seventies the punjab economy began to slow down in the late 1980s and decelerated further during the 1990s its per capita income grew at an annual average rate of 21 percent during the 1990s significantly below the national average and the thir d lowest rate among major indian states punjab development report 2004 the main issue concerned in this study concerned causes a nd effects related to the stagnation of agriculture th e study takes its depart ure from the fact that there is growing evidence of agricultura l stagnation attributable to govern ment policies and specific land use activities of the local framers however ther e is strong emergence that the prevalence of certain government policies has led to a time wher e present day punjab stands in crossroads the main objective of the study was to explore th e presence of stagnati on and further look at the basic reasons leading to the problem and the possible fallouts both ecological and social the research approach adopted has examined the present land use patterns in the study area and assessed their problems conflicts and ch allenges in the land use system in the three districts of punjab state cha nging scenario of punjab agriculture discuss the pre and the post green revolution era with special emphasis on ecological and social changes and the relation between these perspectives and the issue of stagnation the final chapter summarises the issues raised and the major findings of the study however it will include the major emphasis on future perspectives and recommendations as th is part responds to one of the objectives of the study conducted however before summarising the findings a nd giving recommendations a few comments on the sensitive issue of stagnation in the state the notion of stagnation in agriculture in the context of punjab state as indicated in the beginning of the study is not clearly fixed the definition of the stagnation in this study can depend upon the attitudes and aspi rations of the society particul arly farmers its perceptions and knowledge of environment and the assembla ges of organisational skills the application of principles of agricultural management is a growing aspect in modern farming the notion of management of using various techniques to reach defined objectives is quite relevant for 95agricultural sector beca use in a state like punjab major ity of people depend upon agriculture and thus relating to natureresour se management in agriculture should be applied to decisions involving natural resources it is closely associ ated for example with resources like water which may be common property component of the environment similarly the whole agricultural environment can be viewed as a complex interacting syst em of many resources and activities thats individual and combined functioning must be first understood before problems and opportunities can be identified and desirable realistic objectives set it is proper that priority attention is given to agriculture in terms of resource management according to punjab development report by wo rld bank the likely la nd use pattern in the coming years suggest that an agricultural use of same kind will continue to be pre dominant in the state this means that majority of land use pattern in agriculture will continue with the current practices this will lead to implications for lands under forest cover for biodiversity and environmental degradation in general envi ronmental degradation particularly leading to lowering of ground water table and depressing farming community are the reasons that this study focuses on stagnation and agriculture syst ems of farmers inte raction with their environment 81 summary findings and discussions of this study have indicated that consid erable attention has not been paid to understand the inter rela tionship of human activity and na tural recourse use in punjab much of the debate has been concerned implicit ly or explicitly with resource overuse and misuse the present study portrays society natu re relationship in terms of stagnation in agriculture during the course of the study it was identified that actually environmental degradation is due to the lack of synchrony between practices of the farmers and the role of institutions in the state the study has also identified that increasing the level of knowledge and potential among the framers of the state can go a long way in e ffective interaction and harmony with nature farmers have be shown to be aware of proble ms to some extend but they express their inability to change the order of the things without the external support of the institutions due to the complex scenario of policies with regard to procurement and pricing of the crops 96majority of the farmers had expressed thei r view in negative when enquired about the profitability in agricultu re but this study leads to the conclu sion that the situation is complex and there is no one factor to be blamed for st agnation this study finds a sense of insecurity among the poor farmers regardi ng the future of agriculture this study concludes that there is declining in pr osperity in agriculture in spite of increase in prices of agricultural products the input prices are also going up with almost same pace the crop productivity on the other hand has stabilise d resulting in slower increase in monetary returns the cost of living is also increasing be cause of the fast increase in general price index and as the effect of globalizati on the priorities have also changed which often leads to more expensive lifestyle in order to keep pace with the consumption trends in society the farmers have to spend beyond their capacity for which they either to go into dept or to dispose of their assets particularly land as a consequence of d ecline in profitability in agriculture the rental value of land has gone down causing further decline in income the conclusion can be summed up in a flowchart showing all the major factors of agricultural stagnation and their relati on to each other on the base of the flowchart we start with three major actors involved in this research farmer s punjab agricultural university and the government the role of the government is characterised by poor management which has constituents of lack of marketing for sugarc ane cotton etc and poor storage facilities for perishable crops and fruits another character of government is lack of proper policy which is mainly faulty due to lack of any thrust for agricultural diversification lack of incentives attractive procurement arrangements both poor ma nagement and lack of proper policy lead to continuance of wheat and rice cultivation in th e state which leads to adverse effects on the health of environment in punj ab as discussed in the study punjab agricultural universitys role has been analysed and th is study has found that there is clear gap between its presence and farmers it has not been able to reach at the grass root levels through its extension services which lead to farmers being unaware of new ecologically efficient mechanisms in agriculture the absence of university officials or agriculture centres in selected places does not allow the dissem ination of knowledge it is often that the development of knowledge is contained within the departments this unawareness leads to pursuing of methods which are re sponsible for ecological damage 97the third actor in the study is found to be farmers whose skills resources influence the pattern of agriculture it wa s found that inadequate lack of knowledge among farmers for agricultural practices lead to specific land us e practices these practices include intense cropping leaving little or no room for land to re juvenate the practice is of burning of paddy straw is another result of faulty land use pr actices these specific lands use practices when added to the shortcomings of the university and the dominance of wh eatrice pattern in agriculture adversely ef fects the environment which include s decline in groundwater table and excessive use of fertilizers once the ecological damage like the decline in water table are done then it requires large sums of money to upgrade the tube wells and the boring machines in order to extract the water gain from the ground which goes below each year so the ecologi cal damage leads to increase in general operations of agriculture other factors which add to increase in general expenditure includes the major characteristic of specific land use practice ie the over investment in agriculture in forms of tract ors and other implements which are often bought and as the result a lot of investment is made which could had been avoided by renting that machinery this tendency specially implies to fa rmers who belong to low and middle farmer groups other behavioural factors like tendency to maintain hi gh lifestyle and overdependence on labour also lead to increase in general expe nditure in the families when the expenditure due to above said practices exceeds the income of the farmer he often goes either to borrow loans or to sell some part of hi s property land in this case often selling of land or getting loans lead them to a trap or a vicious circle from where it becomes extremely difficult to come out once they are poor they sell more land or opt for another loan to repay the ear lier one and so on once the si tuation becomes uncontrollable farmers even go in for suicides so this is how this research study has been able to link the different factors in agriculture which leads to stagnation of economy and agriculture as well based on the explanation above a flowchart below tries to explai n the chain of stagnation in agriculture with the role of con cerned factors at different stages 98 9982 implications for policy making and implementation the urgency to reform and the hectic pace of policy making unfortunately appears to be fading away the primary cause of reform slow down appears to be political this section deals with the agricultu ral strategy and planning as discussed earlier that the agricultural development with focus on agricultural production has lead to ignoring of ecological balance and social scene in the state to deal with the current situation an agricultural strategy to concentrate on important ar eas for research to alleviate or eliminate these adverse effects for attaining sustainable development are identified as below development of sound land use system based on soil capabilities water budgeting in relation to planting pe riod soil type and water availability development of management practices for us e of marginal and poor quality irrigation water on long term basis long term impact of wheat rice syst em on physical chemical and biological properties of the soil monitoring excessive use of agrochemi cals in relation to ecology and economy integrated pest management system s for minimising pesticide problems preservation of agro biodiversity in cluding an appropriate legislation it seems that the prolonged dominant monoculture of wheat rice rotation has now resulted in deceleration of agricultural growth as well as productivity per ha fatigue in technology may be another reason for this phenomenon as no majo r break through in the improvement of rice and wheat varieties has occurred since the gree n revolution it is worrisome and the necessity for diversification for production pattern has time and again been emphasized for the decade or so development of high value products namely fru its vegetables horticulture and floriculture offer good opportunities but adequate agro proces sing facilities ma rketing structure and other infrastructure are required to be build up to render them successful in brief at present a strong political will proper guidance by agricultural institutions and equally remunerative alternatives should be ma de available to substitute area under wheat and rice in the state 100 83 future perspectives with the implementation of wto agreement there are good prospects of export for wheat and rice from developing countries which can generate surpluses and their prices are likely to increase in the international ma rket in future thus punjab has good prospects for exports for wheat and rice but at the same time the mo noculture is creating a difficult ecological imbalance and underground water s hortagesit seem as an paradox a three prolonged strategy may be required to deal with the ecological and other problems created by monoculture of wheat and rice rotation searching solutions within the prevalen t production pattern eg reducing water requirement of rice by avoiding early sowing and decreasing the use of standing water replaced by wetting recharging the ground water more judicious use of insectides and weedicides expanding the integrated peat ma nagement practices promoting balanced use of fertilizers etc is esse ntial to find adequate solutions evolving equally or more remunerative alte rnatives to wheat rice rotation it may be done by putting emphasis on bio technology res earch for evolving improved varieties of crops which offer good substitutes a medium and long term development plan taking into account the potentialities of modern technologies should be formulated covering relevant as pects of ecological agriculture towards sustainabl e development which conserve s water plant and genetic resources is environmentally non degradi ng technically appr opriate economically viable and socially acceptable such a plan should also include appropriate policies programmes and projects to implement it 84 salient recommendations the punjab agriculture is at the crossroads and if the remedial steps ar e not taken it may lead to serious outcomes this part of the study will deal with some of th e measures which can go a long way in easing the s ituation in the state the salient recommendations of this study are 101 there are viable options to improve factor productivity in agriculture which requires massive public support and infrastructure ther e is considerable scope to harness the potential by diversifyi ng to dairy vegetables fruits fi shery and subsidiary enterprises like poultry mushroom produc tion bee keeping etc th is requires massive public support for building up matching infrastructu re for marketing and continuous farmer training for adoption of new ventures esta blishment of dairy units and government support for animal health there is also an urgent need to reduce pressure on land through industrialization an intensive survey of rural i ndustrialization develo pment which could create substantial job opportunities every year in rural ar eas coupled with appropriate steps for developing relevant skills through vocatio nal training should be taken up functional townships in selected rural areas need to be established where all modern facilities of roads water power telecommunication healt h education etc are made available the industry in rural areas should be provided incentives by way of tax exemptions investment in agro processi ng storage market information market development rural roads etc needs to be stepped up in a big way the potential pockets for specialization in high value enterprises should be identified and in the selected areas the matching technical guidance for entrepreneurial development the specific infrastructure support and the related market development should be developed as an integrated system the agricultural credit delivery system exte nsion advisory system and quality input delivery system especially for small and marginal farmers should be strengthened to meet the challenges and to harness the emerging opportunitie s the agricultural research system should be adequately funded sustainability of current st rategy is doubtful so future strategy should include achieving higher productivity of crops soils and livestock identifying efforts to alleviate problem s associated with rice wheat system 102providing knowledge about optimi ze use of fertilizers agroch emicals irrigation water and other inputs requirements for implementation of future programmes as the above mentioned diversification activ ities are highly capital intensive and risky enterprises arrangements for adequate liberal and timely credit faci lities have to made especially for small and medium farmers infrastructural and institutional support is crucial because the major problem of these perishables has to be overcome by enhanci ng the shelf life and prolonging the marketing period of these crops and absorbing the market gluts through market stabilizing programmes the proposed diversification op tions require modern infras tructure and market support through public and private investment in terms of facilities like credit efficient chains from producer to consumers including long distance refrigerated transport value addition by processing and proper marketing of these commod ities in target mark ets technical support and training facilities for these enterprises wh ich require high degree of skill and knowledge are presently inadequate and require adjustment s to suit the requirements of diversification options roads and transport needs to be satisfactory in order for the movement of food grains produced however due to the perishable nature of fruits and vegetables it is important to develop better roads for the rapid movement of farm produce facilities for refrigerated transport which are essential for the proposed ve ntures need to be drastically modernized the present marketing infrastructure and instit utional arrangement in terms of stabilized prices and assured markets are quite effec tive for wheat and rice crops the marketing network for fruits and vegetables is grossly inadequate the prices of these commodities are volatile and the assured marketi ng is lacking assured marketing and appropriate pricing are most critical support systems for the success of the proposed ventures storage facilities are basically designed for storing wheat and rice whereas for fruits and vegetables we need multi purpose storage syst ems well equipped with c ooling facilities thus major effort is required from government sector and private sector to provide this critical infrastructure this may also help in stabiliz ing the prices of these perishables commodities large scale agro processing facilities in the organised sector are no n existent presently theses perishables are produced primarily for the table purposes and lack the required quality 103parameters for their processing and preservati on two essential pre requites for promoting these ventures are development of varietie s suitable for processing assured bulk supplies of these commodities this will necessitate attaining high yields at lower costs and meeting the quality standards in the markets besides the above said recomme ndations below are some of the steps which can also help to ease the situation it has been found that rice plan ted in june leads to saving of 25 35 percent in water over may planting narang a nd gulati 1995 therefore a vigor ous water management education programme should be launched to educate the farm ers of harmful impact of early planting of rice and if needed special legisl ative measures may also be ta ken to regulate the planting of rice in the state it has been estimated that about 60 percent of irrigation water is lost in form of seepage losses sondhi and khepar 1995 th erefore lining of canals wate r courses and field canals use of underground pipe line for conveyance of irrigation water and adaptation of modern means of irrigation such as sprinkler irrigati on and drip irrigation should be practiced there is thus an urgent need to educate the farmers planners administrators and above all politicians to bring awareness of the current status of the use of this primary natural resource and to develop conservative water use culture and to bring in conscious mass awakening for abandoning counter productive wastef ul water use practices in so me cases like early planting of paddy during high evaporation summer m onths overdrawing of tube well waters there is an urgent need to make proper use of huge biomass which is burnt as such rice husk and other crop residues can be processed in proper form rather than transforming them into gases which are harmful for human plant and animal health burning in the field is also harmful for the soil microbial ac tivity the abundant availability of crop residues potential forestry and grasses in the semi hilly tracts can be used to produce card board paper and plywood to be successful however attention will have to be paid to a number of aspects of contract farming eg selection of crops development of quick and efficient contract enforcement and dispute resolution system and developing frame rs s organisations capable of contracting with sponsors with a view to reducing transaction costs in creasing information flow and improving farmers negotiating position 104until reform is put on the top of the political agenda by all parties with the support of key elements of civil society the situation in punj ab is likely to continue its downward spiral 85 concluding remarks the economic social and ecological changes th at manifests themselves with the framing community of punjab whether caused by par ticular land practices or by approaches and policies promoted by the state and its institutions are crucial for both framers and nature and the effects are clearly noticeable in terms of stagnation in all forms the alternative management for the prevalent cris es should be an outco me of ideological trends reflecting the needs and aspirations of farmers in whose interests programmes can be implemented so that their effective participation can be secure d these involve increased reorganisation of resource management practices analysis of the value of such prac tices under current and future conditions assessment of the ways to adopt sustainable practices and modern agricultural planning approaches empowering farmers groups and communities to take greater responsibility fo r the long term management of thei r resources and securing a better and promising future the issues taken up in the study serve to direct attention to a number of important causes leading to stagnation in agriculture and provide possibilities for sustainable agriculture management in this northern indian state of punjab it is the conviction of this study that positive potentials of the farmers can be harnessed for sustainable growth in economic social and ecological se ctors of agriculture community 105reference list agarwal bina women and water resource development mimeo institute of economic growth delhi 1981
