111 agriculture sector in india rural indian women are extensively involved in agricultural activities however the nature and extent of their involvement differs with the variations in agroproduction systems the mode of femaleparticipation in agricultural production varies with the landowning status of farm households their roles range from managers to landless labourers in over all farm production womens average contribution is estimated at 55 to 66 of the total labour with percentages much higher in certain regions inthe indian himalayas a pair of bullocks works 1064 hours a man 1212 hours and a woman 3485 hours in a year on a once hectare farm a figure that illustrates womens significant contribution to agricultural production shiva fao 1991 the impact of wto rules and policies of trade liberalization in the agriculture sector on women is distinctive for four reasons firstly women have been the primary seed keepers processors they have been the both experts and producers of food from seed to the kitchen wt o impacts womens expertise and productive functions throughout the food chain the trade related intellectual propertyrights trips agreement impacts womens knowledge of and control over seed the agreement on agriculture impacts womens livelihood and income security and also has secondary impacts in terms of increased violence against women the sanitary and phyto sanitary agreement has a direct impacton womens expertise and economic role in agroprocessing secondly as globalization shifts agriculture to capital intensive chemical intensive systems women bear disproportionate cots of both displacement and health hazards thirdly women carry the heavier work burden in food production and because of gender discrimination get lower returns for their work when wto destroys rural livelihoods it is women wholoose the most when wto rules allow dumping which leads to decline in prices of farm products it is womens already low incomes which go down further fourthly their position visvis wto is also more vulnerable because as the livelihoods and incomes of farmers in general and women agriculturists in particular are eroded they are displacedfrom productive roles women in agriculture and their status is further devalued while the patriarchal power of those who control assets and benefit from asset transfer due to globalisation is increased other social processes are triggered which result in increased violence against women the violence associated with displacement devaluation and disempowerment takes the form of intensive violence increasing incidences of rape the epidemic of female foeticide and growth in2trafficking of women women also bear the ultimate burden of farm suicides since they are left to look after their households without assets but with the burden of indebtedness india has a geographical area of 32873 million hectares of which reported area for land use is 30604 million hectares the net area cultivated is about 14260 million hectares ie about 466 per cent of the total reported area since nearly 50 million hectares of area is sown more than oncethe cropping intensity works out to 1351 forests account for about 6897 million hectares ie 225 percent of the total reported land area also nearly 1397 million hectares are cultivable wastelands and 991 million hectares are fallow lands only about 30 percent of the total cropped area is irrigatedand the remaining area is rain fed the available statistics further shows that only about 66 percent of the gross cropped area is under food crops and nearly 34 percent area under nonfood crops cereals and pulses account for nearly 5293 per cent and 1264 percent of the total area respectively fruitsand vegetables occupy nearly 424 percent of area haque 2003 plantation crops accounts for insignificant proportion of total area at the macro level although these are very important crops for certain regions namely tea in assam and west bengal coffee in kerala and karnataka coconut cashew nut and rubber in kerala and tamil nadu of the totalcoconut area of 184 million hectares kerala accounts for 51 percent followed by tamil nadu 17 percent karnataka 18 percent andhra pradesh 54 percent and other 96 percent in the case of cashew nut there are about 601 thousand hectares of which kerala accounts for 20 percent andhrapradesh 15 percent karnataka maharashtra and tamil nadu 14 percent each orissa 11 percent and goa 8 percent and others 4 percent tea covers nearly 434 lakh hectares of area in the country of which 333 lakh hectares are in the states of assam and west bengal coffee is predominantly grownin the three southern states of karnataka kerala and tamil nadu of the total coffee area of about 241 lakh hectares karnataka shares 128 lakh hectares kerala 665 thousand hectares and tamil nadu 329 thousand hectares similarly rubber is the crop of southern states of the total rubber areaof 559 lakh hectares kerala shares 473 lakh hectares karnataka 196 thousand hectares and tamil nadu 187 thousand hectares also the contribution of plantation crops to foreign exchange earnings is very significant while tea and coffee earn sizeable foreign exchange rubber is a valuable importsubstitute for rubberbased industries according to population census of india 2001 there are about 4025 million rural workers of which 1276 million are cultivators and 1075 million are agricultural labourers table 11 in other words pure agricultural workers constitute nearly 584 per cent of the total rural workers of which317 percent are owner cultivators and 267 percent are mainly agricultural wage earners agriculture statistics at a glance sourced from registrar general of india new delhi 2001 the latest available agricultural census data govt of india agricultural census division ministry of agriculture 2002also reveal that about 78 percent of operational holdings in the country are marginal and small having less than 2 hectares about 13 percent holdings have 2 to 4 hectares and 71 per cent have 4 to 10 hectares of land haque 20033the relatively large holdings above 10 hectares number only about 16 percent of the total operational holdings however these 16 per cent of the large holdings occupy about 173 per cent of the total area while 78 percent of holdings which are less than 2 hectares operate only about 324 percent of the total area this speaks of inequality in the distribution of operational holdings alsothere is inequality of income between agricultural and nonagricultural workers which is evident from the fact that percentage share of agriculture in current total gdp is only 242 while the percentage share of agricultural work force to total work force comes to about 60 percent the agricultural census data clearly bear out the fact that indian agriculture is dominated by small and marginal farms which are basically subsistence farmers they provide mainly for self consumption however some of these farmers have to sell their produce immediately after harvest at low prices and buy the same products later at high prices table 11 1 population and agricultural workers in millions year rural

market in agriculture according to 55th of national sample survey nsso 2001 agricultural labour households constitute nearly 322 percent of the total rural households the selfemployed in agriculture account for 327 per cent of the total rural households in fact the proportion of agricultural labour households increased from 303 per cent in 199394 to 322 percent in 19992000 while that of cultivating selfemployed households declined from 378 percent in 199394 to 327 per cent in 19992000 the proportion of femaleheaded households increased from 97 per cent in 199394 to 104 percent in 19992000 nearly 626 per cent of the rural households belonged to less than rs 470 monthly percapita expenditure class nearly 46 percent rural households reported that none in the family was4having any work 277 per cent reported that only one male member was usually working while 278 households indicated that one male and one female member were usually employed of the female households 228 percent reported that none of their person was usually employed and 396 percent mentioned that only one female member was usually working the nsso data further revealed that 72 percent of the rural households did not possess any land and 51 percent householdspossessed less than 04 hectare about 191 percent household possessed between 041 and 1 hectare and 115 percent between 101 and 2 hectare only 112 percent possessed land above 2 hectare thus by and large indian farming is dominated by small and marginal farmers in fact the proportionof rural households not possessing any land or which possessed less than 04 hectare land was quite high in the states of bihar goa maharashtra sikkim and tamilnadu also the proportion of agriculture labour households was quite high in some of these states it was 38 percent in bihar 417 percentin maharashtra and karnataka and 452 percent in tamilnadu another important source of data is census of india 2001 according to which there are nearly 127 million cultivators 1075 million agricultural labourers and 6 million other farm workers engaged in livestock forestry and plantations of the total agricultural labourers 380 per cent were femaleand 619 percent male workers also among livestock forestry and plantation workers 783 percent were male workers and 217 percent were female workers about 992 percent of agricultural workers were reported to be unorganized and unprotected status of plantation workers the data compiled by labour bureau government of india from annual returns under the plantation labour act 1951 show that nearly 109 lakh persons were employed in the plantationsector comprising 102 lakh in tea 30680 in coffee 27302 in rubber 3463 in cardamom 2696 in cinchona and the remaining in other plantations at all india level 50 percent workers in tea and coffee plantations 34 percent workers in rubber 62 percent workers in cardamom 38 percent workersin palm oil and 45 percent in cinchona were women in the plantation sector nearly 80 percent are small holders having less than 20 acres each workers in smaller estates are by and large unorganized and their levels of employment are relatively lower than their counterparts in large plantation estatesit has been known that coffee and rubber planters in kerala and karnataka that workers in small plantation estates receive rs 10 to rs 20 less per day as compared to those working in large estates also they do not adequately get the benefit of minimum wages bonus and other facilities such ashousing medical care maternity benefit etc laws governing labour standards in agriculture the government of india has passed a number of laws in order to promote labour standards in agriculture these laws are also in conformity with various relevant international labour organization ilo conventions such as i minimum wage fixing machinery agriculture convention 1969 129 ii equal remuneration convention 1951 no 100 iii discrimination employment and occupation5convention 1958 no 111 iv forced labour convention 1930 no 29 v abolition of forced labour convention 1957 105 vi minimum age convention 1973 no 138 vii worst form of child labour convention 1999 no 182 viii the safety and health in agriculture convention 2001 no 184 and ix plantation convention 1958 no 110 the plantation labour act 1951 as amended in 1981 this is an act to provide for the welfare of labour and to regulate the conditions of work in plantations according to this act in every plantation effective arrangements shall be made by theemployers to provide and maintain at convenient places in the plantation a sufficient supply of wholesome drinking water to all workers medical facilities canteen crches recreation facilities educational facilities housing facilities and annual leave with wages and maternity benefits in mostschools there is a provision of free midday meal for the children of those employees drawing a monthly salary of rs 750 every plantation employing 50 or more women workers also provides crches however only 20 to 25 percent of the plantation workers who are employed in large estates above 25 acres and who come under the purview of the plantation labour act get such benefit about 75 to 80 per cent holdings in tea coffee and rubber are small and marginal where workers have access to free housing facility free electricity and drinking water facilities and sometimes even medical carethey do not generally receive many of the benefits indicated above particularly women workers do not have access to maternity benefit in smaller estates based on personal interviews also the wage rates of these workers are less by rs 10 to 20 as compared to those working in larger estates where theworkers are organized besides they do not get subsidized rations unlike the organized plantation workers poverty and unemployment according to various rounds of national sample survey the absolute number of rural poor persons increased from 232 million in 198788 to 244 million in 199394 and then declined to 193 million in 19992000 as shown by table 12 still about 27 percent rural people are reported to bebelow the

agriculture according to swaminathan the famous agricultural scientist some historians believe that it was woman who first domesticated crop plants and thereby initiated the art and science of farmingwhile men went out hunting in search of food women started gathering seeds from the native flora and began cultivating those of interest from the point of view lf food feed fodder fibre and fuel women have played and continue to playa key role in the conservation of basic life support systems such as land water flora and fauna they have protected the health of the soil throughorganic recyclining and promoted crop security through the maintenance of varietal diversity and genetic resistance there fore without the total intellectual and physical participation of women it will not be possible to popularize alternative systems of land management to shifting cultivation arrestgene and soil erosion and promote the care of the soil and the health of economic plants and farm animals prasad singh 1992 that women play a significant and crucial role in agricultural development and allied fields including in the main crop production livestock production horticulture post harvest operations agrosocial forestry fisheries etc is a fact long taken for granted but also long ignored the nature and extent of womens involvement in agriculture no doubt varies greatly from region to region even within a region their involvement varies widely among different ecological subzones farming systemscastes classes and stages in the family cycle but regardless of these variations there is hardly any activity in agricultural production except ploughing in which women are not actively involved in some of the farm activities like processing and storage women predominate so strongly that men workersare numerically insignificant aggarwal 2003 studies on women in agriculture conducted in india and other developing and under developed countries all point to the conclusion that women contribute far more to agricultural production than has generally been acknowledged recognition of their crucialrole in agriculture should not obscure the fact that farm women continue to be concerned with their primary functions as wives mothers and homemakers despite their importance to agricultural production women face severe handicaps they are in fact the largest group of landless labourers with little real security in case of breakup of the familyowing to death or divorce inheritance laws and customs discriminate against them land reform and settlement programmes usually give sole title and hence the security needed for obtaining production credits to the husband agricultural development programmes are usually planned by men and aimedat men mechanization for example alleviates the burden of tasks that are traditionally mens responsibility10leaving womens burdens unrelieved or even increased the excess burden of work on women the double day of the farm work plus house work also acts as a stimulus to have many children so that they can help out with chores from an early age extension workers almost exclusively aim their advice at mens activities and crops in some regions this bias may depress production of subsistence foodcrops often womens crops in favour of increased production of cash crops often mens crops in favour of increased production of cash crops often mens crops so that family nutrition suffers it may not be out of place to mention here that considering their dual responsibilities within and outside the home it would be in the fitness of things that more and more in the village training isorganized for rural farm women to suit their convenience with due realization that institutional training is important in its own place in order that farm women get a fair deal at the hands of change agents one of the remedial measures that needs to be undertaken is to induct a sizeable number of well trained women personnelin training and extension programmes of agricultural development agencies at all levels and more so at the grassroot level according to 1991 census the male cultivators has increased in the country by 1167 percent from 767 in 1981 to 856 million in 1991 the female cultivators however have increased at muchfaster rate of 4523 percent from 148 million in 1981 to 215 million in 1991 as shown in table 21 the number of male agricultural labourer increased by 3148 percent but that of female by 3645 percent 74 percent of the entire female working force is engaged in agriculture operations about 60percent of agricultural operations like sowing of seeds transportation of sapling winnowing storage of grain etc are handled exclusively by women while in other jobs they share the work with women apart from participation in actual cultivation women participate in various forms of processing andmarketing of agricultural produce aggarwal 2003 in rural india the prosperity of the household depends on the prosperity of agriculture and allied occupation in any particular point of time visvis the role of women in innumerable activities connected with farming dairying sericulture etc but the women hands are invisible even to this day so it is not surprising that the agricultural extension activities is mainly a male oriented pursuit multidimensional role of women i agriculture sowing transplanting weeding irrigation fertilizer application plant protection harvesting winnowing storing etc ii domestic cooking child rearing water collection fuel wood gathering household maintenance etc iii allied activities cattle management fodder collection milking etc11mainly rural women are engaged in agricultural activities in three different ways depending on the socioeconomic status of their family and regional factors they are work as i paid labourersii cultivator doing labour on their own land andiii managers of certain aspects of agricultural production by way of labour supervision and the participation in post harvest operations the table 12 1 depicts the number of women workers engaged in agriculture table 12 1 women workers in agriculture million women workers in agriculture million

agriculture sector at the price level of 198081 in 1950 51 the productivity per labour was rs 2305which increased to rs 2794 and further increased to rs 3157 in 1990 the productivity has not doubled

undp report the gender related development index of developed and developing countries where india has the rank of 1 osth as men migrate in search of betterpaid work women in rural india are taking over agricultural work in the villages they face meager wages long hours hazardous work and sexual harassmentfigures from the census show that amongst rural women the percentage of marginal workers defined as working for less than 183 days per year has increased significantly from 81 per cent in 1991 to 142 percent in 2002 during the same period there was a sharp fall in the percentage ofmain workers more than 183 days a year especially male workers coming from rural areas the figures thus show a casualization and feminization of the workforce in rural areas with the number of marginal women workers becoming larger and more significant while male main workers in ruralareas have declined16these changes also coincide with the period of the 1990s when india really began to part of a globalize economy some of the changes that have ensured the huge displacement of labour fromagriculture are given below a shift from subsistence farming to marketable crops irrespective of regions changes in crop patterns showed a common trend all the shifts resulted in a decrease in the labourrequired greater use of labourdisplacing machinery a change in land use patternsfrom agriculture to urban industrial areas or brick kilns and in coastal areas to exportoriented aquaculture all the new activities displace labourfrom agriculture but create fewer jobs than they destroy more work less pay the estimates for changes in the last 57 years show declines in employment ranging from 20 per cent to as much as 77 per cent employment in agriculture is thus available for fewer days peryear it is therefore becoming essential for men to migrate in search of betterpaid work women arefilling this vacuum women are forced to accept work in agriculture in their own village under very badconditions because they cannot migrate as easily as men the dependence of womens labour on family farms especially during the peak periods of sowing and harvesting has become very common about 15 years ago agricultural work was consideredacceptable for poor tribal women muslim women today even who were traditionally bound by rulesof purdah go out to work for wages in the fields in certain areas farmers on the other hand also seem to prefer women as agricultural workers the farmer is faced with the increasing costs of production required for modern agriculture he finds that he cansqueeze his labour costs by using lowerpaid women workers for instance women are preferred tomen in north 24 parganas west bengal by the owners because they are docile require lower wagesand are less lazy than men similarly the work of women within familybased agriculture is preferredbecause it is cheaper than hiring labour women agricultural workers although they represent a big proportion of all women workers continue to receive lower wages than men the ministry of labour puts the difference at 60 per centof mens wages while the indian labour journal showed that women received 75 per cent of mensearnings the wage differentials prevailing in some states are given in table 1 while earnings from agricultural work have not improved for women modernization of agriculture has in some cases brought new kinds of problems and demand the existence of patriarchy at all levels also intertwines with the workrelated problems of women a study on the feminization of agricultural labour in andhra pradesh shows that despite the increasing involvement of women in paid work womens relative power within the family had declined17table 12 9 malefemale wage rates in indian agriculture t rade

parlors television etc have invaded villages increasing seasonal migration has also exposed rural workers to more affluent areasand to cities one of the noticeable impacts of this is an increased desire for consumer goods spiraling demands for dowry are seen as one of the easiest and fastest ways to meet this desire dowry is thus spreading to communities where it did not exist before in tribal families where a bride paricewas the practice the girls family now has to buy the groom all the goods that make a fat dowry the bride price is only a token mortgaging and selling of land to meet the dowry demands of the bride grooms family has become an important mechanism by which poor and marginalized farmers losetheir land a study on land rights for women in west bengal recently found that 399 of the house holds surveyed have had to part with land or raise loans at high interest rates in order to pay dowry in fact 79 of the families who sold land to pay for dowry were muslim a commonly where dowry was nota tradition in addition the people who were selling or mortgaging their lands for dowry were agricultural labourers and marginal farmers agro chemicals have become an integral part of the development process of agriculture and the use is expected to increase manifold in india fertilizer too a large extent have not affected womensrole adversily but the weedicides and herbicides have almost replaced the manual uprooting of weeds and hoeing for destroying weeds in important crops slike rice and wheat weeding and hoeing used to employ a large number of female labour daysacre with the introduction of chemicals to destroyweeds womens participation has almost ceased thus herbicides have affected womens employment adversily as they were the principal labour for weeding singh and punia 1991 on the other hand women from landless families do not get fodder for their animals which they used to get from farmers field in lieu of wages or on mutual interest basis keeping of animals onpurchased fodder is difficult for poor families there by kepriving them of the animal products and by products in their diet due to the use of agrochemicals women are exposed to several health hazards such as gynecological infections arthritis intestinal and parasitic infections18biological technologies in terms of high yielding and short duration varieties have offered better remunerations and intensifications of crops production thereby increased labour absorption capacity in the agriculture sector with the development of biotechnology there is every possibility of propagation of plant and animal species in the petridishes in laboratories tissue culture technology under thesecircumstances women folk employed in raising nurseries would be left in large singh and punia 1991 agriculture growth has not alleviated female poverty rather it appears to have set in motion process which in the long run could worsen the situation in many regions of the country women in decision making in agriculture womens role in agricultural operations animal husbandry and other economically productive activities is very significant they contribute about 6070 percent of the labour required for theseactivities thus playing a pivotal role in sustaining economy the decision making process is an important segment of every household because it makes implementation of a plan or programme quite easy in rural areas of the country both husband and wife are jointly responsible for making decisions on matters like family obligations specific housing charges and purchase of household articles howeverwomens suggestions are not given due consideration in the decisions pertaining to agricultural sector and important family matters it is because the majority of women are illiterate have little time to know about the latest techniques of framing and restricted mobility due to several cultural taboos in an interview with female respondents it was noticed that male members only sought their consent whereas their suggestionsobjections were not taken into account thus it was evident that women had to play second fiddle to men in decisionmaking another study conducted in haryana revealed that farm women did not decide independently about any farm operation but participated inalmost all the decisions and dominated only decisions more related to home sphere ie storage of farm produce purchasesale of animal and credit the table 71 shows the decision making process of women in agriculture in himachal pradesh bala 2003 we generally talk of womens empowerment which can be said that women should have powers to determine their own actions power to have an authority to make decisions and guide their destiny this power in decision making can be acquired and exercised only if they have a thorough knowledge about the various porgrammes plans and current issues access to the basic human development andsocial policies generally women have less access to information about technology by virtue of their inferior educational status and relative isolation from public life thus there is a hesitation to come out and interact at times even the suggestions of knowledgeable rural women are ignored or are not takenseriously because men consider it disgraceful to accept the decision of women this is because traditionally men have been major lawmakers of society many policies and decisions neglect women and undermine their abilities and roles19the undesired restrictions imposed by elderly people in the society on their daughters and daughtersinlaw should be relaxed to facilitate their mobility in order to have easy access to the outer world most importantly the women should have a penchant for self empowerment through enhancing their knowledge and skills empowerment without any change in mens attitude or without their willingnesswill only aggravate family problems increasing dissatisfaction and ensuring that women will continue to be at the receiving end government policies should be framed to provide legal support and instill confidence in women porgrammes should be developed exclusively for women to build leadership skills for managing agriculturalcommunity based development activities access of technology inputs and credit has to be ensured predominantly through women extension workers they should be trained in farm management sills and made capable of taking even complex decisions like shifting from subsistence farming to diversifiedagriculture with stand competition form market forces improvement in work or farm efficiency etc the extent of participation in the decisionmaking activities in house hold and agriculture related and other socioculture affairs reflects the status of women in the family as well as society table 72 shows the activities by decision makers in household related activities in orissa chaudhary 2004 t able 73 shows that major decision regarding purchase of every household items are taken by males decisions in matters of food and clothing more or less have an equal participation rate between males and females but decision regarding savings and investments and purchase of household assets is taken by males ie 835 per cent and 813 per cent respectively as the male members control thefinance this creates an adverse impact on womens access to household assets and other household activities chowdhary 2004 t able 74 shows that the major decision makers in agricultural activities are men even though women performs more in agricultural related activities than men even they need not be consulted atthe time of purchase of animals or change of crop an average a women spends 14 hours a day working in and outside the home during harvesting season she spends about 16 hours a day the question arises why womens role in the economy is not recognized and has given such an inferior position20table 12 10 decision making pattern of rural

of women in agriculture sector is also confirmed in a study conducted by sethi 1991 in himachal pradesh where womens opinion is not normally considered and their opinions is also not considered in the matters related to participation in developmental activities the social role as a decision maker in the production and the distribution of products and their participation andrepresentations in village developmental activities has not changed over the time in all such social relations men continue to dominate the sune and there exists no party of decision making in gender relations moreover womens exclusion from public life keep them out of the decision making process related to various rural developmental activities such as the utilization of loans and subsidies underthe various integrated rural development programme irdp schemes women also fail to get loans sanctioned for agricultural development or various schemes under rural employment programme rep women have no representation in the agricultural marketing committees and other similar bodies thegovernmental and nongovernmental organizations ngo also prefer men for these purposes thus the ideology of segregation and seclusion of women helps in keeping them out of the various decision making process concerning the various facts of rural development it is for this reason that to find thatwhereas womens labour is utilized for both productive as well as nonproductive work the various source of power lies in the hands of men only women in plantation faulty policy of liberalization in india plantation sector occupies a unique position due to its agro industrial features and large number of women in employment women are more preferred by the plantation authority because they can be employed on low wages and are more committed also they can be easily convinced forthe unauthorized deduction from wages as well as delayed wages because of their subservient nature and low level of education and awareness bhadra 1991 the special feature of plantation is that it not only employs the men members but also women and children above the age of 12 years and women have an important role to play the reasons for this are a plantation work is only a special kind of agriculture off work familiar to indian women the vast majority of them live in rural areas b facilities have been given to make workers to settle down on or in the vicinity of the plantation and to take their families and wives with them c under the old system labour contract was based on the principle of utilizing every able bodied persons of the family and fixing the rates accordingly d many women had to seek employment in order to balance the family budget although the contract system has been abolished the wage system e as the entire labour force is residential the women can take up employment without causing serious disruptions to the family23the social and demographic profile of the workers in plantation sector such as rubber indicates certain interesting patterns the sex wise segregation of the workers reveals stinking skewed distribution of work force with lower participation of women however a probing into the poor participation of women in the occupation revealed the invisible participation of women is more than two thirds of thecases quite often the male tapers are found supported by female members and even children of the family the male tapers who are as the dejure workers get considerable assistance from their family members for collecting the latex transportation of latex and preparation of rubber sheets usually themale tapers start tapping in the pre early hours of the day and the women and children are found joining the work with a lag of twothree hours here though the work is carried out collectively the contribution of women and children remain invisibles as they are neither recognized nor remuneratedas assistants the lower absorption of women labour in rubber holdings has been cited as a major issue in the development discourse of the state with the commendable increase in the area under the crop at the cost of female labour intensive crops such as paddy to sure of the officials of rubberboard of india this argument was one of the factors that tempted the board to choose a logo that illustrated female tapers at work remesh 2004 the lower participation of women during the initial hours of tapping is mainly due to their engagement in domestic chores preparing break fast and lunch sending the younger ones to schoolscattle care and so on carried out by women members before joining along with some food as helpers during later hours in the morning in the tea gardens the female permanent workers generally do the plucking the other work maintenance of plantation pruning spraying are done by male workers during the peak season minorgirls from the labour families particularly women and children from neighbouring villages are employed for plucking of leaves india is the fourth largest producer of natural rubber in the world after thailand indonesia and malaysia and at the same time is the fourth largest consumer after usa japan and south korearubber cultivation in india had been traditionally confined to the narrow belt extending from kanyakumari district of tamilnadu to west of western ghats within this zone kerala assumes considerable significance with 86 percent of the area and about 95 percent of rubber production within kerala t ravancore cochin region continues to be the dominant belt of rubber cultivation with 72 percent of total area under the crop and 75 percent of the rubber tapped area t oday rubber cultivation has expanded tremendously in kerala taking about 48 lakh hectares which has the second position in terms of area after coconut though there are no reliable estimatesavailable it is widely understood that within the holding sector the share of small and tiny holdings less than 5 ha is significant in terms of area production and employment for instance a recent study reports that the share of smallholdings with an average size of less than 2 hectares in total areaunder rubber has increased from 53 percent in 195556 to more than 83 percent in 2001 with an average holding size is less than 05 ha viswanathan etal 200324unfortunately the rubber economy of kerala particularly its small holding sector undergoing a phase of crisis since 1996 november with a trend of price crash of unprecedented scale and proportions from its all time peak of rs 70 per kg the market price of rubber has gone down to rs 26 by 2000 ad this drastic decline in rubber prices is widely attributed to faulty import policy of liberalization ofthe rubber economy in a globalization regime that commenced since early 1990s and acquired momentum by the mid 1990s after india joined wto remesh 2004 following the onset of the era of trade liberalization in the fam products and the concomitant implementation of the agreements of agriculture aoa under the regime of wto from 1995 onwardsthe agriculture products in general and plantation products in particular have experienced considerable levels in price crash there is an apprehension that the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports has led to steady increase in the cost of production in plantation sector incase of rubber more importantly theintegration of indian market to that of international is reported to have led to the building up of huge surplus stocks this in turn brings down the price thereby intensifying the problem of grower and peppering the job prospects to the thousands of tapers and the women associated with them productionand supply of natural rubber is far in excess of the domestic needs due to this unprecedented fall in price of the produce small growers in kerala are finding it difficult to pay even the wages to minimize cost of production wage cuts and deferments in wages or other monetary benefits are being resorted to continue tapping and the workers employed severalgrowers have already resorted to large scale cost cutting of various essentials such as minimization of fertilizer use pesticide spraying soil developments land up gradation and even deferring replanting as the tapers are also well aware of the price crash there is a growing tendency among tapers to empathies the small growers and to respond to their grievances compassionately in many cases tapers have agreed to defer the wage payments till the sale of produce and also sympathetically considered the growers viewpoints while demanding compensation and other benefits in some cases it is noted that the growing understanding between the employer and employee in the period of crisis has resulted in the product sharing arrangement in place of piece rate wage system during the period of continuing price crash in the rubber economy tapers are fully aware that there is no point in collectively bargaining for a wage revision which is simply unaffordable by the farmer due to this they are even ready to continue in the job without any wage revision though the wages in the alternative rural occupation and the cost of living of the workers have shot up considerably there are also certain shortcomings in the existing framework of legislation which considers plantation as largescale cultivation for instance the labour in small and tiny rubber holdings below 5 ha are out of the reach of the protective framework of the plantation labour act of 1951 which defines plantation as any land used for intended to be used for growing tea coffee rubber which25ad measures 5 ha or more and in which fifteen or more persons are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months this classification irrespective of the fact that there has been an increasing tendency of fragmentation of holdings in all plantations crops in the recent decades leading to a gross exclusion of a major chunk of plantation workers from the protective provision of labour legislation like supply of drinking watersuitable medical facilities crches as well as bonus gratuity and provident fund it is beyond argument that the penetration of globalization and the resultant price crisis has led to a gross erosion of increase or bargaining power of the workers given the context of the general crisis in the economy the tapers are not finding any alternative employment and are forced to continuewith their present engagements despite the fact that the wages are not revised for the past few years in addition this unprecedented stagnation of wages some tapers and women workers are even anticipating further wage cut in the near future t ea plantation workers in kerala west bengal and tamil nadu are facing starvation following the closing down of several small and medium companies the reason the unrestricted imports and a sharp fall in international price of tea the ugly reality of the resulting poverty writ large on the faces of malnourished women and children and disillusioned them once safely engaged in plantation workis the tragedy story of market driven humanitarian crisis in the past few years ever since economic liberalization became the development mantra kerala has been at the receiving end flooded with cheap and highly subsidized agricultural imports its agrarian economy has been thrown out of gear whether it is the import of palm oil rubber orcoffee or tea almost every aspect of the states socioeconomy has been negatively impacted coconut prices have crashed from rs 10 to rs 2 rubber has plummeted from rs 60 to rs 16 per kg and coffee from rs 58 in 1999 to rs 30 per kg in 2000 even spices have hit spared with pepper prices falling from rs 2600 to rs 1300 per quintal in the consecutive period while ketalasfarmers are naturally a worried lot the changing global intellectual property rights iprs regime is certain to further throttle domestic agricultural research which in turn will impact farm production and the repercussions will eventually be felt by the industry which will find the export market restrictedand monopolized by the patentholders kerala is not alone the destructive fallout from the emerging global trade paradigm is being felt all over the country if not in the same magnitude but before analyzing the bitter political harvests and the growing disenchantment with the world trade organization wto it is important to understandwhy and how the market rules play against the indian farmers and for that matter farmers in the developing countries now in assam every worker in the estates fets 6 kgs of cereal in 15 days a male worker is also entitled to get 6 kgs of cereal for his wife and 3 kgs for each of his children however if the only26 women the foundation of the dairy industry27permanent worker in a household is a woman whatever may be her family size she is entitled for her quota of ration only das 2002 scenario is worst in worst bengal thousands of jobless families have survived by eating rats and snakes in their villages there were no snakes or rats left in the plantations as all these had been caught and eaten by hungry workers a shocked supreme court had sought the west bengal governments response on an expert panels report which said that deaths due to starvation among workers ofabandoned tea garden have assumed disastrous proportions women in dairy sector the overall farming performance is the farming productivity behaviour of farm women comprising six components viz cropping intensity cropping yield index milk yield index level of adoptioncommercialization index and expansiondiversification index in a rice based farming system the result indicate that there is significant difference between small medium and large farms women with respect to overall farming performance it is observed that small farm women had less croppingintensity crop yield index level of adoption commercialization and expansiondiversification index when compared to medium and large women however in case of milk yield index small farmwomen are on par with medium but higher than the large farmwomen reddy 2003 according to verma 1992 animal husbandry is predominantly a male affair in case of high economic status as majority of them employ permanent male labour to look after the animalswhereas it is predominantly a female affair in case of farmers of medium and low socioeconomic status on an average a woman devotes 35 hours per day for animal husbandry activities against only 16 hours per day devoted by men in this category women accounted for 93 of total employment in dairy production depending upon the economic status women perform the tasks of collecting fodder collecting and processing dung women undertakedung composting and carrying to the fields women also prepare cooking fuel by mixing dung with twigs and crop residues though women playa significant role in livestock management and production womens control over livestock and its products is negligible men leaving only 14 to women assumethe vast majority of the dairy cooperative membership in tribal communities in low rainfall semiarid and arid areas much of the work with regard to animal management has to be looked after by women due to migration of males for work however in many cases the income from dairy animals does not remain in the hands of women and neither does the decision regarding sale and purchase however due to the move to develop womens dairy cooperatives in many states in india women have better control over sale of milk and use of income from it another positive development is recognition of women as members of dairy cooperative societies so that the price of milk supplied to the society can be paid to the women directly till a few yearsago women were not made registered members of the dairy cooperative society the registration was in the name of the husband and thus he collected the money for milk produced and supplied by the women28women are well aware of each animals behaviour and produdion characteristics women are knowledgeable about local feed resources and are able to identify beneficial grasses weeds and fodder tress for feeding of dairy animals while the contribution of women to the animals management is recognized the experiences of women regarding animal diseases and their perceptions are ignorednow there is some realization about the knowledge possessed by women and the need to improve their knowledge skills and awareness feeding participation of women in indoor feeding activities such as providing water to animals mixing ration and preparing feed is very high as far as the involvement in outdoors activities isconcerned such as cutting and transportation of fodder the deployment of women is low health care the share of rural women is found more in all animal health care related activities performed at home activities like care of sick animals care of animals during pregnancy care of newly born calf and applying and giving medicine at home are performed jointly by women membersof the family processing and marketing related activities the participation of rural women in processing activities is found higher than in marketing related activities such as purchase of animals selling of milk disposal of animals etc management women perform all the activities related to management of animals like cleaning of animals and their shed milking and making cow dung cakes in india animal husbandry is a vocation for millions of small farmers and land less people a large percentage of them raise animals on crop residues and common property resources when in some developed countries less than 3 of the adult population is engaged in agriculture and animalhusbandry 70 percent of indian population is dependent on agriculture and animal husbandry of which 30 percent are landless women provide 60 percent of the livestock farming labour and more than 90 percent of work related to the care of animals is rendered by women folk of the family during 200102 the contribution of livestock sector to the countrys gdp was 559 percent the value of output of livestock and fisheries sector was estimated to be around 179544 crores which is about 277 percent of the total value of output of rs648122 crores from agriculture and allied sectors with an estimated output of rs 103804 crores the contribution of milk was higher thanpaddy rs 73965 crores wheat rs 43816 crores and sugarcane rs 28592 crores milk and livestock sector provides regular employment to about 11 million in principal status and 8 million in subsidiary status women in animal husbandry and livestock sector constitute 69 percent of the labourforce as against 35 percent in crop farming economic survey 200203 dairy farming has grown from largely unorganized complex activity into a vast organized industry that encompasses not only increased production of milk and milk products but also the breeding of higher yielding cattle and the scientific rearing of cattle and production of cattle feeds this has29proportionately increased the demand of trained manpower in this sector however the implementations of wto policies will totally ruin the dairy sector and thus affecting the available employment opportunities a common feature in region where dairying is an important commercial activity of the rural population as in gujarat and punjab is that it is the women folk who essentially maintain and manage the dairy cows and buffaloes in areas where the milk produced is channeled through dairy plantsbringing daily or weekly income to the household the dairy activity raises the status of women winner of the prestigious magsaysay award mrs ela bhatt highlights the need for giving women their due place in dairy development for their empowerment and economic well being womens access to training in modern dairying and cooperative management is essential the membership in most of indias 70000 village level dairy cooperative societies dcs is heavily dominated by men the picture is now gradually changing in the favor of women efforts are on to give them their due place in dairy development presently some 2476 allwomen dcs are functioning in the country in selected states out of 92 million total memberships in dcs 163 million are women 18 per cent however women constituteless than three per cent of total board member women second in the land agenda the land reform measures adopted by the indian union or respective states are not in accordance with any personal law of any community in matter of womens right to inheritance of agriculture land states either have their own policy or refer it to the principle of personal laws jyoti gupta 2002 in a discussion conducted by in west bengal the women asserted the importance of ownership of productive resources in their name their first demand was we want land in our own name various reasons were forwarded by the women for such a demand jyoti gupta 2002 1 old age security if sons do not look after them2 the predominant notion that their daughters can inherit land if the mother has it in her own name 3 women can use the property to pay for their daughters marriage in the absence of the husband as sons usually inherit the property and may be unwilling to pay for their sisters marriage 4 lack of security in the matrimonial home as women do not have any legal right to property be it land cattle or house 5 given the rise in the cases of divorce desertion and physical violence against women by husbands the women expressed the urgent need for secure shelter be it legal right to be homestead of their parents or land to cultivation306 the younger women especially those who have already divorced deserted or remained unmarried preferred to be given a share in he parents properly be it land house or both 7 women felt that they should have independent access to ownership of productive resources to be able to counter the system of dowry as well as to free themselves of a dependent status all their lives 8 the women also pointed out that apart from ploughing they participate in all agricultural operations women who belongedto peasant house hold but did not have to work as agricultural labouers also pointed out that they bear all responsibility for the agriculture produce once it is brought home from the field yet they are not considered agriculturistor cultivation only their husbands are recorded as cultivators women felt that ownership in their name would make a difference to their access and control over the women also told that though are capable of ploughing but they are not allowed 9 while women do not have ownership rights recorded in their name they however bear the responsibility of returning debts incurred by their husbands in lieu of land mortgage 10 women are often not informed about such debts or transactions the husbands enters into with the assets of the family the women felt that such a solution could be checked if they as owners were to be signatories to the transaction right and privileges of women in

have prescribed to alldeveloping economics a uniform package of policies which are not based on the specifications of these economics their view is clear if an economy is facing problem it is because its structure is not suitable to the one required by the dominant world economic interest thus the prescription is thatthe structure of the economy has to be adjusted to that required for its incorporation into the world markets this is what the wtg is forcing on all economics and that is what the world bank prescribes as structural adjustment programme sap the interests of the local population of the countriesundertaking sap or implementing the wtg provisions do not matter t oday a large majority of indian do not know what the new economic policies launched in 1991 are or what does wtg stand for they do not know that it is setting the agenda for the way they will live and work for the next fifty years or more they do not know that wto is changing therules in the direction that are weighted against them it is not just the common people who find things difficult to understand even well educated people find hard to comprehend our legislator and policy makers are also confused parliamentarian failed to understand the issue whenever any discussiontook place these had been piecemeal as a matter of fact the problem arises also because the developed countries have not reduced their aggregate measure of domestic support ams and export subsidies as reported by oecd 2001 the total support to agriculture in usa increased form 41852 in base period of 1986 88to 50884 during 19982000 this meant about 22 percent rise in european union it rose from 94640 in the base period to 105032 in 19982000 ie by 11 percent in japan it increased from 53354 to 55498 ie by 4 percent in korea it raised by 42 percent ie from usd 12218 in the37base period to usd 17324 during 19982000 in usa it was all shown under green box subsidy as against this product specific support in india was 305 billion dollar ie about 348 of the total value of agricultural output while nonproduct specific support after adjustment of support to resource poor farmers worked out to 75 percent in 199596 and only 2 to 3 percent in 199798 quite interestingly it has also been observed that the global agricultural trade as such has suffered a set back in the wake of wto the volume of agricultural exports which was growing at the annual rate of 52 percent during the early 1990s decelerated to 34 percent during 1995 to 1990 ramesh chand 2001 however the annual growth rates of indias agricultural export declined more sharply from about 156 percent in the early 1990s to 56 percent in the post wto period ie 19961999 similarly while the overall growth rate of developing countries market access to develop countries decelerated marginally from 077 percent per annum in the early 1990s to 037 percent in the late 1990s in act the small and marginal farmers and agricultural labourers who constitute the marginalized section of the rural population lose on both production and consumption fronts because of their low bargaining power and participation in development they are simply net losers further a recent study by ramesh chand 2001 shows that overall net social gains of trade liberalization have been engativefor relatively under developed regions of the country impact of liberalization on agricultural workers and women there is apprehension that economic liberalization which tends to induce privatization and marketled technological change may affect employment and income prospects of rural women adversely for instance the impact of opening of fisheries and agro processing to multinational and corporate reportedly displaced million of workers the impact of economic liberalization on agricultural workers and women may be summarized as follows the volatility of international prices of agricultural commodities has affected agricultural workers in india adversely particularly during the last few years or so most of indias agricultural commodities have lost international competitiveness due to low internationalprices the exports of agricultural commodities have fallen simultaneaously there have been increased imports of edible oils and raw cotton which have depressed the domestic prices of these commodities it is apprehended that the process of economic liberalization will ultimately result in asituation in which multinational companies will dominate the agricultural scene in india and small farmers may lose their grips over agriculture posing a risk of livelihood insecurity for millions of agricultural workers and rural women38 in the wake of wto not only agricultural exports have declined but also rate of growth of agricultural output and employment consequently both cultivating households as well as landless particularly women labourers have suffered a loss of income in the wake of economic liberalization cultivators as well as agricultural labourers look depressesed because of deterioration in their income levels as well as uncertain futurealso the gap between agricultural and nonagricultural workers is widening there is a secular worsening of the condition of agricultural labourers due to increase casualization of labour force and inability of the organizeq farm and nonfarm sectors to absorb the growing labour force in the plantation sector too the decline in the export earnings from tea coffee and rubberand low domestic prices have affected both income and employment of women particularly smaller plantations find it difficult to maintain the levels of employment and wages of the labourers agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures sps though the wto provisions lays down that the minimum five percent market access may have to be given by importing countries the developed countries impose certain quality norms and product specification and other sanitary and phytosanitary regulations the eu now insists that milking cows be fully mechanized to avoid contamination and potable water used to process milk kulkarni 2001 it also prescribes that only steel machinery and filtered air be used for processing to adhere to these norms the indian dairy industry may have to invest much capital in the required infrastructure either through cooperative efforts or cooperative sector intervention however this may increase the cost of milk at the present yield level besides this is beyond the financial capability for most of thecattle owners as they have only one or two milking animals similar measures have been prescribed for agroprocessing the sanitary and phyto sanitary measures in an explicit manner came into force as an integral part of the agreement on agriculture the indian exporters of foods items have faced standarddivide in a stringent manner since the wtos agreement of sps measures came into force in 1995 the sps measurers are aimed to protect the human animal or plant life or health in such manner that the scientific merit is not compromised george 2003 technical barrier to trade tbt other specific types of provisions are technical barriers to t rade tbt which focus on ensuring that the imported products satisfy domestic tastes preferences and requirements with respect to quality safety or appropriate considerations of environmental concerns during the manufacture packaging andor shipment of the products the tbt agreement covers all technical regulations voluntary standardsand conformity assessment procedures the legitimate objective of tbt includes national security39requirements and prevention of deceptive practices taking into account the risks that nonfulfillment would create smita 2001 in addition to these objectives another potential objective of the tbt could be simple protection of domestic dairy sector and markets from foreign competitions for instance some countries apply different standards for a given product in different regions of the country which complicates andconfuses the efforts by exporters trying to enter their markets canada is certainly guilty of this with respect to its regulations regarding the colouring of margarine and its blending with buttar one tbt relevance for dairy products could be related to shelf life restrictions south korea for example had uniform government mandated shelf life standards but on being questioned about theirscientific basis by usa agreed to change its policies regarding shelf life in a negotiated settlement thus tbt can result in a net loss causing significance and unnecessary costs to the exporters there is a need for equivalency provisions for standards to balance the interests and rights of exporting countries with the needs and expectations of consumers of importing countries special safeguard provisions ssg the infamous ssg can limit access of indian dairy products provides for imposition of additional import duty of the import exceed their average during the three preceding years by no more than 5 percent during 199598 the 175 percent of the cases in which ssg was invoked were dairy products the tarification of nontariff barriers under the wto has forced india to bind the import of milk powder at zero duty this was primarily because milk powder import had so far remained on therestricted list and therefore was devoid of any nontariff barriers or what is known as quantitative restrictions qrs in comparison new zealand imposes a 12 per cent import duty and the united states and the european union have bound duties at a specific rate of 865 and 1188 per tonnerespectively the import of milk powder from denmark into india was for instance contracted at 1400 per tonne even as the us and the eu are providing a subsidy of 1028 and 959 per tonne of subsidy the import price with the subsidy builtin is substantially lower than the cost of productionin india the logic behind allowing mncs to import milk powder without countervailing duties is difficult to fathom when their own governments are giving them massive subsidies the producer subsidy equivalent which measures the aggregate quantum of subsidy as a percentage of the value of the milkproduced in 1997 stood at 82 per cent in japan 59 per cent in canada 54 per cent in the european union 47 per cent in the us and 23 per cent in australia furthermore the per tonne subsidy of 811 for milk powder declared by the eu in 1998 or the 875 per tonne subsidy provided by the usunder its dairy export incentive programme constituted roughly 55 per cent of the prevailing international price of 1500 per tonne the same year40impact on agro processing and household industries and erosion of womens livelihood following few examples of shri mahila udyog lijjat padap bikaneri bhujia and oil ghanes are more than suffice to show the devasting impact of sps tbt and spg in the livelihood of women shri mahila griha udyog lijjat papad there have been a number of specific grass roots movements in which women from lower middle class have been an active agent of their empowerment for instance the growth and significance of shri mahila griha udyog lijjat papad started by only seven women in march 1959 in girgaum athickly populated area in south mumbai these women belonged to the lohana community mostly of peasants origin hailing from gujarat in fact these women were friends purchased this venture of another woman along with its loss of rs 80 with the needed ingredients from their homes they rolledout papads on the terrace of their buildings ramanathan 2004 with in three months there were about 25 women working in their group in two years the number rose to over 150 women by 196263 the annual sales of papad rose to about rs 182 lakhs in july 1966 this organization of shri mahila udyog lijjat papad was registered as a society under thesocieties act in september 1996 the chairman of khadi and village industries commission kvic government of india personally visited this organization and granted a formal recognition kvic also granted a working capital of about rs 8 lakh and tax exemption and soon it was registered undermumbai trust act 1950 as a public trust thus the formal organization of shri mahila udyog lijjat papad was completed by the seventh year of its existence the organization aimed at promoting selfemployment dignity of labour and earning capacity of women working from home with time this was to be consciously developed as a discourse andideology based on mahatma gandhis concept of trusteeship gandhian trusteeship was well suited to the organization as it had evolved in due course under trusteeship all assets belonged to the society and business was nothing but a refined form of service ownership of a business developed on thoseengaged in its functioning in other words there were to be no employee or employer as most of them came from the lowest economic sections of the society this developed in them a sense of selfesteem and gave them pride in their capacity to earn their livelihood independently thus lajjat as it evolved was very much more than a mere entrepreneurial venture it was a symbolof womens strength as its logo proclaimed a living example of a concept and a way of life at its core were women helping themselves to grow beyond the confines of their home as well as of their work this is an example of how meeting a practical need for supplementary income had a transformatorypotential for the women concerned the pace of growth of the organization is evidenced in the opening of several branches in different parts of india the 21st branch was inaugurated at bhopal madhya pradesh in november 1979 50th branch at borivalli in march 1996 55th branch in baroda gujarat in april 1997 59thbranch in rahuri maharashtra in december 1998 and 61st branch in veerayatan rajgir in bihar in41december 1998 the 62nd branch opened in jammu and kashmir in 2001 since 1998 the opening of new branches was slackened to concentrate on increase of production in the existing center to avoid overlapping of the territorial spread of each branch apart from making papads the organization soon started to diversify into allied or other areas of production that seems feasible as a cottage industry the flourmills in 1975 to grind lentils etcmasalas spices division in 1976 printing division in 1977 and polypropylene packing division in 1978 the cottage leather division 1979 the match industry division in 1979 and agarbatti incense sticks were started but eventually had to close down as they were neither economically viable nor selfsustaining the mahila griha udyog lijjat papad had thus expanded to have 32 divisions and 62 branches the other divisions are sales export advertising printing and polypropylene the branches and other divisions spread over 15 states of india with mumbai itself having 17 branches the strength ofmembersisters swelled to more than 40000 from the original the tremendous increase in the sales proceeds in about a decade was indicative of the corresponding growth and spread of the organization the total sales figures of the organization for the 12 month till february 1980 was rs 4 million thecorresponding sale for the financial year 1999 was rs 25866 million including the export sale of rs 85 million once wellestablished lijjat attracted attention due to its unique equitable structure and rapid development several foreign visitors and officials thronged to see its functioning to promote similarorganization in their countries visitors came from far and wide from israel uk srilanka sudan iraq and other countries the lijjat exports to all these and other countries had a hand in the increasing popularity of its name and products both in the east and the west the growth of the lijjat papad is to be seen in the larger canvas of women and their development within the framework of progress in india the contribution of lijjat in promoting economic empowerment of women has been well recognized and appreciated the economic times award for the business women of the year was received in september 2002 by jaswantiben popat the only surviving memberof the seven women member founder of the lijjat the award was given for the women behind lijjat papad for unleashing the power of unity for building an enduring and respected brand showing that the ordinary women can achieve the extraordinary in the later half of the 20th century women initiated movements that were economic social political or cultural in content shri mahila griha udyog lijjat papad was a model attempt to make women economically self reliant thus paving way for their concurrent empowerment in the other facets of their lives it symbolized the beginning of a slow but steady process of women taking an activeagency over their lives and that of society around them what is significant is that lijjat papad provided a beacon light to the lower class women in india irrespective of their caste religion and region a path towards a better future the capacity to earn ones livelihood and the resultant selfconfidence was necessary the first step in the ladder to empowerment ramanathan 200442women the food processors 43bikaneri bhujia cultural and intellectual piracy by pepsi an example of the free usurpation of a traditional name for a cottage industry product is the recent flooding of delhi bill boards and banners with advertisement by pepsi for bikaneri bhujia pepsi will now be selling bhujia under its brand name lehar namkeen a global company is thus taking control of the traditional snack food sector the famous bhujia of bikaner was developed by a local halwai when in 1877 the then ruler of bikaner maharaja dungar singh asked him to prepare new namkeen for his guests the halwai produced hair thin bhujia which became instantly popular there are now 200 units manufacturing the bhujia the moth dal the basic ingredient grows only in bikaner a product of a local traditional innovation is now to be manufactured and marketed under the brand name of a multinational pepsi will be adding consumer value by providing authentic tasting products with guarantee of quality and freshness at reasonable prices delivered at the doorsteps of the consumers as the worlds largest manufacturer of snacks pepsi sees an opportunity of upgradingthe industry with infusion of technology and would like to see the imagery of namkeens changed from cottage sector produced commodity type product to a modern high quality product which is in line with international standards lehar namkeen thus uses the imagery and technology of the bikaner bhujia even while undermining its cultural technological and socioeconomic base the small cottage industry based units will thus be wiped out as their market will be monopolized by the global snack food giant bhujia will be disassociated from its cultural and ecological roots in bikaner and in the smallscalesnack food sector and will be associated with pepsi in the minds of global consumers through pepsis massive advertising already delhi is getting covered with billboards asking sir do you want same bhujia or using popular popular film songs to say mere pua ghar laya bhikaner bhujia and khata rahe mere dil while art 8 and 299 of t rade mark with their broad scope would be able to prevent any indian citizen from doing what pepsi has done with pepsis signs symbols and marks pepsi is free to pirate and distort the collective heritage of indian society because our heritage cannot be narrowed to a registered trade mark the cultural and economic implications of a multinational corporation taking over a traditional product and selling it globally under its brand name that is illustrated in the pepsi case is at the heart of the political and economic issues of intellectual property rights in general and a t rade marks regime in particular when new ipr regimes are introduced in a technologically and culturally pluraleconomy of india which has not been crushed by formalization of law but governed by customary codes and moral law we have to ensure that changes introduced into our national laws in the context of globalisation have the mechanisms for preventing piracy this includes biopiracy as in the case44of neem patents or seed patents and breeders rights and cultural piracy and intellectual piracy as in the case of bikaner bhujia whether it is farmers right to seed or traditional halwais to produce bikaner bhujia whether it is our biological wealth or our rich craft tradition the protection of the livelihoods of our people and of our cultural values and heritage should be the top most priority of any process of law making evenin the gatt era since trade marks are an economic instrument with major cultural and political impact it is important that a new trade mark bill ensures that it protects our cultural and intellectual heritage as well as the economic base of survival of millions of small producers especially those in the cottageindustry sector the section on textiles is also totally inadequate in protecting the rights and markets of traditional weavers and seems to be drafted only for the industrial sector this is particularly important given that traditional techniques and designs are now being pirated on a large scale by western corporationsfor global markets a major case has emerged in ghana where traditional designs woven by hand loom weavers are being imitated by us textile corporations usurping the american markets from ghanian weavers and undermining the existing african markets to which they currently supply goods further these groups of producers have values of free sharing that need to be protected for the future of humanity as a whole instead of expanding the sphere of privatizing iprs to cover seeds and traditional snack foods it is essential to reduce the sphere of iprs like patents and trade marks in domains where they can infringe on the prior even though nonformalized and nonregistered rightsof farmers healers and handicraft producers protecting the rights of traditional communities has to be ensured by not allowing mncs to have the unbounded intellectual property rights that would allow them to trample on indian producers traders and consumers the traditional farmers and the halwais can best be protected by having veryclearly defined limits and boundaries for corporate rights and having very clear criteria for exclusion in patents as well as in trade marks based on ethical cultural ecological economic and political imperatives bikaneri bhujia is a traditional snack produced in cottage industries in bikaner rajasthan india and currently providing 2500500 persons mainly women with a living wage pepsi with its capital is now using this traditional name in its advertising in order to underbid the local producers and therefore destroy their market pepsi has introduced no new technology to produce this snack thisus mnc which can now operate freely in india after the economic liberalization has appropriated the cultural knowledge the traditional method of food preparation of millions of simple women and thereby destroyed their basis of living these women from town and country educated and uneducatedmarried and widowed had an income from this cottage industry which was perfectly suited to the region which gave this snack its name the moth lentil used for preparing this snack grows only in45the deserts of bikaner and jodhpur the cottage industry had a secure local market and supported not only the women but also the farmers in this desert region where not much else grows a further ten thousand women are employed in the preparation of papad a snack that is eaten together with the bikaneri bhujias and hundreds of thousands of street vendors live from the sales of these populartraditional snacks maria at the conference on intellectual property rights community rights and biodiversity in delhi it was reported that almost the entire population of bikaner was involved in the production and distribution of bikaneri bhujia now pepsi has announced that it will remove this product from thecottage industry sector land relocate it in the hightech sector this will be catastrophe for the people of bikaner as pepsi has stolen the traditional trademark name in order to destroy the market of the little people in india in support of these policies farmland necessary for the feeding of the local population is now planted with export food products such as tomatoes for ketchup from pepsi in place of rice in the punjab sunflowers instead of rice and millet in karnataka flowers strawberries and fruits for export in maharashtra instead of basic food stuffs corn is grown for animal feed to be exported toeurope the large food concerns turn the farmers into contract producers who provide them with raw materials for the manufacture of novel food which they then sell where certain social classes have the necessary purchasing power the attack on local processing the threat to our ghanis chakkis and dhabas global agribusiness is now attempting to take over food processing by making fresh locally produced food appear backward and stale food clothed in aluminum and plastic appear modern industrial processing and packaging was first applied to edible oils destroying the livelihood of oil mill operators and small farmers because of imported soybeans an attempt is now being made to takeover the wheat economy the indian wheat economy is based on decentralized smallscale local production processing and distribution systems wheat and flour atta provide livelihoods and nutrition to millions of farmers traders artis and local mill operators chakkiwallas the decentralized smallscale household basedeconomy of food production and food processing is huge in aggregate it generates millions of livelihoods while ensuring that fresh and wholesome food at accessible prices is available to people moreover such production and processing has no negative environmental impacts it is estimated that more than 35 million familyrun kirana shops supply wheat to indian consumers more than 2 million small neighborhood mills produce fresh flour in addition flour is also produced by million of women working at the household level the rolling pin belan for making rotis has always been a symbol of womens power it is often mistakenly said that only 2 percent of foodis processed in india this is because officials ignore womens work in the home and the contribution of this work to the national economy46while 40 million tonnes of wheat is traded only 15 million tonnes is purchased directly as atta because india loves freshness and quality in food less than one percent of consumed atta caries a brand name because indian consumers trust their own supervision of quality at the local chakki better than a brand name attached to stale packaged flour this decentralized smallscale economy basedon millions of producers processors and traders works with very little capital and very little infrastructure people are the substitute for capital and infrastructure however such a people centered economy impedes largescale profits for big agribusiness they are therefore eyeing the indian wheat economyto transform it into a source of profits the destruction of millions of livelihood of local decentralized economy and of peoples access to fresh and cheap atta is described as modernization of the food chain in the third world packaged food is described as the food of the rich even though the rich in the industrialized countries in facteat fresh food while the poor are forced to eat heavily processed and packaged food packaging is not modernization but rather an obsolete aspect of nonsustainable economy that uses packaging and brand names as a way to displace the more efficient and cheaper system through which peoplecan get food processed locally in front of their eyes and hence ensure quality and freshness the delhi government has also passed a law requiring all small dhabas and street vendors to get licenses while economic reforms have ended the license permit raj for big corporations and mncs globalisation is creating a new rule of license and corruption by dragging the small farmerssmall processors into a net of a licensepermit raj this is a system of slavery not free trade free trade is what we have had the freedom to practice our trade at the small scale whether it is to put up a tea stall or dhaba or the roadside or a small chakki or ghani in a village and community agriculture is the basis of our survival our culture and our moral fabric destruction of indian agriculture by import dumping and take over of indian agriculture by mncs through wto trade rules an world bankimf policies of economic reform is not just the destruction of the livelihoods of 750 million indians who are farmers it is an assault on our freedom and democracy it is an invasion intoour culture and civilization it is a threat to our environment and food security it is a recipe for a new slavery in which the farmers and the country are enslaved to american mncs the american government and the world bank imf and wto a new freedom movement for india has to be based on a movement for farmers freedom we have to keep our food and agriculture free of mnc control and wtq control unless our food and agriculture is based on policies that defend nation and sovereignty and farmers sovereignty we all once again be colonized and enslaved agreement on agriculture aoa worst of all agriculture the last bastion of the national economy is facing unprecedented threat with the removal of all quantitative restriction qr on imports of agricultural products on the one hand and impending corporatisation of this sector on the other the damage has been compounded47because of the complementary economic financial and fiscal policies being followed by the government and advice of imf and world bank farmers have been left to the mercy of the traders and profiteers they are being dispossessed of their land through auctions to recover the dues public distribution system has been decimated in the name of targeting subsidies and fiscal discipline following the wto treaty india has liberized its agricultural trade policy by removing all quantitative restrictions on imports of agricultural commodities and export of major commodities there has been tarification of erstwhile nontariff items and wto compatible tariff rates prevail at the time of signing the aoa in 1994 it was hoped that indian farmers would gain substantially from trade liberalization as our farmers would gain international market access for their productsthis was mainly because international price at the point of time were much higher than domestic prices of most agricultural commodities however in the wake of wto indias exports of almost all agricultural commodities have sown a declining trend due to low tariff imports of edible oils particularlypalm oil have surged which have depressed the domestic prices of edible oils and oilseeds as a result indian farmers have suffered a great deal also the country imports edible oils to the tune of 46 lakh tonnes and spends huge foreign exchange there is no level playing field created through aoa or wto led trade liberalization and therefore where is the question of small and marginal farmers in india benefiting from such unequal open trade regime in other wordsthe existing aoa is heavily biased in favour of developed countries besides even if indian farmers are led to freely decide what they should produce or should not produce fordomestic and international markets based on comparison with world market prices of the principle of comparative advantage they will not gain much mileage because of two reasons first the world market for agricultural commodities lack objectivity as these are largely controlled by a few oligopolistsand multinational companies who account for agreements among them and consequently free trade will remain a myth second small and marginal farmers in india lack adequate access to marketing facilities even within the country due to lack of access to basic infrastructure like market yards within a reasonabledistance roads and transportation storage cool chains etc and therefore depend heavily on unscrupulous middleman in other words benefits of trade if any whether nationally or internationally would be cornered moreover in a country like india where there is huge population indian farmers can substantiallybenefit from domestic market alone provided there is sufficient improvement in purchasing power of the people and necessary marketing infrastructure in fact enabling the small farmers to benefit from development of domestic market would be a necessary precondition for their gainful access to internationalmarkets as the same time it is apprehended that the process of economic liberalization will ultimately yield a situation in which multinational companies will dominate the agricultural scene in india and small farmers may lose their grips over agriculture posing a risk of livelihood insecurity for millionsof people reddy 1997 also trips and biopiracy are likely to affect the indian farmers adversely48already several traditional indian products like kalajjra karela brinjal and anar are reported to have been patended in foreign countries although india has won cases for basmati and neem in addition the monopolisticoligopolistic seed production by multinational companies would tend to raise input prices thus rising the farmers cost of production wtos agreement on agriculture had incorporated three broad areas of commitments from member states namely in market access domestic support and export subsidies increased market access was the hallmark of the free trade aimed at opening new markets for agriculture exporters there has however been hardly any change in the volume of exports high imports duties continueto block exports from the developing countries have also blocked the exports from developing countries and on top of it only 36 countries all developed have the right to impose special safeguard provision if agriculture imports distort their domestic market the underlying objective being to correct andprevent restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets on the other hand the trading regime has ensured that developing countries take timebound initiatives to open up their domestic markets for cheap and highly subsidized imports of agricultural commodities in the name of encouragingcompetition nine years later it is now established that these measures have only protected the farmers and the farming systems of the developed countries it is now official nine years after the wto came into existence on january 1 1995 the anticipated gains for india from the trade liberalization process in agriculture are practically zero theministries of agriculture and commerce have officially admitted that the hopes from an international regime that talked of establishing a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system have been belied market access increased market access was the hallmark of the free trade agenda it was aimed at force opening new markets for agriculture exporters the aoa required all countries to allow a certain minimum market access for every agricultural product at 5 percent for developed countries and 4 percent for developing countries southern nations with low cost of production were always told thatwith the developed countries would have to open up their markets for cheaper food imports as a result of which the developing countries would gain enormously india was forced to either phase out or eliminate the quantitative restrictions qrs on agricultural commodities and products latest by april 1 2001 india has therefore opened its market and in turnmade the farming community vulnerable to the imports of highly subsidized products already cheaper imports of skimmed milk powder edible oils sugar tea are canut apples coconut etc have flooded the market domestic support clever manipulation of their subsidyreduction commitments has in reality increased the support to farmers in the developed countries in the us subsidy to mere 900000 farmers has increased by49700 times since 1996 t wo years before the former us president mr bill clinton left the office the us had provided an additional 26 billion to its farmers in absolute terms farm support in the oecd countries increased 8 percent to reach a staggering 363 billion in 1998 in the european union eu direct payments to farmers after the reforms initiated in march 1999 to the common agricultural policy now account for 126 percent of the net income of cerealproducers and 129 percent for the bovine meat producers and this falls under the blue box explicit and implicit support to farmers is therefore protected under the various colours of the protection boxes green box amber box and blue box in india we are being told that our aggregate measure of support ams a measure of the subsidies that are provided to agriculture being negative against the upper limit of ten percent we can still raise our subsidies to farmers in reality india is committed to do away with agricultural subsidies under the structural adjustment programme of the world bank and the imf in any caseindia provides only 1 billion worth of indirect subsidies to 550 billion farmers it was anticipated that due to reduction in domestic support in the developed countries cereal production would shift from the developed to the developing countries empirical evidence however is that such a trend is not at all visible in fact all indications and efforts of the world bankimfpoint towards making the developed countries the hub of cereal production the brettea woods institutions have been asking developing countries to diversify to cash crops as a precondition for advancing loans moreover with such massive subsidies intact and with the ors lifted developingcountries are sure to be inundated with food imports a process that has already initiated further marginalisation of farming and farm communities export subsidies the wto enables only 25 countries to provide export subsidies for their agricultural products and commodities other countries which do not have agricultural export subsidies like india cannotmake any new provisions for it export subsidies that need to be pruned as per a formula are not provided in india on the other hand the us continues to find legitimacy for even export credits which are actually used to promote and push american agricultural exports the ministry of agriculture acknowledges that despite the rules being defined the expected gains have eluded the developing countries it was expected that with the removal of trade distorting measures agricultural exports from the developing countries would increase this did not happen in fact india has on the other hand seen a massive increase in the imports of agricultural commoditiesand products from rs 5000 crore in 1995 to over rs 15000 crore in 19992000 a threefold increase in edible oils alone the import bill has soared to rs 9000 crore the socalled fair trading system has also not helped efficient producers in realizing a higher price for their products on thecontrary prices of most agricultural commodities are declining in world market50agreement on agriculture a kargil treaty the agreement on agriculture should be called a kargil agreement converting selfsufficient food dependent economies is the kargil vision and the wt o strategy because the agriculture agreement of wto is an agribusiness treaty it distorts production and trade from the perspective of nature small farmers and all consumers especially the poor it is a recipe for ecological destruction devastationof family farms and rumination of citizens health behind the apparent neutrality of rules for domestic support market access and export competition are distorted assumptions and myths about food production and distribution vandana shiva 2003 these kargil myths are enshrined in the wt o agriculture agreements the first myth is that america is the best region for growing food and america grows the best food the reality is that america is a model of how not to grow and produce food the second myth is that free trade allows food to be delivered efficiently the reality is that without massive subsidies and dumping uscorporations could not capture south markets and free trade is based on a food swap with countries importing and exporting the same commodity and all countries pushed into trade in a handful of commodities controlled by the agribusiness giantsnot on exporting what a country can uniquelyproduce and importing what it cannot the related myth is that dumping frees up incomes of farmers who can then buy motorbikes cellular phones and computers the reality is that dumping destroys domestic markets collapse of markets destroys livelihoods and incomes collapse of rural incomes erodes purchasing power andentitlements impoverished farmers join the ranks of the hungry indebted farmers commit suicide starvation deaths and farm suicides are the tragic outcome of trade liberalization of food systems while displacing farmers has been justified on grounds of productivity in fact small farms are more productive than large ones as our former prime minister ch charan singh had stated agriculture being a life process in actual practise under given conditions yields per acre decline as the size of farm increase in other words as the application of human labour and supervision per acre decreases the above results are well nigh universal output per acre of investment is higher on small farmers than on large farms thus if a crowded capitalscare country like india has a choice betweena single 100 acre farm and forty 25 acre farms the capital cost to the national economy will be less if the country chooses the small farms however it is the small farms and small farmers who are being destroyed by globalization and trade driven economic reforms five million peasants livelihoods have disappeared in india sincereforms were introduced change in agricultural production and erosion of agricultural livelihood there are two levels at which the matter of food selfsufficiency based on the green revolution in india is a myth at the micro level the displacement of crop mixtures of cereals pulses and oilseeds51by monocultures of commoditised hyv crops undermines food selfsufficiency in a drastic way first the small peasant who does not fit into the credit purchased inputs and cash crop package is displaced losing his or her entitlement to food that food production provided there is ample evidence available that the green revolution had a class bias and worked against the interests of the smallpeasant the dispossession of the poorer sections of rural society through the green revolution strategy and their reduced access to food resources is in part responsible for the appearance of surpluses at the macrolevel the surplus according to prominent economist v krv rao is a myth because it iscreated by lack of purchasing power the green revolution has displaced not just seed varieties but entire crops in the third world just as peoples seeds were declared primitive and inferior by the green revolution ideology food crops were declared marginal inferior and coarse grained only a biased agricultural sciencerooted in capitalist patriarchy could declare nutritious crops like ragi and jowar inferior peasant women know the nutrition needs of their families and the nutritive content of the crops they grow among food crops they prefer those with maximum nutrition to those with a value in the market whathave usually been called marginal crops or coarse grains are natures most productive crops in terms of nutrition that is why women in garhwal continue to cultivate mandua and women in karnataka cultivate ragi inspite of all attempts by state policy to shift to cash crops and commercial food grains to whichall financial incentives of agricultural development are tied table 31 illustrates how what the green revolution has declared inferior grains are actually superior in nutritive content to the socalled superior grains rice and wheat a woman in himalayan village once told without our mandua and jbangorawe could not labour as we do these grains are our source of health and strength shiva 1992 table 13 1 nutritional content of different food crops protein minerals ca fe gms 100 gms mg 100 gms bajira 116 23 42 50 ragi 73 27 344 64 jowar 104 16 25 58 wheat milled 118 06 23 25 rice milled 68 06 10 31 shiva 1992 the most extreme example of this polarized vision is that of bathua an important green leafy vegetable with very high nutritive value which grows as an associate of wheat when women weed the wheat field they do not merely contribute to the productivity of wheat they actually harvest a rich source of nutrition for their families however with intensive chemical fertilizer use bathua becomes52a major competitor of wheat and has been declared a weed that is killed with herbicides and weedicides the food cycle is broken women are deprived of work and children are deprived of a free source of nutrition the crops that the green revolution destroys are thus not marginal in the context of nutrition and survival but in the context of the market and of commodity production of food forprofit the bias against peoples seeds and peoples crops translates into a bias against womens work in the production of sustenance since diversity works against the logic of centralization and control genetic diversity must be destroyed in effect global agricultural strategies are breeding out those links in the food chain whichare of high value of womens work in the survival economy and which have traditionally been under their control the green revolution in punjab reduced food values by displacing the traditional cereal pulse oilseed mixed cropping patterns and reducing the production of pulses and oilseeds the rapidspread of hyv rice and wheat took place at the cost of pulses and oilseeds shiva 1992 women in india are an intimate part of nature both in imagination and in practice at one level nature is symbolized as the embodiment of the feminine principle and at another she is nurtured by the feminine to produce life and provide sustenance with the violation of nature is linked the violationand marginalisation of women especially in the third world women produce and reproduce life not merely biologically but also through their social role in providing sustenance women were the worlds original food producers and continue to be central to food production system in the third world in terms of the work they do in the food chain the worldwide destructionof the feminine knowledge of agriculture evolved over four to five thousand years by a handful of white male scientists in less than two decades has not merely violated women as experts since their expertise in agriculture has been related to modeling agriculture on natures methods of renewabilityits destruction has gone hand in hand with the eco logical destruction of natures processes and the economic destruction of the poorer people in rural areas shiva 1992 contrary to received views that modernization would liberate women from old discrimination and domination the modernization of agriculture in india is deepening old prejudices and introducing newbiases and violence the assumption of the substitutability and dispensability of nature and women that results from the dichotomies and dualisms of economic and scientific reductionism is the underlying cause for the desertification and death of soils on the one hand and the deprivation devaluation anddeath of women on the other shiva 1992 trade related intellectual property rights trips the trade related intellectual property rights agreement trips of wto is the aspect of globalization which can be the biggest threat to peoples food security when combined with the opening up of the seed industry the section of trips that most directly affects farmers rights and agricultural biodiversity is article 2753b which states vandana shiva and anjali 200253parties may exclude from patentability plants and animals other than microorganisms and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than nonbiological and microbiological processes however parties shall provide for the protection of plant varieties either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or by any combination thereof this provision shallbe reviewed four years after the entry into force of the agreement establishing the wto the article thus allows two forms of iprs in plants patents and a sui generis system the patent act and the national plant variety legislation drafts are becoming a major location of contest between the public interest and corporate interest the 1970 patent act excluded all methods of agriculture and horticulture from patentability in addition the exclusion of product patents in the area of agrochemicals was also ensured through section 5a the patent amendment bill 1995 removes these restrictions in the field of agriculture further since it does not articulate new demarcation criteria for exclusions it allows the patenting ofplants plant products plant characteristics their genes biopesticides biofertilisers etc the totally unrestricted scope of patenting in agriculture that this bill proposed would have undermined indian agriculture threatened indian farmers and imperiled food security it failed to pass through parliamentdue to these serious implications the trips agreements militate against peoples human right to food and health by conferring unrestricted monopoly rights to corporations in the vital sectors of health and agriculture it also threatens the livelihood of farmers the case of the basmati patents is a good illustration of howintellectual property rights iprs claimed by corporations undermines farmers rights basmati is a rice variety evolved over centuries of breeding by indian farmers the us company rice tec has patent no 56 63 484 for basmati 867 which is essentially derived from indian basmati but which rice t ec claims is an instant invention of novel rice lines the patent claim thus denies farmers breeding and innovation and by appropriating the contribution of farmers declares biopiracy as an invention over time rice tec can use the patent to prevent indian farmers from growing basmati or force them to pay royalties since a patent allows the patent holder to exclude others from making or using the product covered by a patent in the short run ricet ec can use biopiracy to undermine indias markets of basmati exports of 400000500000 tons valued at rs112 billion which commands threefourth of the total rice exports intellectual property rights in the area of agriculture and plant variety will undermine food security since the protected and patented varieties are not linked to food needs but to the processingand marketing requirements of agribusiness the shift to the control of agriculture through the control of seed will also contribute to secondary impacts on other natural resources like land and water passing into the control of tncs iprs in the area of seeds and plants will increase the national debttenfold54article 2753 b of the trips agreement is based on allowing the patenting of life forms by discriminating between biological and nonbiological forms since such discrimination already exists the agreement in agriculture should be reviewed on the basis of discrimination between the small family farm and the large corporate farm and discrimination between ecologicalorganic agricultureand chemicalgenetically engineered agriculture us industry tried to preempt such discrimination which is necessary for food security by insisting that genetic engineering be labeled organic however without protecting the earth biodiversity and the smallfarmer no food security is possible hence the right to life and the right to food security require that the wto agreement bechanged to provide protection to small producers and to the environment trade policy needs to be guided by human rights and by environmental concerns the human rights of farmers and poor consumers cannot be sacrificed merely for the increased profits of global commerce discriminationbetween sustainable and nonsustainable systems between just and unjust systems between ethical and unethical farming is necessary to ensure future survival the myth that has supported globalization is that it will lead to growth but what is never specified is growth of what and for whom trade liberalization does lead to growth of profits for globalagribusiness corporations but it is leading to a decline in food production and food security and the erosion of ecological security and economic security for farmers globalization of agriculture can neither provide food security nor sustainability sustainability of agriculture and the right to food requires an alternative to the external intensification and externalliberalization of agriculture internal intensification creates conditions for internal liberalization the green revolution model and now the globalization model of agriculture are based on the destruction of diversity uprooting of small peasants through indebtedness chemical intensification capital intensification centralisation and long distance transport they are based on the intensificationof external inputs and integration with global markets the alternative to both the green revolution and globalization is the biodiversity intensification of farming which can only be done on small farms biodiversity intensification leads to internal intensification and internal integration of farms with diverse local markets this is the real liberalizationof agriculture since it frees the earth from the violence of agrochemicals it frees diverse species from the assault of poisons and toxins it frees the farmer of bondage through debt and royalties it frees the indian consumer from having to compete with global agribusiness to get access and entitlementto food for both sustainability and justice the alternative based on internal intensification and internal liberalization is essential under gatt article vi a government that was found to be injured by the dumping of overly cheap goods can offset the economic damage by charging countervailing duties on them at the borderbut antidumping duties on agricultural products have never been assessed in part because the protocol for provisional acceptance permitted countries to continue pregatt policies and in part55because the governments often benefited from the opportunity to distribute cheap foods while the actually injured parties were peasants with little political clout the gatts provisions for antidumping have been widely applied in disputes over trade in industrial goods patents on seeds biopiracy and seed monopolies seed security is the foundation of food security through their operations the multinational corporations mncs usurp from sovereign nation states the power of seed production distribution and supply sovereignty implies selfgovernance having freedom of choice and autonomy of decisionmaking freedom struggle against colonial was fought for sovereignty today the same is threatened by neocolonialism which manifests it self in the growing influence of a handful mnc and governments that harbour them more than 60 crores indians are dependent either directly or indirectly on agriculturewhich contribute rs 418 lac crores to the gdp quality seed is the foundation for indian agriculture and therefore can better the lives of 60 crores ind1ans in the words of dr mv rao one of the eminent scientists behind the green revolution in india the agriculture of any country will be asstrong as its seeds programme if the seed programmes are weak the agriculture is weak and if the agriculture is weak the nation is weak rao 2004 by being able to control that grows and eats what and in how much quantity it finally means be1ng 1n charge of peoples lives and livelihoods from the sowing to the harvesting if an mnc 1sunder protection from national and international law and policy then the sovereignty of peoples agriculture is severely at risk for instance if a seed company is able to ensure that there is no other way that a farmer can resow a particular crop but by repeatedly procuring the seed from them the farmer is made dependanton the company traditionally a farmer would have been to generate the seeds for the next crops from the produce of the present one the customary rights of farmers to save use exchange and sell seed and other planting material are the foundation of agriculture it also enables them to continue thedevelopment and transfer of their biodiversity and indigenous knowledge and practices the current intellectual property system allows mncs to have exclusive rights over the planting material so that they control it this has disastrous implications for farmers since for the first time in history they are losing control of the foundation of their livelihood the seed keeping seed freeis critical to guaranteeing food sovereignty the simple act of seed saving has been accepted as a natural gift of the farmers in the present situation this and several other farmers rights are threatened for food sovereignty to be guaranteed seed and agriculture has to be under local control of those who have made it possible in the first placethis requires governments to facilitate farmercentered and peoples agriculture genetic engineered seeds reduce biodiversity and negate local and national control over food productions it is essential that communities maintain sovereignty over their own systems of food production distribution and supply in most local communities food security depends pr1marily on the knowledge56and activities of women the mechanization of agriculture and emphasis on cash crops marginalize women and irreversibly erodes the knowledge control and hence autonomy of traditional livelihood system bhutani 2004 a strong local management and a large biodiversity base provide the best insurance for both food security and political stability agrobiodiversity can only be assured if the peoples vast andvaried traditional knowledge base is guaranteed an enabling environment to survive and thrive it is critical that agricultural policy objectives such as food sovereignty and seeds are put first and trade rules subject to them and not viceversa seeds are the most important component of agriculture productivity and a striking symbol of agricultural research as it contains embodied technology in india both private and public sector plays commendable role in seed production and its distribution but the composition of the private and public sector differs widely with the private sector mainly concentrating on the high value seed like vegetableswhereas the public sector mainly concentrates on the production of high volume low value seeds like cereals in india national seed corporation nsc established in 1963 had played a prominent role in green revolution by engaging on production and distribution of seeds suresh and chand 2004 theindian seed industry besides providing the quality seeds to the farmers at the affordable prices has been responsible for employment generation in rural sector and the growing rural economy in crops like cotton maize sunflower etc where the hybrids are popular the employment generation is estimatedto be above 800870 lacs man days per annum the magnitude of the employment potential that 100 in the rural area which have less employment potential than urban areas underlines the significant contribution of the seed industry in our country rao 2004 at present farmers use saved seeds of a particular variety for growing subsequent crops either on his own land or on leased land or by traditional exchange of seeds in the village community once he converts into commercial seed sector he is not permitted to sell the seeds of protected varieties without prior permission and he can be booked for breaching the ipr norms in that case the marketsize of public sector in seed industry increased in absolute terms during the period of 199495 to 199899 the share of public sector declined from 40 percent to 25 percent during the same period similarly the share of unorganized private sector has increased to 60 percent from 35 percent theseed market in india has seen an upsurge from rs 2000 crores in the year 2000 it is estimated to touch rs 6000 crores by the end of the year 2005 deccan herald at present out of the estimated rs 4000 crores turnover in the seed industry about rs 3000 crores is supposed to be from the privatesector it is reported that 92 percent of wheat farmers are using home grown seed for the next seasons crop this is a high as 93 percent for groundnut and 76 percent for rapeseed mustard the role of private sector in the indian seed industry is on the increase the composition of indian seed hasreached a ratio of 6040 between private and public sector57as a result of globalization the indian seed industry has to face the competition from the large global companies as the indigenous seed industry operates with low profile margin and largely depends on technological support of the indian public sector the competition becomes one sided andunequal the large multinationals from the developed countries are in advantage position visvis the indigenous companies due to their 1 very large financial resources and low interest funds 2 t rained manpower to operate in biotech regime3 capacity to invest in biotechnology research under such a situation the indigenous seed industry might collapse in future unless an initiative in the form of technology mission on quality seed to support technically and financially and through a policy is launched by the government the collapse of indigenous seed industry will have a veryadverse impact on indian agriculture and farmers some of the ramifications of the collapse of indigenous seed industry are farmers will have to depend on a few large seed companies for their exclusive technology for basic and vital input like seed leading to consequences like shortages high prices loss of biodiversity the seed prices will go up because of reduced competition cultivation of few hybrids or varieties in a crop across the country could result in pest and disease epidemics this will reduce biodiversity closure of small and medium sized companies native r d may slowly vanish the present level of rural employment due to hybrid seed production may get reduced there is a threat that a few large seed companies with technological edge monopolize the indian seed market looking at such a bleak prospects some of the leading indian seed companies may choose to sell their business at the lucrative prices that may be offered to them by mncs in a state like haryana the structural composition of the seed sector has witnessed significant changes since the formation of wto in the year 19951996 the contribution of government andcooperative sector in the total cereals certified seed in haryana state were 77 and 562 respectively in the year 19901991 and both the sector maintained their consistent contribution up to 19951996 but their share in the total cereals certified diminished rapidly after the establishment of wto in 19951996 and reached nearly 3462 and 418 respectively in the year 19992000 the contribution of private sector in the total cereals certified seed was 1707 in the year 19901991 but its contribution in total cereals certified increased rapidly after the establishment of wto and reached up to 6120 in the year 19992000 kumar chand 200258this reflects that indian seed industry is rapidly moving into a phase of corporate control over seeds after the establishment of wto developments in seed sector proceed either through multinational companies setting up their branches or through collaboration between multinationals and private seed companies under the latter scenario the western collaborator provides technological expertise andinvestment while the private counterpart provides the indian germplasm and a marketing base kumar chand 2002 a debate has also begun on the implications of the international treaty on plant genetic resources on food and agriculture itpgrfa which comes into effect from jun 29 2004 itpgrfa is a binding agreement that gives legal force to the conservation and sustainable use of 64 food crops from 35 genres and 29 forges but the treaty has an ambiguity in article 123d which is being interpreted by countries allowing changes to iprs on changes made to the genetic resources held in the multilateral systemmls this would mean patenting of seeds and restricting farmers access and defeating the basic purpose of the treaty the controversial clause reads as follows recipients shall not claim any intellectual or other rights that limit the facilitated access to the plant genetic resources for food oragriculture or their genetic parts or components from mls there is a fear that unless the ambiguity is removed in the t reaty there will be a lightening of the ipr regime the governing body of the treaty should ensure that both seeds and the genetic resources they contain could not be subjected to iprs the governing council should also ensure thatlegislation to recognize farmers rights is implemented fully in all the countries that have ratified the t reaty there is a necessity for the implementation of the leipzig global plan of action with its ten priority activities negotiated by one hundred and sixty governments in the year 1996 to conservationof crop varieties on farm and the development of the global diversity trust gdt india has enacted the plant varieties protection and farmers rights pvpfr act and the biological diversity bo act well in advance of the implementation of itpgrfa but there are also chances of india modifying its pvpfr and bd act with a view to joining the upw convention of 1991the upw1991 does not recognize farmers rights to save seeds for the next crops if india joins upw 1991 it will sacrifice the interest of the farmers dr asheesh tayal of green peace hopes that treaty should end biopiracy there have been several instances of biopiracy one recent incident is of monsanto taking patent on indian wheatwhich has been challenged by rfste in the supreme court however according to mr bhagirath choudhary of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry ficci the treaty will provide exclusive legal rights to private companies to charge patent loyalties on patented varieties drawn from traditional novel varieties of developing countriesthe export market for important varieties or products made from medicinal plants can be affected by patents owned in foreign countries domestic market could be flooded with patented agricultural59products the collaborative rd projects on plant varieties will diminish access to and transfer of new technologies and improved varieties would be restricted innovative and creative processes of indigenous and local communities can be eroded ipr laws can provide a disincentive to public and private sector scientists overall the treaty may increase the threat to diversity of genetic resources and escalatebiopiracy sharma 2004 international organization that work to eliminate poverty in developing countries say that the t reaty should out law patents on the sixty four major food crops and forages that are listed in the t reaty but the clause which bans patents is open to interpretation it is important that the governingbody should close these loopholes vackayil 2004 the agriculture biodiversity and its components genetic resources for food and agriculture have been developed by the indigenous people tribal and forest dwellers men and women and farmers over the last 12000 years through the free exchange of genetic resources across the globe the scientistswould need genetic diversity in agriculture to face unpredictable environmental and climatic changes in order to select solutions to these there should be genetic diversity however attempts are being made to commercialize them for reopening excessive profits by patenting them for exclusive exploitation indian basmati rice neem turmeric etc are the victims ofsuch global patenting manipulation similarly the integrity of many of these plant varieties is being compromised by genetically modified organisms these developments in the field of plant biotechnology are alienating farmers and ethnic breeding from their own resources vackayil 2004 high yield varieties hyvs or green revolution seeds are misnamed because the term implies that the seeds are high yielding in and of themselves the distinguishing feature of these seeds however is that they are actually high response varieties though these seeds can be saved by farmers they are nonsustainable due to vulnerability to diseases and pests and therefore need to bereplaced after one or two crops hybrid seeds are the first generation seeds f1 produced from crossing two genetically dissimilar parent species the progeny of these seeds cannot economically be saved or replanted as the next generations will give much lower yields the hybrid seeds are also called sarkari seeds as these seeds have initially been developed and distributed by the public sector in india t oday there are three kinds of producers of seeda farmers seeds the farmer has historically been the producer of perennial varieties which could reproduce themselves etemally b public sector seeds public sector research institutions have bred short term varieties for high yield these seeds could for sometime be saved and used by the farmer but theiryield reduces after a few years60c private sector seeds private companies and transnational corporations produce non renewable and therefore nonsustainable seeds through hybrids and tissue culture where the farmer has to return to the company for fresh seed each time he has to sow the last is called biological patenting of seed patents give the owner of the seed the exclusive right to multiply save develop further varieties and sell seeds biological patenting effectively preventsthe farmer from multiplying saving and selling seed the biotechnology revolution which spurs the shifts in indias seed policy differs from the green revolution in terms of corporate control and the control of bioregions the biotechnology revolution is predominantly private in character the green revolution was spearheaded by the internationalagricultural research centers like cimmyt and irri organized by the consultative group on international agricultural research which is controlled by governments private foundations agribusiness corporations and multinational development banks the private corporate interests such as agrochemical and agribusinesstransnational thus functioned through the programme set by public or quasipublic institutions which they could influence and from whose agricultural strategies they stood to gain vandana shiva with the biotechnology revolution the private corporate multinational interest has become the spearheading sector of agricultural policy the pepsico project and the new seed policy signal this newtrend in which the technologies are not transferred from cimmyt or irri to icar or pau and on the farm this time transnational corporate capital will go directly with the latest technology to the remotest farm private interests of profits will thus be the dominant driving force in the biorevolutionincreasing the control of multinationals decreasing the role of governments and citizens of the third world table 13 2 comparing the

exchange and sell seeds among themselves today the farmer saved seed and staterun seed programmes are worth around 22 billion which is almost equal to the 423billion total commercial seed market worldwide the terminator technology which is not yet commercialized in india has as primary aim the maximization of the seed industrys profits by destroying the ability of farmers to save their seeds and breed their own crops genetic seed sterilization goes far beyond intellectual property a typical patent provides an exclusive legal monopoly for 20 years but terminator is a monopoly with no expirationdate it is the perfect tool for the corporate seed industry in a global market because it destroys the concept of national seed sovereignty the false miracle that seed companies are selling with biotechnology and genetic engineering is the possibility of liberating agriculture from chemicals and other ecological risks however most of the seed multinationals are also leading chemical companies these include cibageigy ici monsantoand hoechst the immediate strategy for these companies is to increase the use of pesticides and herbicides by developing pesticide and herbicide tolerant varieties while deepening corporate control of agriculture the biotechnologies also expand the scope for this control while markets for agrochemical inputs and hyv seeds were restricted to regions with irrigation the biorevolution will permit the extension of commercial agriculture to all regions torainfed lands and marginal soils the impacts of the biorevolution thus have the potential to encompass the entire rural populations of the third world transnational will thus gain total market control in a sector around which the life and livelihood of millions of farmers and peasants revolves indigenous breeding through selection has given access to the best seeds to all and the crop itself provides the seed richarias work on conserving indigenous strains has established that by64marinating control over seeds the peasant need not sacrifice in terms of yields the hybrid seed must be bought each year from the seed merchants the genetically engineered seed of the biorevolution will deepen this dependence of peasants on mncs the lab not nature will become the sole source of seeds of the biotechnologies and with labs shifting from universities to the corporate sector fromthe public to the private domain only those who can pay will have a right to seeds globally and nationally food grain production has been dramatically reduced due to ecological instabilities these include drought induced both by climatic change associated with the greenhouse effect and desertification through inappropriate land and water use the momentum of grain productionbetween 1950 and 1984 when world output grew from 624 million tones to 1645 million tones has waned in recent year and may continue to dip further what will be the impact on the availability of staple foods as more and more land is diverted to fruits and vegetables for export at a time when food scarcity is already a reality both nationallyand globally and with the pressure from the world bank and the imf to reduce food subsidies how will the food entitlements of economically and politically weakest groups be protected cash crops especially for export are subject not just to ecological risks but to financial risks as well because cash crops for export do not produce much cash over time the growth of exportoriented cash crop agriculture is a primary reason for africas food crisis the main drawback to cash crops is that over the year they produce less and less cash cash crops are encouraged over food production by an export oriented agriculture policy as the area under commodities for exports growsprices fall and returns decline instead of increasing contracting seed production private sector seed companies produce patent seed and breeder seed on their own farms this is principally for reasons of security farmers are then supplied with foundation seed and produce hybrid seed under contract few company representatives identified landceilings as presenting a problem in seed production this was partly because circumventing restrictions upon land ownership or at least leasing was considered straightforward even in the event of land ceilings being abolished they still envisaged contracting seed production to farmers large areas ofland are required for the production of hybrid seed and it was considered uneconomic to attempt this on corporate owned holdings that land ceilings are not considered an issue by many companies is demonstrated by the ignorance of company representatives of actual land ceilings in andhra pradeshfor example managers estimates of the maximum possible land holding ranged from 45 acres to 550 acres but there is a further incentive for companies to continue contracting seed production to small farmers bd sharma former commissioner commission on schedule cast schedule tribes governmentof india points out that the embodiment of labor in agricultural produce has been devalued by treating family farm labor as of zero value because it is free the whole family at minimal expense whereas on corporate farms management staff would need to be employed at additional expense65great care is exercised over cultivation of small areas of crop by a farmer and his family not least because their very livelihood depends directly upon the productivity of their land the epidemic of farmers suicide is the real barometer of the stress under which indian agriculture and indian farmers have been put buy globalization of agriculture growing indebtedness and increasing crop failure are the main reasons that the farmers have committed suicide across the length andbreath of rural india the suicides by farmers highlights these high social and ecological costs of the globalization of nonsustainable agriculture which are not restricted to the cotton growing areas of these states but have been experienced in all commercially grown and chemically farmed crop in allregions while the benefits of globalization go to the seeds and chemical corporation through expanding markets the cost and risks are exclusively born by the small farmers and landless peasants globalization and privation of the seed sector have eroded farmers seed supply and seed supplied by the public sector while the entry of private seed companies is justified on grounds of increasingfarmers options and choices by making farmers look down on their own varieties as inferior and by eroding the capacity of the public sector globalization has in effect created a seed famine besides putting their own resources the middle and small farmers borrow money paying high interest rates from arthies or private moneylenders who also provide them seeds fertilizers andpesticides on credit the rise of moneylenders is a part of an emerging phenomenon of corporate feudalism withdrawal of low interest credit has been a key element of the world bank led economic reforms women as seed keeper over the centuries women have made great contribution to conserve the seeds even tribal and poor women have been involved to save seeds as amply manifested by the following few examples in jharkhand bhelwara village bishungarh sabitri lives in bhelware a village in bishungarh the next lane is a selfassured smiling young women she has passed class vii and has three sons she knows the names of many old rice strainsthat the village had before her husband ravi shankar mahto confirms we had balbhog manbhog purbi sail kart baki and maina tho each of these had different characteristics they needed less water and no fertilizer they dont need dap urea or pesticides but the new produce twice as much theresult khet kharab hoe gelo says sabitri labh ke liye purano dhan chhod diyo now the fields are spoilt for profit people left off planting the old strains bindiya devi is a second success story a matriarch of 80 plus bindiya became a widow after her first child she lives with her son and a large extended family daughter in law of bindiya devi saysthe real result of the shift to the new seeds is more work for the women 75 per cent of the transplanting is done by women over a 40 day period and 95 per cent of the weeding is done by66women post planting their work has increased due to weeding dhan nikauni unless you weed strenuously the improved varieties will choke there were few weeds in the old rice because its tall and blocks the light now the dap etc greatly strengthen the weeds the leaves are hard like knife blades they dont cut the skin like the new ones do the backaches with the long hours spentweeding and the fingers and palms of their hands get red they get sores and cut around their nails we simply cant grind turmeric and other sharp spices any more she says theres a great difference in taste too as well as in other characteristics there was one very productive hybrid variety which they soon rejected if you cooked it at 6 pm it would spoil by 11 pmso if the men came home late for dinner no one would get to eat until a second meal was cooked bindiyas family still plants 50 per cent of the land with the old seed its less risky she says needs less water when cooked it doesnt spoil for two days but they still seem to spend a lot more on health in spite of severe arthritis bindiya still does some of the work of sorting and storing seedsshe has a mora a 3foot high coil of rice straw plastered inside with cow dung and clay to hold paddy in and the bamboo dimni in which they store seeds there used to be a practice of exchanging seeds within the village earlier she says now the men take the surplus and give it to the block in exchangefor new seeds the kurmi women contribute a major part of the labour as in any rice growing culture but we sense a change in their role and status here its the men who go to the block and interact with the extension people the men sell the grain surplus and leftover seeds the women dont read the booksgiven by the block and the agrishops and cant quite figure out the new methods for themselves somewhere theyve lost out it the new agriculture that is being pushed by the seed companies through the willing agency of the block officials jagdishpur the kurmi mahato women of jagdishpur have discovered a new vocation which helps them to offset the decreased earnings from agriculture earlier they would gather fresh picked garden green and other local vegetables and carry them all the way to town for sale in the daily market now jamuna devi and many other women trek the 15 km to hazaribagh town each morning to buyvegetables and market them in baskets from house to house to the women of the middle class localities and government colonies jamuna out her wares with a basket on her head looks like a typical village woman come to them straight from her own kitchen garden jamuna and her friends leave home at 6 am and return after dark with money twisted into their saris at the waist jamuna earns a profit of rs1500 a month selling vegetables this way cash in had gives these women a sense of status and a say in the home as an acknowledged breadwinner all their earlier work in the rice fields and vegetable gardens went unrecognized a new venture had given themeconomic independence a newfound business sense but it also means a continuing neglect of the productive assets they already own in the form of their cultivated lands and herds of domestic animals67karra blocks headquarters are situated about 40 km from jharkhands state capital ranchi the karra society for rural action has initiated a microfinance programme for women farmers and entrepreneurs in the block there are at present 255 groups with a membership of about 4250members the ngo promotes sustainable development organic agriculture craft and other income generating activities and environmental restoration the karra society helps farmers to innovate by distributing a yariety of seeds for trials on test plots crops that do well are then selected for cultivation the following year in this the society support from the bihar beej nigam bihar seed corporation the block agriculture office and the birsaagriculatural university bau who are all activity promoting new crops farmers seeds of the previous year may be exchanged for new seeds of the type being promoted by these organizations as well as a number of other private players in the field a groundnut variety with the trendy name ak 1224 andvarious lentils are distributed at low cost by the block soyabean for some reason is distributed free at cost to farmers for planting society members say that farm families rely on their own seeds for marua finger millet and traditional rice strains like bhajana sursuia mis samanpuia and tulsi nanjan however they are increasingly experimenting with hybrid seeds that the local shops stock sita devi and her husbandram prasad mahto have two acres of wetland paddy and several plots for vegetables they grow cauliflower tomatoes ginger groundnut corn and potatoes they mange to preserve and plant their own seeds for chilies radishes summer squashes and beans mustard and spinach the story of martha bakhla chairperson of mahila mandal is different tribal farmers are hesitant about adopting new practices and technologies because they dont have the capital with which to buyexpensive inputs and they dont want to take loans banks the lamps and other government sources you can get fertilizers on installment now chemical fertilizers give you greater production at first later you dont get the same results martha says for one or two years even women would go out and take loans for agriculture then interest rates went up people couldnt pay back the loans some farmers were jailed there is a system herecalled kurkijabti by which the bank and moneylenders can confiscate animals of loan defaulters people saw this happen and got scared an organization called world vision has adopted some villages nearby and one of the things they are promoting is soybeans which they distribute at rs15 perkilogram no one has tested the seed to check its provenance there is a type of contract farming being promoted in karra the agency be it the block office or the ngo give the seeds and also help market the produce new seeds are sometimes distributed free for testing on farmers fields martha says tribal farmers are more conservative in their choice of cropping pattern here they plant several traditional varieties of rice in their don khet wetland paddy fields bhojana rais dahiyahat higunja lal dhan in the uplands they wait for the rains in sawan and plant godha dhan upland rice and a mix of sarguja and sesame as oilseeds there is less investment better taste and were independent we can sell out produce within the village or in the local hoot weekly village market68with loans from the microcredit scheme run by the karra society the malgo womens group has decided to go commercial this monsoon they will plant marigolds and ginger the first will be picked up by flower buyers who come daily to karra for their suppliers the second is selling at rs 80 per kilogram in the bazaar in ranchi up 300 per cent since last year due to a shortage being feltin the whole of north india this season microfinance through their own savings has helped these women to diversify and experiment with new crops unlike the men folk in their village biopiracy of wheat by monsanto wheat forms an integral part of the life of most indians it has been the principle crops in several regions of india for thousands of years india is the second largest producer of wheat 735million tones after china it is cultivated in 2568 million hectors in india apart from being the staple food of most indians wheat in india has been closely associated with religious ceremonies and festivals since time immemorial each traditional variety has its own religious or cultural significance the different varieties of wheat the use of different wheat preparationsin rituals and the medicinal and therapeutic properties of wheat have all been documented in ancient indian text and scriptures shiva and ritu 2003 monsantos patent ep 0445929 b1 claims to have invented wheat plants derived from a traditional indian variety and products made from the soft milling traits that the traditional indianwheat provides monsanto repeats the biopiracy pattern that was earlier attempted by ricetecs claim to have invented indian basmati through a case filed by the rfste in the indian supreme court which forced the government of india to challenge the ricetec patent no 5663484 in the uspto and a nationaland global movement against basmati biopiracy we succeeded in having 99 of the ricetec patent revoked earlier we had started the neem campaign to challenge the usdagrace patent which was revoked in epo in may 2000 with greenpeace we are preparing a challenge against monsantosbiopiracy of indian wheat and with farmers groups in india navdanya a programme under rfste is working to conserve rejuvenate and grow native wheat varieties which were displaced and marginalized by the green revolution even though in terms of nutrition per acre and productivity with respect towater they are superior to the industrial varieties which depend on intensive inputs of chemicals and water in reply to a parliamentary question on the monsanto wheat biopiracy the minister of agriculture has replied starred question no 8 dated 21st july 2003 ms plant breeding international aunilever company which was acquired by monsanto in 1998 has obtained a patent for a new verity of wheat designed for use in europe this variety incorporates some characteristics of the nap hal land race of wheat from india the nap hal land race is not covered by the european patent andcontinues to be available to indian farmers and researchers69the reply indicates that the government of india is not planning to take any action against the biopiracy and is in fact legitimising it the reply also accepts two flaws in the patent claim firstlyeuropean law does not allow patenting of plant varieties secondly the reply accepts nap hal asa name of a land race in india even though no farmer in india would name a traditional varietynaphal naphal means no fruits no farmers variety could have such a name the plants claimed as inventions in monsantos patent are essentially derived verities of traditional indian wheat referred to in the patent as nap hal available as accession no 1362 from the aercinstitute of plant science research norwich uk there is no traditional indian wheat called nap halin hindi the word would mean that which gives no fruit nap hal is not an indian name for anindigenous wheat variety it could have been a name for monsantos terminator seeds the vernacularnames of wheat varieties are khani mundia rotta sita kathia jandi and many others governmentalso says that the naphal was collected from marcha uttar pradesh by a united states departmentof agriculture usda explorer in 1948 and was received back by us from usda 1n 1992 andconserved in the directorate of wheat research karnal and nbpgr it is wrong to say that usdaexplorer in 1948 explored the nap hal var1ety and or 1n any manner contributed to the traditionalbiowealth in 1948 the alleged explorer did not make the collection h1mself but was handed overthese varieties even the locat10ns specified by the usda explorer are

of the bhotias who are tibetans speaking buddhist living in the upper reg10ns of the himalayas the discrepancy 1n the location and the name in case the variety referred to as nap hal was pirated and was not collected by the alleged explorer it is the governmentsduty to investigate which variety has been incorrectly recorded as nap hal and correct the nomenclature appropriately wheat is the most documented crop in india since formal breeding of wheat started more than a century ago in 1905 np 4pusa 4niphad 4 is beardless variety with felted white glumes with grains of an amber colour sir albert howard known as the founder of modern organic farming the author of the agriculture testament 1n whose honour rftsenavdanya organ1se the annual howard memor1al lecture on non violent agriculture on gandhi jayanti the 2nd october his wife glc howard andhabibur rehman khan selected the pure lines np4 pusa4 from the mundia land race in 1905 mundia combined higher yield potential early maturity with superior grain quality features as a icar report states it soon crossed the national boundaries and was adopted in many countries thevariety won prices in several international grain exhibitions as one of the best grain quality wheat during 19161920 this is how it must have entered the uk collections and got recorded under the distorted name nap hal indian wheats have travelled widely since 1873 with the opening of thesuez canal and removing export restrictions indian wheat was so important a crop for the british empire that an important resolution of the government of india no i 3950 of march 14th 1877 was passed on the wheat question requiring the governor general to provide all information on indianwheat including local names for the varieties of wheat cultivated and three description in english more than 1000 wheat samples in bags 02 pounds each were sent to the india office examined by forbes watson and a detailed report provided to the secretary of state it is the traits not the namethat will be the basis of our challenge of biopiracy and we are working on the analysis of the traits of various varieties conserved by navdanya farmers and grown by traditional farmers the soft milling low elasticity traits of india wheat have been patented the wheat plant claimed as invention in monsantos patent relates to products derived presumably from the primitive land racefrom india called naphal naphal are extremely unusual in lacking two high molecular weight hmw subunits of glutenin coded by the x and y genes which refer as the glu d1 double null trait the hmw subunits of glutenin which make up only about 610 of the gluten wheat proteincontent of wheat are the key components in conferring elasticity and dough mixing stability due to the lack of hmw glutenin in naphal the dough becomes more easily hydrable than other wheat and produces very weak inelastic dough which is very extensible this is advantageous in making of semisweet biscuits nonfermented crackers wafers and food and food ingredients made from batter because the flour will form dough with less water when sodium metabisulphite or sms is not used71the production of a strain of wheat variety galahad7 claimed by monsanto comprised of crossing a commonly grown soft wheat variety galahad with a sicco line containing the naphal glud1 double null wheat strain naphal x sicco the wheat provides flour from which dough can be prepared at ambient temperature without the need for chemical treatment sms of the flour atambient temperature and is useful in the manufacture of biscuits crackers and wafers and other the galahad7 is essentially derived from native indian wheat crossing is an obvious step in breeding and since both the criteria of novelty and nonobviousness necessary for patentability are violated thepatent should be revoked even though plants are not an invention the first statement in monsantos patent states this invention relates to plants and to products derived there from in this case the plant is essentially derived from the traditional indian wheats which indian farmers have collectively evolved and conservedover millennia the monsanto patent in effect pirates the collective cumulative innovation of indian farmers and people claims the piracy as an invention the traits of indian wheat which is being claimed by monsanto as its invention are traits evolved for indias food culture and cuisine based onrotis and chapattis the patent is thus a piracy not just of millennia of breeding by indian farmers but also of millennia of innovation in food qualities gluten wheat protein plays an important role in the texture of chapattis and other food preparations made form wheat the gluten content of wheat varies from about 913 the hardmilling varieties contain more gluten than the soft milling one which are more suitable for chapattis soft milling wheat is not an invention it is our daily diet for thousands of years we have eaten soft milling wheat appropriate to our food culture ignoring the daily diet of one fifth of humanity monsanto arrogantly claims no wheat varieties are yet available commercially which are soft milling and from which a dough with low or very low elasticity can be prepared with out either chemical treatment or the use of carefully controlled conditions eglow temperature during the preparation of the dough the need to maintain critical conditions during dough preparation is obviously a serious constraint on manufacture the need for chemical free treatment of the flour usually conducted with sodium metabisulphate sms would be avoided ifpossible especially in view of the current consumer pressure for foodstuffs those have been chemically treated it is generally recognized that the biscuit making industry would avoid the use of sms if there was any commercially viable alternative the alternative is available on a very wide scale in india in our daily food this is the alternative which monsanto has pirated monsantos claim covers wheat plants derived from indian wheat varieties and products made from soft milling wheat the patent needs to be revoked because it is not an invention it also needs to be revoked because with an exclusive right to grow wheat with low gluten and produce high value products withit monsanto could extend these rights to india under the patent cooperation treaty pct and then72charge royalties from farmers growing traditional wheat varieties even if the patent is not recognized in india monsantos biopiracy patent in europe and usa prevents india from deriving benefits from the growing market in us and europe for hemical feel low gluten wheat products native indian wheats years of research on indian wheat by sir albert howard his wife glc howard and habibur rehman khan has resulted in diverse range of wheat varieties they made a comprehensive collection of the wheat sorts enormous variability present in the land races they identified 37 separate botanicalvarieties of wheat belong to 10 subspecies sir albert howard contribution towards indian wheat sir albert howard was the founder of the organic farming movement he worked for 25 years as an agricultural investigator in india first as agricultural adviser to states in central india and rajputana then as director of the institute of plant industry at indore where he developed the famed indore composting process which put the ancient art of composting on a firm scientific basis butmost of his work in india was on improving crop varieties mainly of wheat he and his wife g loc howard formed a brilliant scientific team during a long career in india they achieved good results with the wheat howards were the first to undertake in india wheat breeding work on a systematicbasis in 1906 they commenced both at pusa bihar and lyallpur in the punjab now in pakistan a system of selection from single plants which enabled them to produce several wheats of much greater value than the mixtures then in cultivation the howards were able to develop within a short timeseveral varieties outstanding in yield and quality by selection from local types prior to the imitation of wheat improvement work in india various mixed types of wheat were being grown in different areas the types being designated by local names often hard and soft kerneled types or red and whitekerneledsorts would become mixed with the result that price of indian wheat in the export market was very low from these various types the howard isolated many pure line of which two became widely grown varieties pusa 4 and pusa 12 now called np 4 and np 12 pusa 4 has plump hard grains and thepusa 12 is a soft wheat with white grains these are outstanding examples of the results achieved at pusa through individual plant selection pusa 4 np 4 a pure line selection from the local sorts mundia combined higher yield potential and early maturity with superior grain quality features itsoon crossed the national boundaries and was adopted in many other countries the variety won prizes in several international grain exhibitions as one of the best grain quality wheat during the years 1916 1920 work on similar pure lines were carried by the howards at the centers resulted in the productionof improved types such as type 9 type 90 type 11 and type 8a at lyallpur in the punjab pakistan c13 k13 at kanpur in uttar pradesh and ao13 and ao90 at nagpur inmadhya pradesh cargills nature fresh atta spells doom for chakki fresh milling cargill is the worlds largest grain trader and the largest privately owned company in the us both domestically in the us and internationally cargill uses its size its information and its tremendous73financial resources to influence the price of agricultural commodities cargill controls over 70 of the worlds trade in cereals cargill foods has been aggressively marketing its what flour in india and distributing free samples to establish its monopoly in the wheat trade and flour milling since cargill has entered the wheat trade in india half of the processing mills in punjab have been closed downcargills war on our food system if not stopped would have serious implications on our food systems and agricultural sector as bad as the kargil war infact cargill has used the kargil victory celebrations to launch the free distribution of nature fresh atta thus exploiting the sentiments of the public andcreating confusion in the minds of consumers cargill says that it is delivering increased value to producers this to cargill means contract farming where the farmers will be compelled buy seeds from cargill or cargillspecified seed companies use cargills phosphates and other fertilizers specified by cargill use pesticides specified by cargill have cargill inspectors grade the produce and finally sell to cargill at a predetermined price cargill would like to put a stop to the saving of seed by farmers of free exchange of seed between farmers in its propaganda it does this by declaring the scientific traditions of farmers as unscientific in its technology it achieves this trough hybrid seeds which force the farmer to return to cargill at every showing delivering increased value to consumers means that cargill manipulates prices to farmers and international prices as well as domestic prices of agricultural produce and their processed products controls storage by controlling giant silos and elevators that can hold the worlds grain reserves for more than a year controls transportation of the grain from the farm to the store by controlling shipping road and rail routes controls processing by controlling milling and extraction and other processing operation provides no access to information about the process and the product erosion of womens control on seed and biodiversity seeds are the first link in the food chain for five thousand years peasants have produced their own seeds selecting storing and replanting and letting nature take its course in the food chain the feminine principle has been conserved through the conservation of seeds by women in their work in food and grain storage with the preservation of genetic diversity and the self renewability of food74crops has been associated the control by women and third world peasants on germ plasm the source of all plant wealth all this changed with the green revolution at its heart lie new varieties of miracle seeds which have totally transformed the nature of food production and control over food systems the miracle seeds for which borlaug got a nobel prize and which rapidly spread across the third world also sowed the seeds of a new commercialization ofagriculture borlaug ushered in an ear of corporate control on food production by creating a technology by which multinationals acquired control over seeds and hence over the entire food system the green revolution commercialized and privatized seeds removing control of plant genetic resources from thirdworld peasant women and giving it over to western male technocrats in cimmyt irri and multinational seed corporations women have acted as custodians of the common genetic heritage through the shortage and preservation of grain in a study of rural women of nepal it was found that seed selection is primarilya female responsibility in 604 percent of the cases women alone decided what type of seed to use while men decided in only 207 percent as to who actually performs the task of seed selection in cases where the family decides to use their own seeds this work is done by women alone in 812 percentof the households by both sexes in eight percent and by men alone in only 108 percent of the households throughout india even in years of scarcity grain for seed was conserved in every household so that the cycle of food production was not interrupted by loss of seed the peasant women of indiahave carefully maintained the genetic base of food production over thousands of years this common wealth which had evolved over millennia was defined as primitive cultivars by the masculinist view of seeds which saw its own new products as advanced varieties the green revolution was a strategy of breeding out the feminine principle by the destruction of the selfreproducing character and genetic diversity of seeds the death of the feminine principle in plant breeding was the beginning of seeds becoming a source of profits and control the hybrid miracle seeds are a commercial miracle because farmers have to buy new supplies of them everyyear they do not reproduce themselves gains from hybrids do not produce seeds that duplicate the same result because hybrids do not pass on their vigour to the next generation with hybridization seeds could not more be viewed as a source of plant life producing sustenance through food andnutrition they were now a source of private profit only shiva 1992 green revolution varieties of seeds were clearly not the best alternative for increasing food production from the point of view of nature women and poor peasants they were useful for corporations that wanted to find new avenues in seeds and fertilizer sales by displacing women peasants ascustodians of seeds and builders of soil fertility and they were useful for rich farmers wanting to make profits the international agencies which financed research on the new seeds also provided the money for their distribution the impossible task of selling a new variety to millions of small peasants75who could not afford to buy the seeds was solved by the world bank undp fao and a host of bilateral aid programmes which began to accord high priority to the distribution of hyv seed in their aid programmes over the past decade through new property rights and new technologies corporations have hijacked the diversity of life on earth and peoples indigenous innovation intellectual property rightsipr regimes globalized through the trips agreement of wto and have been expanded to cover life forms thus creating monopoly control over biodiversity patents on life are a hijack of biodiversity and indigenous knowledge they are instruments of monopoly control lover life itself patents on loving resources and indigenous knowledge as an enclosureof the biological and intellectual commons the biodiversity act 2002 which should have been aimed at defending community rights has instead facilitated the privatization of biodiversity and indigenous knowledge this is why the success of movements in forcing syngenta to back off from piracy of our rice collections is significant as one of the oldest and larges agricultural societies india also has an impressive diversity of at least 166 species of crop plants and 320 species of wild relatives of cultivated crops forests which contain much though by no means all of indias biodiversity now comprises about 64 million hectares or about 19 of land area of india according to satellite imagery roughly 33 probably representsprimary forest about 10 million hectares are managed as protection forests for ecological stability 15 million for production of timber and 25 million as social forest to meet the demand for the fuel wood and fodder about 14 million hectares lie within national parks and wildlife sanctuaries of the estimated 45000 plant species about 15000 species of flowering plants 6 of the worldwide total an estimated 33 are endemic to india areas rich in endemism are northeast the western ghats and the north western and eastern himalayas however the andaman and nicobar island contribute at least 200 endemic species to the endemic flora estimates of other plant taxoninclude 5000 species of algae 1600 lichens 20000 fungi 2700 bryophytes and 600 pteridophytes and of the estimated 81000 fauna species includes 50000 insects 4000 molluses 200 fish 140 amphibians 420 reptiles 1200 birds and other invertebrates indias bird species represent about 13 of the worlds total mammal fauna comprises 372 species with 63 found in assam thus indiais home to about two lakh species of living organisms most of the people in our country derive their livelihood and meet their survival needs from the diversity of living resources the indigenous knowledge system in medicine agriculture and fisheries are the primary base for meeting the food and health needs of the majority of our people in thiscontext therefore conservation of biodiversity is intimately linked to indigenous knowledge system on the one hand and peoples rights to protect their knowledge and resources on the other hand whenever biodiversity is threatened and eroded peoples rights and peoples knowledge is also eroded76seventy percent of india depends upon traditional systems of production for their survival the majority of the people in the rural areas involved in agriculture are small marginal farmers and peasants seeds produced and sold by farmer account for over 70 per cent of the total seed supply in the country similarly more than 70 percent of indias health care needs are met by traditionalsystems of medicines whose practitioners use over 7500 varieties of medicinal plants as part of their healing work in fact the biodiversity based traditional healthcare system is being kept alive by 360740 ayurvedic practitioners 29701 unani experts and 11644 specialists of siddha according to an ethnobotanical survey in late nineties in addition millions of housewives birth attendants and herbal healers carryon village based health traditions the sharing and exchange of biological resources and knowledge of its properties and use has been the norm in all indigenous societies and it continues to be the norm in most communitiesincluding the modem community but sharing and exchange get converted to piracy when individuals organizations or corporations who receive biodiversity and knowledge from indigenous communities freely and converts this gifts into private property

monsanto bagged the trophy at the lakshya event at the national institute of industrial engineering mumbai for a rural marketing project the project by monsanto was a market development strategy aimed at capturing the smallto marginal farmer segment it was deployed at the udaipur district in rajasthan that forms the single largest maize growing district in the country the objective of the project was to provide a solutions package to small farmers on improved technologies particularly focusing on maize crops farmerswere encouraged to train other farmers back home through a special humsafar programme monsantos much lauded project humsafar actually involves the introduction of its econarcotic roundup the controversial glysophate based herbicide to small and marginal peasants in udaipur and turning an important local food and fodder crops into raw material for industry through the aegisof a nongovernmental organization karmasheel sansthan the corporation used the devastating drought of 2002 as its entrypoint drought is invariably the harbinger of food and fodder shortage creating famine conditions of both humans and cattle in 2002 the droughtinduced famine had killed over 30 people in rajasthanincluding 12 children monsantos maize varieties that are being promoted for industrial food are also not giving the high yields promised and have in many places failed to perform adequately maize is the most important food crop grown in rajasthan growing along with millet in areas where few other crops grow again rajasthan itself is the most important maize growing region in thecountry the total area under maize cultivation in the country in 2001 was 655 lac hectares of which 96 lac hectares was in rajasthan with 172 lac hectares in udaipur the highest maize growing district in the country where maize is sown over 75 cultivable land during kharif the majority of the maizegrown in rajasthan is rainfed maize maize is also an important industrial crop as it produces a high field of starchenergy per hectare in addition like other cereal crops it cultivation has often been diverted from being a food crop to a producer of starch cellulose and as raw material for industrial production of glucosesorbital dextrose high fructose syrup maltodoxrine germ oil germ meal fiber and other products which have applications in industries as diverse as alcohol textiles paper pharmaceuticals organic chemicals cosmetics edible oil poultry live stock and fish feed the cattle and poultry feed industry in particular consume enormous amounts of maize which makes up almost 812 percent of the feed79monsantos maize will not increase food security monsantos claim of helping farmers of the udaipur region of rajasthan improves their living standards and thus their food security through the cultivation of their maize variety is false for the following reasons i monsanto varieties need extra water and thus create water shortage and contribute to drought in fact in large areas where sown the varieties have failed because rajasthan is facing severedrought conditions i the yields promised by monsanto have not been met in farmers fields in fact monsanto itself appears to be rather unsure about the productivity of its varieties as it has highly varying claims in its various publicity material iii the production costs to farmers growing monsantos maize varieties are much higher than the costs to farmers growing local rainfed varieties as the former varieties need chemical inputs while the latter produce grain with onfarm inputs iv monsanto is promoting the cultivation of its maize varieties as an industrial crop rather than as food crop today there is just one purchaser for these varieties this purchaser godrej agrovatpays higher rates for monsantos maize than the market rate the company is not bound either to continue to buy from farmer or give the same rare even at this high rate the net returns to the farmer are lower than those growing local varieties as the production costs are muchhigher three different claims by monsanto for productivity of their maize varieties field staff at wana and menar villages in udaipur reported that the monsanto varieties have achieved maize productivity of 12 quintalsacre 30 quintalhec monsanto won the laskhya general and hr management award for its programme humsafar by claiming that the yields of the farmershas increased to 20 quintals per acre 50 quintals per hectare whereas monsanto through its publicity brochures distributed among the farmers is claiming even much higher yields

popularization of maize cultivation after four months 14 more villageswere included now programme has been extended to 98 villages in udaipur chittorgarh and banswara districts the humsafar programme has been initiated with the ngo karamsheel sansthan and the rajasthan college of agriculture udaipur now known as maharana pratap agriculture and technicaluniversity the programme operates from seven humsafar kendras with seven persons overseeing the programme at the field level staff posted at the kendras conduct the field studies with the help of village sarpanch and other functionaries to find out where the farmers are involved in growing desiindigenous maize the staff also assesses the willingness of the farmers to grow the monsanto varieties of maize bt cotton although cotton acreage forms only five percent of indias total cropped area over half the chemical pesticides on agriculture amounting to about rs 1600 crores a year is consumed by thiscrop controlling bollworm infestation in cotton with pesticide costs indian farmers rs 1100 annually with pesticide resistance increasing and becoming wide spread chemical sprays do not always succeed in protecting the crop the icar calculated that by using integrated pest management methods withone or two sprays the bt cotton hybrids could save rs 1500 per hectare on chemical pesticides and provide additional return through higher yield of rs 7000 to rs 8000 per hectare it therefore seems81hit1ly probable that bt cotton will enthusiastically taken up by indian farmer the area under this transgenic crop is likely to grow rapidly if the benefits from bt cotton are immediate the risk could take some years to manifest themselves a severe pest infestation is presently driving farmers to spray huge doses of pesticides in an attempt to save their crop yet virtually all farmers report that the pest simply cannot be controlledthis is hardly surprising considering the 600 fold resistance developed by bollworm to pesticides over the last 10 years according to cotton scientists the costs of cultivation of cotton have increased so dramatically that in some villages the debt accumulated over the last two to three years has risen tors 50000 per house hold it is no longer rare for women to mortgage their mangalsutra or land owning farmers to sell an acre or two to start repaying their debt the entire support

former while maximizing the latter sugarcane crashing prices cause concern sugarcane cultivation and processing is an important source of agriculture income and employment sugarcane is the largest processing industry next only to cotton textiles an instrisinic symbolic relationship exists with rural masses and it is a nerve center for rural development and employment there are 414sugar mills in india which has emerged as the main producer of sugarcane at 300 million tonnes from 4 million hectares at present country is producing over 18 million tonnes of sugar in addition sugarcane supports a large number of open pan sugar khandsari and jaggery gur units in theunorganized sector with a production of over 10 million tonnes of jaggery the average smp payable by the factories during last two years season works out to rs 7514 per quintal in west up and rs 7134 per quintal in east up this is the way below the prices of rs 100 per quintal on early ripening cane and rs 95 on common varieties which the farmers were gettingin the recent years in other words the industry is effectively seeking a rs 25 reduction in the cane price supplied by the farmers the lower price is however not acceptable to the farmers according to farmers for every quintal 100 kg of cane crushed the mills obtain not only 10 kg of sugar but also six kgs of molasses andfour kgs of baggasse and press mud even if the average exfactory price of sugar has dipped to rs 12 per kg if one computes revenue from other streams taking average rate of rs 100 per quintal each for molasses and baggase and rs 10 per quintal for press mud mills realize over rs 130 onevery quintal of cane they purchase at rs 100 even after accounting for conversion and processing cost the mills would be left with a fair margin

of production and fall in income to the farmers affecting the survival of women less nutritive crops and resources of food entitlements food security in agriculture is based on a delicate balance between market forces and public policy and the rights of consumers as well as producers this balance would ensure that food pricesare not too high to take food beyond the reach of already deprived consumers and not too low so as to push out domestic farmers from production food is not merely an item of consumption food production is also the most significant source of livelihood for most indian people it is through theirparticipation in food production that most people in india are entitled to food while lower food prices might be good for societies with hardly any farmers they are devastating for food security in peasant economies where livelihood depends on the sales of produce in domestic markets shiva 1999 therefore the impact of trade liberalization on food security is different in different socio economic contexts for those items where domestic prices are lower than international prices trade liberalization leads to exports and thus a rise in domestic prices whereas for those items where86domestic prices are higher than international prices trade liberalization leads to dumping and a displacement of domestic producers from agriculture in such a situation cheap food can be a prescription for famine when it displaces domestic producers and destroys their entitlement shiva 1999 a comparison of nutrition needs of a person assessed according to activity

declining food production agricultural policies that push the small farmer to destitution on the one hand and promote cash cropping on the other have resulted in lowered food production there has been a steady decline in food production since the early 90s as a result of the thrust towards exportoriented agriculturethe collapse of domestic support for food production through dismantling the msp rising costs of inputs crop failure due to uncertified seeds in the late90s has intensified this shift as farmers are desperate to recover their losses the country is already facing a decline in food production to theorder of 128 in just one year the national nutrition monitoring bureau 1997 data shows a declining trend in consumption in rural india particularly in cereal and millets the main source of energy for the poor from 1990 to 1995 the most important reasons for this decline are87 rising food prices destriction of livelihoods destruction of the pds system shift to export oriented agriculture t rade liberalization links to a decline in food consumption are even more evident in the sub saharan region of africa trade liberalization links to a decline in food consumption are even more evident in the subsaharan region of africa as a result of loan conditional adjustment and export thrust five of the six most populous countries of this region which together comprise 60 of the totalpopulation of the region have experienced a decline in calorie intake per head even after taking account of net food aid inflows in india the per capita grain availability has been seriously declining since 1995 when wtos rules started being implemented in fact national sample survey nss rounds starting from the 38thround have documented the decline in cereal consumption 1992 following the implementation of saps the reduced consumption on the one hand and the decline in agricultural production and procurement on the other are directly linked though the food and agricultural policies of the governmentcolonialism had destroyed the food sovereignty of the country forcing changes in cropping from food for local and regional food security to commercial crops rice particularly had become a commercial crop even within the country starvation it was orissas kalahandi district in 2001 then jharkhands palamau district in the beginning of 2002 followed by madhya pradeshs shivpuri district and then rajasthans baran district where deaths due to starvation have been reported in all the cases it has been either the media or citizens groups which have brought these deaths to public notice unfortunately the pattern has been for thestate governments to deny that the deaths have been due to starvation the government of orissa claimed that people had died because they consumed mango kernels the government of jharkhand said that the deaths were due to sickness and old age and the government of rajasthan has carriedits defense to the extreme by stating that people had died because they had eaten a variety of grass which was part of the traditional diet the fact is that none of these deaths would have occurred if the people of the area had access to food as they should have under the antyodaya anna yojana aay which is supported to providerice and wheat at highly subsidized prices to poorest of the poor in baran district the identification of the beneficiaries of the aay could not be completed and the ration shops in many villages did not stock cereals for sale as part of the welfare schemes the irony is that in many parts of the countrythe aay has literally known a lifeline to the citizens at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder88the report prepared by some ngos says that food for work programmer and the public distribution system is dysfunctional in rajasthan the issue is not limited to deaths but the means of survival in the villages of mamoni gangapur sheharana rajpura betha lalkankri bhawanagarh karwarikalan and hatiydeh in baran distrct only a lucky few got two chapatis to eat every two dayswhile the rest did not have more than half kg flour which they boiled to make lapsi and ate with one vatki of boiled water people in these villages were consuming sarna wild grass seeds as they hardly had any food grains with them and now even grass has dried up people were also boiling phang a wild greenvegetable and eating its leaves as they have nothing else to consume others were seen meat of dead sheep on account of which many fell ill when even grass dried up the able bodied villagers started to dig roots of a herb shalavri after being peeled and dried these herbs were sold at rs5 to 6 a kilogram a few people were also boilingand drying amla and bartering it for wheat as result people were earning a meager rs56 every two or three days in india millions of men women and children are chronically undernourished pregnant women are worst affected since maternal and foetal under nutrition results in the birth of children with lowweight less than 25 kg such children are handicapped at birth in brain development the cruelest form of inequity amidst reports of hunger and starvation deaths india continues to make room for exporting surplus food grains that an estimated 320 million people desperately need food despite more than60 million tones stocked in the open there was a proposal to dump it in the sea to make storage space for the next crop when export market could not be found for this surplus persons consuming less than 1890 kcal unit per day may be considered as hungry as the consumption is very much lower than the food adequacy norms of icmr about 42 percent of the ruralpopulation consumes less than 2430 kcal unit per day the average calorie consumption for rural india is 2683 kcal unit per day the people with basic minimum calorie intake face longterm ill effects of malnourishment calorie deficiency in terms of both spread and depth may be due to higher foodprices lower incomes lack of

anemia unfortunately efforts at iron supplementation programme and nutrition programme for pregnant and lactating women have not reached the intended populations or prevalence of anemia among women gopalan and shiva 2000 national nutrition monitoring bureau nnmb surveys showthat even after 50 years of independence average intake of calories is substantially below the recommended dietary allowance rda for men and women majority of the people in india derive their calories from cereals like wheat rice maize the cheapest source of energy and not from other sources such as oils fats nuts oil seeds pulses and90milk which are consumed in minimal amounts because of highcosts per capita availability of pulses has decreased from 607 gms to 34 gms per day calories and energy are required by the body to maintain body temperature metabolic purposes support growth physical activity and work rda for energy is the average requirement and nothing more the intake and expenditure of energy are extremely finely balanced and any surplus energyconsumption is stored as fat and continuous intake results in increased weight inadequate weight gain reflects inadequate food intake a significant section of men and women continue to be atleast 5 to 8 kg less than the desirable weight mean intake of 2100 calories b y women suggests that 50 of the population is subsisting on deficit diet which is less than 2100 calories any decrease in calorie intake results in weight loss or decrease in the activity patterns to conserve energy chronic low level of energy intake and increase in the work demand obviously effects womens health and nutritional status negatively this level of calorie consumption was possible because of the cost of food grains influenced by the existence of public distribution system pds agricultural subsidies and subsidies on inputs like water power in determining the prices of the cheapest source of calorie ie cereals in view of the new economic policies prices and wages are expected to be determined by the changing marketconditions withdrawal of subsidies would make even the calories from the cereals less accessible to those without adequate purchasing power this could result in millions slipping into the category of malnourished it is significant to point out that 52 of children below the age of 5 years in india arealready malnourished gopalan shiva 2000 it is also assume that any availability of food is going to be distributed within the household according to need of the individual family members unfortunately the intrahousehold distribution of food continues to reflect the gender biases of society it is the women and the girl children who eatlast and least intake of protective foods like milk eggs meat fish fruits and vegetables are adequate only in high income group hig and middle income groups mig dietary intakes of rural women are worse than low income group lig population food intakes of all protective foods such as milkvegetables and pulses are deficient nutritional studies indicate that adequate calories and protective foods are assured only to certain income groups obviously in general nutritional status tends to be quite clearly linked within economic categories such as class land holdings wages and householdincomes however other criteria such as caste and ethnic tribal status also lend to be quite significant chandra shekhar and ghosh 2003 any major shift in agriculture in terms of cropping pattern control of seeds laws related to patenting of seeds liberalization of imports of food oil and grain and increased food processing isbound to affect the subsistence and marginal farmers the impact will be substantial as 70 of employment for the people in india is in the primary sector most people tend to overlook the fact that major part of the farming and agricultural work is done by women this is despite the absence of a91legal right to the land or the products they depend on their land for food as well as income for their families and earn wages by working on others lands to feed their families in india with 36 of the people living below the poverty and increasing food prices the low nutritional status for women who already eat last and least get further affected in a country with large food reserves the inability to purchase food due to inadequate purchasing power reflected in the poornutritional status sometimes resulting in starvation deaths as in kalahandi orissa bundelkhand up dhule maharashtra is a matter of great concern these areas happen to be tribal areas often drought prone with a high incidence of illiteracy and deep indebtedness and prone to exploitation thestrategic approach has to take these factors into consideration for dealing with such special areas of concern to relieve people of malnutrition and hunger debt and farmers suicide the burden of the agrarian crisis has obviously fallen on the small and marginal farmers the rising cost of cultivation coupled with the risk associated with it has not only added to the burden on the peasantry but made life uncertain for the poor peasants a tragedy of unprecedented proportionis unfolding in andhara pradesh according to the andhra pradesh ryothu sangam aprs 279 peasants have committed suicide between may 14 and june 14 2004 after the congress government assumed office however the government has put the figure at 194 sridhar 2004 unlike the rounds of suicides in 198788199798 and 2000 when peasants growing particular such as tobacco cotton chillies and ground nut ruined this time death stalks every where no crop appears safe and no section of the small peasantry appears insulated the overwhelming proportions of the death toll is among small and marginal farmers and tenant cultivators who have no claims onthe land they cultivate and who pay exorbitant rents to the landlords an increase in the suicide rate in a population is generally known to indicate acute stress that people undergo during a phase of social crisis death by suicide is among the most horrible consequence of the policies of the government what is even more shocking is that the government ignored therepeated cries of depress in the peasantry deep in debt following periodic losses suffered because of poor crops yields and low prices farmers sold their kidneys highest number of cases has been reported from rebitachintala mandal in the palamdu area sridhar 2004 for march and may are the months when farmers settle old loans and get new ones for kharif crop this is also the time when moneylenders start recovering their money with repeated crop failures and high costs of cultivation the farmers had no money to repay debts the elections also played a role money lenders were quiet during elections immediately after pressure began to pile up therewas talk of a moratorium on debt recovery moneylenders were in a hurry to get back loans for heavily indebted farmers the system cracked up forcing them to commit suicide joshi 20049265 farmers in the vidharbha region of maharashtra have killed in 2004 over debts as little as rs 8000 because when it does not rain and where proper irrigation facilities do not exist these small amounts crush hope and with it life thirty committed suicide in just june alone very often the family of the suicide victims do not have money to arrange for the last rites chaudhrui 2004 farmers had pawned their houses cattle some even the wifes mangalsutra to borrow money but it was finally vanishing that broke their spirit since 2001 about 340 farmers have committed suicide in the region of vidharbha kappikar 2004 it is becoming evident that nothing but a reversal of the agrarian and agriculture policies pursued in the past decade or so under the garb of liberalization will stem the curse of death whilepoliticians and bureaucrats waffle on what the peasant actually needs the issue of an unqualified moratorium on repayments of loans by small peasants whether from private or institutionalized source has became a life and death question this will determines whether the lives will be saved inthe days ahead an increase in the suicide rate in a population is generally known to indicate acute stress that people undergo during a phase of social churn death by suicide is among the most horrible consequences of the policies of the government what is even more shocking is that the government ignored therepeated cries of distress in the peasantry more pertinently the phenomenon of suicides among sections of the peasantry not only in andhra pradesh but also in karnataka punjab rajasthan maharashtra and kerala indicates that the indian peasantry is going through a deep churning it isalso obvious that this churning has been caused by the neoliberal prescription for agriculture the indian government celebrated its triumph in cancun but the negative impact of globalization on agriculture through the world trade organization regime has already compounded the agrarian crisis brought in by drought several agricultural commodities have seen a fall in the prices in the lastthree years owing to imports the lifting of agricultural and power subsidies have pushed up the cost of cultivation substantially and the withdrawal of safety nets like the universal public distribution system for food has increased expenditures for poor families the burden of irredeemable debt has eroded the living standards of those who are already poor throwing them to the mercy of moneylenders and depriving them of their dignity and standing in the rural society the noose is already around the neck of the farmer farmers suicides are no longer a feature of drought prone and economically backward districts the phenomena have spread to all regions including prosperous agriculture belts like mandya while49 suicides the highest figure recorded took place between april 1 and october 25 in drought prone hassan district during the same period 22 suicides took place in mandya the states sugar bowl and heartland of cauvery irrigation network eighteen suicides were committed in shimoga a paddy93growing district of high rainfall fourteen farmers ended their lives in heveri district which has normal rainfall the phenomenon of suicides amongst farmers in karnataka has been a recurrent theme in agricultural sector since 1998 the sudden and alarming spurt in suicides since april 2003 however appears to indicate a new trend and pattern farmers suicides are no longer a feature of droughtprone or the economically backward districts alone and nor are they occurring only in pockets of high investment agriculture like cotton growing tracts the pressure from moneylenders to repay loans appears to drive farmers particularly the small and marginal farmers to take their own lives loans from institutional lending sources typically accountfor just 10 per cent of a small farmers credit needs and there appears to be little evidence of banks forcing their creditors to repay their loans for example in heveri district the percentage recovery of loans to agriculture by banks was 49 per cent 44 per cent and 47 per cent respectively during thelast three years all banks have rephrased their loan and interest structures the disbursements of banks are going down as farmers are unable to repay loans because this is the third year of crop failure unable to get the loan from banks farmers have been forced to borrow from moneylenders at the exorbitant rate which usually vary from 24 to 60 per cent per annum sometimes even at higher rate though the coercion by the moneylenders rarely has taken the form of physical assault but the pressure always continue moneylenders come in the form of a group and harass the debtor thatresults in considerable loss of face and selfesteem for the latter after the suicide the family of the victim does not disclose the identity of the moneylender usually a large landlord as there are no generally written agreements between the moneylender and the victim that makes it difficult to punishthose who practise usury in mandya there has been a spate of suicides largely in maddur taluk though mandya is relatively an agrarian prosperity but due to the low storage capacity of dam in the cauvery basin farmers had to dig bore wells which unfortunately failed following are the few case studies of thefarmers suicide in mandya bangalore rural and hasan districts boraih aged 55 years of village gunnanayakandahalli in mandya district committed suicide on 6 september 2003 he has borrowed more than one lakh from friends and moneylenders besides a loan of rs 45000 from syndicate bank his elder son died four months back he received nocompensation from the government his last rites were conducted by the contribution of rs 6000 from friends villagers and relatives now the main breadwinner is the daughterinlaw similarly h k hanumme gowda of bidarhasahalli village committed

income and finds it hard to find any breadwinner his wife is seeking help for the education of the children94the case of puttaswamy of village bidarahalli in maddur taluk of mandya is not different having only three acres of land he has taken loan of rs 26000 from the cooperative society and rs 50000 from moneylenders no compensation was received and last rites were carried out with rs 25000 donated by abbas ali bohra a social worker from channapatna kadi gowda of huligerepure in mandya who was around 70 years old hanged himself due to reported failure of crops since last three years he has the loan of more than one lakh of which rs 80000 was from private parties he also collected the loan for the marriage of his daughter it is one of the few cases where the deceased is able to get

shows that growing indebtedness in the rural areas among the farmers is the main reason for the farmers to commit suicide in karnataka almost all the farmers who have committed suicide have taken the loan which costs more than their total land assets situation became worst when the government institutions stopped giving loan to thefarmers while there are varieties of reasons indebtedness is the common factor in all the suicides over 400 farmers in the states have committed suicide between april 1 and october 25 in 2003 by the end of november 2003 the number of suicides increased to 478 with

therebycausing unprecedented loss in natural productivity a report by indrajeet singh jeji a former mla and president of human rights organization says that almost 500 farmers have so far committed suicide in the state according to jeji lehra and andana blocks of punjab alone accounts for about 174suicidal deaths till june 2003 farmers having less than even one acre are burdened with the debt from rs one lakh to 11 lakhs some of them jumped in front of the railway tracks while others set themselves on fire but majority of them poisoned themselves one of the main reasons is the collapse of nuclear family in punjab which has affected the land holdings there is severe slump in the earnings of the farmers which is further adding to their debts now the farmers view agriculture as a loss making occupation and the realization is causing intense pressure among them96table 14 7 suicides by farmers in karnataka 1 april to 10 november 2003 sl district cases cases rejected for no reported

poll promise of providing bonus of rs 30 per quintal on crops in three instalments the payment of instalments was restricted to certain pockets of the state and that too at meager rate of rs 10 somewhere only rs 5 punjab is hailed as the launching pad of green revolution in india but pathetically the farmers of punjab are facing a debt burden of thousands of crores adverse residual effects of irrational application of synthetic fertilizers and plant protection agrochemicals have decreased the fertility status of the soil desperate use of these inputs not only falsified their hopes for better yield but alsocrippled them financially and the resultant frustration induced them to commit suicide increasing cost of production and decreasing productivity are proving most damaging the situation prevailing in eastern up bihar and orissa is no better it puts a big question mark on the entire concept of planning for agrorural development in the country agriculture which sustains the national economy is still the most neglected sector on the priority list of national development it is amazing how the central or the state government can afford to remain insensitive to the increasing cases of suicides committed by farmers it hurts ones sensibilitythat even a tragic situation like this is not enough to put our policy makers and planners to shame the genesis of the recent economic crisis in punjab lies in the distorted structure of its economy and disarticulated agrocultural social change the net barter terms of trade at 197071 100 between foodgrain and manufactured products was 9364 in 197172 and it deteriorated further to8548 in 199091 thereby this unequal market exchange also tends to weaken the socioeconomic position of the rural households dependant only or mainly on agriculture as cultivators and farm wage workers according to a study in punjab small and marginal farmers and landless labourers were more prone 0 suicide 452 per cent of the total suicides are by landless labourers 245 per cent are of small farmers and 188 per cent are by marginal farmers about 18 per cent report indebtedness as a cause of suicides a study by the agro economic research centre aerc of the punjab agricultural university pau on the indebtedness of farmers done for the ministry of agriculture threw up some shocking facts according to the study the small and marginal farmers are the largest number their holdings are small in the state and get merely 2702 per cent of the total agricultural credit here too theprocess is marred with wrong selection of beneficiaries improper monitoring and less promising purposes for which the loans are being advanced defeating the national objective of providing low cost credit to this groups there are 1706 banking institutions including 942 commercial banks in the rural areas of the state which have raised deposits worth rs 12254 crores and advanced about rs 6000 crores as loans to agriculture sector the share of certain thrust sectors like dairy and poultry besides fisheries98has decreased in the last three years and what to talk of diversification centre some time ago had directed the state to suggest measures so that a national policy could be drafted to benefit the marginal farmers whose conditions are deplorable even after half a century of independence the study recommended to the state government and centre to adopt the selfhelp group shgs strategyto provide low cost credit to the small and marginal farmers most of whom largely are dependent on the commission agents and moneylenders for their credit needs despite an increased flow of credit in the state crop loans still constitute more than twothirds of the agricultural advances incidentally there has been a decline in the proportion of advances made to crucial sectors like minor irrigation from 282 per cent to 109 per cent land development from047 per cent to 038 per cent farm machinery from 1683 per cent to 1167 per cent dairy farming from 537 per cent to 490 per cent and poultry from 158 per cent to 087 per cent it is interesting to note that commercial banks take nearly 15 days to process a loan against seven days by cooperative banks but the informal sectors ie moneylenders and commission agents process loan within half day similar situation is prevailing in west bengal unable to bear the soaring interests on bankloans over 80 farmers have ended their lives in the last three months in 2003 in west bengal most of themhail from the riceyielding districts of burdwan and bankura over 1000 have killed themselves in the past year paradoxically burdwan where most of the deaths have been reported is known as the rice bowl of the east the farmers are unable to meet the 16 per cent interest on loan charged by the public sector banks even the few microfinance institutions have failed to perform forcing the farmersinto a vicious debt trap what was acted as a double whammy for farmers is the poor price for their yields in the open market in the wake of a bumper harvest in the neighbouring states and cheap imports from south east asia and the late reaction of the state government in offering the minimum support price a sluggish jute market following the advent of an alldevouring plastic industry has prevented the jute corporationfrom uft1ng the stocks in time complicating the situation further however according to nirupam sen the state industries minister reports that the farmers are committing suicide due to bank loans are not fully true why should the farmers of burdwan commit suicide when they are far better off thanfarmers of many other districts the west bengal left front governments mucheulogized programme of land reform a key to its electoral success for more than two decades is regressing under the impact of liberalization small and marginal farmers who were the main beneficiaries of land reform are victims of the fallout no longer are they the instruments of social and economic change and productivity that they had beentill recently the gradual withdrawal of state subsidies for inputs such as fertilizer and seeds and the rising irrigation costs are making farming unaffordable for small and marginal farmers who form 76 per cent of the agricultural population and operate 60 per cent of the cultivable land99small and marginal farmers are forced either to sell or give land on lease to the rich class this is not only swelling the ranks of landless agricultural workers but has also begun negating the gains of land reforms according to a report in burdwan 60 per cent of 224051 patta holders owning about 80000 hectares of vested land under the governments land reforms programme have been forced tosell off their uneconomical holdings the buyers are mostly big landholders or the new rural rich who have been investing heavily in farming in fact there is growing penetration of the capitalist mode of production in the agriculture already several multinational companies engaged in food processing industries have been making bidsto buy vast tracks of good farmland in the state considering the present policy of the centre keeping these companies out of agriculture is just out of question on the contrary the process will get expedited in the coming years the rise in production costs has pitted the small and marginal farmersin an unequal race it is like asking a physically disabled person to run against carl lewis as long as the prices of input were heavily subsidized and controlled small farmers could somehow manage to eke out their livelihood from their land now their land is either getting sold or being taken on rentby rich landlords in burdwan a new class of rich farmers known as waterlords has also emerged following the scarcity of dvc water and falling levels of subsoil water in the district owing to electrically operated submersible pumps the waterlords earn large amount by selling high priced water to farmers thesmall and marginal farmers cannot afford this price these farmers whose holdings are adjacent to those of water lords are being forced to lease out their land to them b change in distribution system and dismantling of p ds off take of grain under public distribution system pds has been very low and has added to indias food insecurity during the april september period in 2002 the off take from ration shops for wheat was a dismal 1809 percent and only slightly better at 2575 percent for rice in september thewheat and rice off take was a mere 153 and 247 percent respectively the corresponding figures for families above the poverty line is dismal to say the least at 62 and 55 percent respectively indicating that states are hardly using p ds in case below poverty line bpl families the figures are slightlybetter at 455 and 503 percent respectively ironically bulks of stocks lifted from the central pool are for exports while there is a paradox of hunger within the country food insecurity and hunger is not restricted to any particular state and is an endemic national problem with many families not having money to even purchase wheat and rice at antyodya rates ofrs 2 and rs3 per kg respectively as a result they mortgage their ration cards for a pittance and are deprived of access to the p ds while the centre on its part is replenishing food stocks in vulnerable areas using rural transport service it is a systematic failure irrespective of who is in power in center or state and has to be addressed by taking corrective measures including not only disbursal of ration cards to the tribals but100also ensuring that they are neither mortgaged or used for making bogus entries while the poor do not get their due ration on oct 10 2002 sharad yadav the then minister of consumer affairs food and public distribution ruled out any impact of drought on the export of food grains from the country india has seen the worst drought in 2002 in many years and state after state were forced to admit thatthousands were dying of starvation millions of indians go to bed hungry as the government has dismantled the pds system and taken affordable food out of the reach of millions the wheat which the poor and the hungry are unable to purchase at rs 430 per kilo for those below the poverty line and at approx rs7 for those above it mostly those on the borderline ofpoverty is then exported through middlemen like cargill who are given this wheat at concessional prices often below the price at which the poorest have to buy the grain food grain export is liberalizations answer to the problem of over procurement from farmers even while it will bring in much needed foreign exchange however ever since indian agriculture wassubjected to liberalization both the share of agriculture exports in indias total exports as well as their value in hard cash has actually declined unlike the european countries where the public distribution system pds was discontinued after the second world war its importance has grown for an over populated and povertystricken countrysuch as india it was with the basic objective of curbing consumption and ensuring an equitable distribution of available food supplies especially in the deficit areas and among the poorer strata of society that the pds was introduced more than fifty years ago internationally food is being traded by powerful multinational companies by passing on the reins of the nations food security to these companies and the trading blocks through a policing system under the wto india is witnessing a gradual collapse of food selfsufficiency and the scrapping of the public distribution system the very foundations of food security what is being forgotten is that a developing economy such as indias needs a food security system that looks much beyond management of scarce supplies and critical situations food security systems are evolved as an integral part of a development strategy bringing about a striking technological change in food crops providing effective price and market support to farmers and deploying a widerange of measures to generate employment and income for the rural poor to improve their level of wellbeing including better physical and economic access to food grains food security therefore can only be ensured if the developing countries have provisions and powers to reenforce quantitative restrictions no amount of tinkering with suitable clauses on marketaccess domestic support and export subsidies is going to serve the food security needs of the developing countries as long as the subsidies both explicit and implicit are not brought down to zero in the developed world the developing countries should have the provision to continue with the quantitative101restrictions after all border protection is the only way for the developing countries to avoid being inundated by cheap and highly subsidized food and agricultural commodity imports food grain exports redirecting subsidies from farmers to traders the push towards exports is neither aimed at helping farmers of the nations finances rather in accordance with the impetus of wtos agreement on agriculture it is a way of diverting support away from farmers towards traders while the government dismantles procurement and public food distribution because they are considered subsidies to the people of the county and are supposed todistort trade it allows traders to buy bulk grains from its godowns at prices even lower than those offered to the poorest of the poor the difference is borne out of public money the annual budgets since liberalization having been adding to the subsidies for the corporate sector tax holidays for building silos and cold storages incentives for exporting subsidized transportationto the ports of the traders choice the recently announced 5 year export policy of the government has allocated rs 100 crores towards aided corporations transport grain from fci to the ports in addition public money is used to take land away from farmers to build transportation facilities foragribusiness to help them transport the grain even faster the experience of the 2001 wheat export exposes the governments lack of commitment to its people as against an economic cost of rs8300 per tonne to the fci and an open market price of rs 7000 per tonne india was offered a price of rs4300 per tonne in international market in may2001 the 20 000 tonne philippines order bagged by cargil was met through wheat sold to the multinational at the bpl rate however the existing attractive rates were further reduced with subsidies to the corporation whose financial capital is greater than that of many less developed countries over and above sellingthe wheat at the bpl rates the government agreed to bear the freight charge from rajpura to jamnagar port in gujarat and pay a commission to cargill thus wheat whose cost to the government included the msp rs580 of 2000 as well as the commission market charges levies and cess paidby fci increasing the real cost by another rs70 a quintal was sold at less than rs420 a quintal giving the corporation a subsidy of rs130 a quintal in fact since 2000 cargil has emerged as the biggest buyer of subsidized wheat being pushed by india into world markets cargill picked up 75 lac tones of indian wheat between december 2000and january 2002 removal of quantitative restrictions qrs on 1st april 2001 india completely removed the quantitative restrictions qrs on imports from all 1429 items as per the bilateral agreement with the united states quantitative restrictions on imports in respect of 714 items have already been removed with effect from 1st april 2000 this formed part of the export and import ex 1m policy announced in new delhi on 31st march 2000102the qrs from the rest of 715 items actually 751 in the notification 2 of 31st march 2001 has been removed on 1st april this year qrs were being maintained ever since 1947 on balance of payments bop grounds under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt to which india was a signatory india participated in the 7year long uruguay round negotiations 19861993 which culminated in the signing of theuruguay round agreement in april 1994 and became a founder member of the world trade organization wto which came into being in january 1995 india subscribes to all the wto agreements but continued to maintain qrs on bop grounds as per the provisions of article xviiib of gatt till 31stmarch 2000 the quantitative restrictions wee maintained on balance of payment ground on 1429 items out of which 700 items were under restricted list 685 items were under sil special lmport license list and there were 44 items under canalized list in april 1999 about 1285 items were already shiftedto the open general license ogl list imports have been restricted by countries on various grounds for environmental and ethical reasons and reasons of public order for the third world in particular the issue of balance of payments and scarcity of foreign exchange has been a major reason for restricting imports such restrictions arepermitted under article xi of gatt which allows such restrictions as quantitative restrictions according to the commitment given by india to the developed world we had time till 2003 to remove all quantitative restrictions this commitment had been accepted by countries like european communities japan canada australia new zealand and switzerland yet india entered into a bilateralagreement with us on 28th december 1999 which hastened the removal and set a definitive timetable with full knowledge of how severe the impact of the removal of restrictions on imports would be the government of india asked washington to announce this socalled agreement only after indian parliament went in recess to avoid democratic debate on such controversial issue the financialtimes the us government was asked to delay the formal announcement till after the indian parliament had gone into recess because the government feared the sensitive issue could cause a fear among law makers eager to make political capital out of the issue the flooding of indian markets with 1429 products whose import was restricted to conserve scare foreign exchange and protect jobs and livelihood will have a devastating impact on the indian people women and the indian economy most items in the restricted list are agricultural products items produced in the smallscale household sector and animal products among the unrestrictedimports are carcasses and animals waste parts that create a threat to our culture and our public health it also includes fish milk coconut coffee spices tea ragi bajra neem products and even basmati this flood of imports will leave no aspect of the indian economy untouched the forcedremoval of restrictions on imports will induce high levels of cruelty against poor farmers and workers in the informal small sectors whose livelihoods will be snatched away by massproduced industrial products the dumping of meat products will also increase cruelty to animals as most animals are103slaughtered faster to create global meat markets especially in predominantly vegetarian societies like india impact of the removal of qrs on agriculture and farmers livelihood out of the 715 items from which qrs have been lifted from 1st april 2001 147 items are agricultural and dairy products the removal of qrs on agricultural commodities makes them vulnerable to global market prices and global competition global commodity prices are extremely volatile and in any case do not represent true competition on the basis of production costs because these marketsare controlled by global traders like cargill who receive overt and covert government subsidies from both exporting and importing governments the current fall in commodity prices in the global market is already being reflected in the countrys domestic prices the unrestricted access to the indianmarket given to the us through the usindia deal on unrestricted imports will threatened the lives and livelihoods of farmers weavers retailers and workers in every sector the quantitative restrictions have been removed at the time when the agricultural crisis created by farmers debts removal of subsidies corporate seed failures is forcing thousands of farmers tocommit suicide in punjab andhra pradesh karnataka maharashtra and other parts of the country thousands more are being forced to sell their kidneys and other body parts in order to survive adding to this crisis is the governments decision to dismantle the food corporation of india so that corporationscan move into the procurement and distribution sector even as farmers are reeling under the drastic fall in procurement price the government is subsidizing corporations for building silos cold storages and transportations facilities including ports through tax holidays low interest rates better creditfacilities and subsidizing infrastructure costs though the government boasts of protecting indian farmers and their interests but vast difference between the bound rates of the key agricultural commodities and the custom duty levied on them by our government shows its indifferent attitude towards our farmers on almost all the edible vegetablesand roots and tubers eg potato onions garlic leeks cauliflowers broccoli carrot turnips cucumber leguminous vegetable mushrooms beans spinach and others the bound rate of duty is fixed at 100 and the basic custom duty is only 35 again on edible fruits and nuts the bound duty limit is 100while the custom duty on a large number of items under this category is only 3540 on tea and coffee the bound rate of duty is 150 and the total custom duty fixed on these items is only 7680 on spices eg pepper cloves nutmeg mace and cardamom etc the maximum bound rate of duty is 150 which is generally on the crushed or grounded spices and on whole spices itis 100 however the basic custom duty on almost all spices is fixed at 35 on cereals the situation is very scary there is 0 bound duty on maize rice sorghum etc and the custom duty on these items varies from just 50 to 80 rice with a broken rice percentage of 50 or more has no duty on it this will push up rice imports at the time when the government isdismantling food corporation of india fci on grounds that there is too much rice in its stores104besides that there are several items with nil 0 custom duty eg rye barley oats on which the bound duty is 100 similarly dairy livestock and poultry are major agricultural activities which is not only generate employment but are also a formidable source of regular income throughout the year the removal of qrs on dairy products would hit hard the dairy activities in the state the basic custom duty limit onall these items is 35 and the total duty limit is 40 however on buttar and other fats and oils derived from milk cheese and curd the bound rate of duty is 40 and the basic custom duty is 35 on milk and cream concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetening matter the boundduty limit is just 0 but custom duty is fixed at 3560 in case of concentrated milk and cream rfste 2003 in punjab the impact of qr removal is quite apparent there the rate of the milk was rs 14 15liter in the beginning of 2000 generally the price of milk goes up during summer every year butwith the spread of news of cheap milk import the milk prices went down to rs 910liter the removal of import restrictions from poultry meat and egg products will have a serious impact on the domestic poultry industry though the present rate of duty on the poultry items is 100 as against the bound duty of 150 yet this would not check the dumping of cheaper importedproducts the price of chicken has already come down from rs100 to rs5560 indian poultry industry and farmers are particularly afraid of dumping of cheap chicken legs which is considered a delicacy here unlike in most western countries where the leg meat is virtually considered as a wastematter to be dumped at throwaway prices in developing countries removal of import restrictions on vegetable seeds will lead to surge in seed imports by multinational seed companies yet another danger of unbridled seed imports is the threat to the environment posed by ge seeds indian soils are already heavily contaminated with agricultural chemicals as are foodsthanks to the technology of the green revolution ge seeds such as monsantos roundup ready seeds will intensify the use of herbicides while their bt seeds will create plants that continuously produce poisons in the recent monsanto vs percy schmeiser case in canada the corporation agreedthat the use of ge seeds on one farm can contaminate the seeds and plants of neighbouring farmers through cross pollination wind and other factors the same case has provided evidence of how monsantos roundup ready rapeseed has displaced practically all the native biodiversity in rapeseed and its related varieties both cultivated and wild theuse of such seed can have a devastating effect on indian agriculture where the majority of farmers are small and marginal farmers who depend upon agricultural biodiversity for their livelihood in addition these seeds are patented in fact the monsanto vs percy schmeiser case has also set a historical precedent that decrees that farmers whose seeds were contaminated with ge patentedseeds with or without their knowledge cannot use or sell the crop as it belongs to the patent holder rather they will be fined heavily for not having paid royalty to the company ina country where farm105sizes are small contamination is bound to occur and the already debtladen farmer will be forced into further deprivation or suicide rfste 2003 the threat of ge seeds to the environment is so great that in march 2001 italys minister for agriculture ordered checks of 21 seed companies in a campaign against illegal ge material the suspected seeds were imported by monsanto and were already distributed to retailers italy hasforbidden the use of gmo seeds in open fields this ban exists in most eu countries thailand is the first asian country to ban ge crops australia is also planning a general moratorium and more stringent regulations on ge crops the worldwide resistance by farmers to ge crops is so strong thatge cotton was introduced into indonesia under military protection as against the low indian custom duty on the agricultural products the average tariff in oecd countries in 1995 were 214 for wheat 97 for barley 154 for maize their tariff peaks reach 350 and above in extreme cases for some products of interest to developing countries the most importantareas with highest tariff rates include the major agricultural staples cereals meat sugar milk butter and cheese as well as tobacco products and cotton in eu for instance the out of quota tariff for bananas is 180 in japan these tariffs range between 460 to 600 for dried beans peas and lentilsand in the us groundnuts in shell attract a tariff of 164 recently japan has levied a tariff of about 1000 on rice however in india the bound rate duties for rice and maize was fixed at 0 many years ago impact of removal of import restrictions collapse of edible oil sector the most damaging impact of liberalization has been on the edible oil industry the duty on the crude edible oil was reduced to 15 in august 1998 and only in june 2000 it was raised to 25 thisled to the closure of hundred of smallscale ghanies oil mills and expellers in 19992000 the custom duty on edible crude oil was 165 while on the refined edible oil the duty was 455 it was raised to just 75 and 85 respectively in the financial budget 20012002 even though the bound duty limit for edible oils except soya oil is 300 even sick vanaspati unitscan import crude palm oil cpo at only 55 duty the heavy import of palm oil has not only affected the mustard growers but domestic soya growers too in fact soya growers are in a worse position as the bound rate for tariffs is only 45 under the financial budget 20012001 the tariff for crude soya oil is even lower at just 35 themajor producers of soya argentina brazil and usa have had bumper crops as europe and japan the major importers of soya have rejected american soya because it may contain genetically engineered soya the ground is being laid for dumping this potentially hazardous product into india the impact of import liberalization is in terms of market and price destabilization the wt o language of surge in imports fails to reflect the fact that even small quantities of artificially cheap imports can perturb domestic markets and domestic prices even high value crops like spices tea and coffee have witnessed collapsing prices106without adequate safeguards of support our farmers have to deal with the destabilization of prices which occurs long before a surge of imports of agricultural products most items on the restricted list of imports on which qrs are now being removed are agricultural products items produced in the smallscale household sector and animal products the removal of restrictions on imports greatlyimpact small farmers and workers in the informal small sectors whose livelihoods will be snatched away by massproduced industrial products though it is argued by the government that tariffs or duties would be used to restrict imports the factual situation belief this assurance the crisis faced by the domestic edible oil sector is anotherexample after removal of import restrictions in 1998 there has been a reduction in the import duties on edible oils from 65 in 1995 to approximately 35 this has resulted in massive increase in oil imports imports of soyabean oil have increased from 236000 tonnes in 1997 98 to 8 00 000 in199899 in 2000 5500 000 tonnes of foreign palm oil soyabean oil and animal fat was imported by 20022003 india was importing 9400 million dollars worth of edible oils the mustard produced by our farmers which was selling at rs 2000 per quintal a year is today not even selling for rs900 per quintal the production of mustard seeds fallen by 65and over60 small oil mills and ghanis have been closed down rendering lacks of people unemployed similarly soya bean and palm oil have flooded the indian market destroying the domestic edible oil economy based on coconut the mustard the groundnut and the sesame this is why coconut farmers in kerala blockaded the cochin harbour and groundnut farmers in sirsi karnataka andsoyabean farmers in mutlai mp protected and were shot at in any case price collapse is not a linear mechanical phenomenon dependent on percentage of imports it is more appropriately described in terms of nonlinear perturbation in a complex system into chaos and disintegration therefore even in the case of products where the imports are low removal of import restrictions have sent the domestic prices into a downward spin leaving the producers in crisis and the agricultural economy in shambles lowering of price farm prices due to dumping of subsidized produce and fall in income dumping by usa and other developed nation the proactive of selling cheap products abroad at prices below the cost of production is called dumping agriculture dumping has made it impossible for many third world producers to thrive even in their national markets in conjunction with the export oriented conditionalities of structural adjustments imposed by the imf and the world bank which have obliged many governments to convert theirdomestic food production to agro industrial commodity crops in order to generate the foreign exchange with which to pay their debts dumping has made developing countries dependent upon food imports and extremely vulnerable to fluctuating prices in the world marketplace107since bretton woods dumping has been considered illegal article vi of the original gatt agreement defines and condemns dumping as can be seen in the text below article xi in the originalgatt text permits governments to adopt domestic supply management even allowing restrictions onimports that might favour domestic producers in order to control production levels and avoid thetemptation to export surpluses and to relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs general agreemernt on t ariffs and trade 1969 article vi paragraphs 1 and 2 antidumping and countervailing duties 1 the contracting parties recognize that dumping by which products of one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than the normal value of the products is to becondemned if it causes or threatens material injury to an established industry in the territory ofa contracting party or materially retards the establishment of a domestic industry for purposesof this article a product is to be

productfor the purposes of this article the margin of dumping is the price difference determined inaccordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 in the ensuing decades the impact of agricultural surpluses and falling farm prices in the united states caused ripples throughout the world due to dominant market position of the us food industrythe us target price became a virtual ceiling in the global marketplace agribusiness enjoyed low pricesworldwide for raw materials and cheap us grains flooded marketplaces throughout the world by 1986world cereal reserves held mainly by the us and europe reached 316 million tonsequivalent to aquarter of annual global consumption or 25 times annual world trade such dumping because legal with the conclusion of the uruguay round negotiations of the gatt under the new agreement signed in april 1994 countries are obliged over a period of six years108to phase out export subsidies by 21 per cent in volume and 36 per cent in monetary terms from the 198690 base period this is not a removal of subsidies it is a perpetuation of subsidies the uruguay round does not help farmers anywhere even in the north the agriculture agreement requires a 20 per cent reduction in each industrialized nations support for domestic producers over six years and a 133 per cent reduction over 10 years for developing countries all government farmprogrammes are to be added up as a single monetary value called the aggregate measure of support ams summing up that countrys annual budgetary and its friends in the congress have used the commitment to phase down the ams thereby leading to cutbacks in several support programmes thatencourage conservation wetlands protection and other environment friendly farming practices under gatt article vi a government that was found to be injured by the dumping of overly cheap goods can offset the economic damage by charging countervailing duties on them at the border but antidumping duties on agricultural products have never been assessed in part because theprotocol for provisional acceptance permitted countries to continue pregatt policies and in part because the governments often benefited from the opportunity to distribute cheap foods while the actually injured parties were peasants with little political clout the gatts provisions for antidumpinghave been widely applied in disputes over trade in industrial goods us antidumping law dates back to 1916 and has been used most frequently by the domestic steel industry to protect itself against imports in many cases those more cheaply produced by lower wage workers since a petition for an antidumping investigation is initiated by the concerned privateindustry usually one with strong political constituencies there is a strong incentive for the government to find both price discrimination and injury to the industry and to order the imposition of antidumping duties as per the wto provisions the eu which accounts for 40 percent of the world trade of dairy products should have reduce the subsidy on buttar from 1481 a tonne in 1990 to 1392 in 1995 with a commitment to reduce it to 947 in 2000 similarly on smp the subsidy was to reduce from 430 a tonne in 1990 to 406 in 1995 with a commitment to reduce it to 275 thus the commitmentof the eu has been to reduce 36 percent of the subsidies uniformly the us also committed to slashing subsidy on these products however looking at the behavior of the world prices of dairy products one gets a contrary picture instead of the world prices being pushed up as was believed they actually declined this isattributed to the increased subsidy by the eu and the us and to the policy of differential subsidy across the globe indians agriculture imports were of the order of 186 billion in 20002001 but they increased to 229 billion in the year 20012002 if the surge continues then the interests of the indian farmerswould be seriously affected the economic survey 20022003 makes a forthright statement india has considerable flexibility to counter flooding of the indian market by cheap agriculture imports through109the imposition of tariffs bound rates under wto wtos permissible tariff rates are reasonably high 112 percent for nuts 140 percent for sugar and coffee 100 percent for tea and cotton 70 to 100 percent for food grains 45 to 300 percent for edible oils and 40 to 50 percent for fruits countervailing duties can also be imposed to counter questionable subsidies given to agriculture products by theexporting countries apart from having the option of acting under safeguard provision to counter the surge of imports the per capita transfer to us farmers amounted to 29000 in 1995 in the main maize producing areas of mindano and cagayen valley the average per capita income amounts to leas than 300 so each us farmers receives in subsidies roughly hundred times the income of a maize farmer in philippines datt 2003 the developing countries are not allowed to increase their negligible level of export subsidies while the developed countries are allowed to maintain 64 percent of their subsidy out lay on the baselevel consequently agriculture imports from the developed countries are available at much below the market price in the domestic economy datt 2003 even before the wto mandate began to be asserted the government has been trying with the idea of opening the vast indian market for unrestricted imports of skimmed milk powder and milkproducts following the governments economic policy of liberalization milk powder which used to be on the restricted list for imports was put on the open general license in 199596 the open door policy to mncs has only placed the national milk grid in jeopardy us and eu will continue to flood anddump their highly subsidized milk and milk products into the unsuspecting developing countries like india which have little safeguard mechanism to protect their small dairy products new zealand with an import order of 12000 metric tonnes has already dumped a large quantity of buttar oil into india even after paying an import duty of 352 per cent the buttar oilimports have been at less than us 1000 per tonne against the prevailing global price of us 1300 per tonne in simple terms new zealands buttar oil is roughly cheaper by rs 15 a kg made available at rs 6454 per kg compared to the prevailing international prices of rs 8740 per kg and that toowhen new zealand claims not to be providing any subsidy to its dairy farmers the resulting crash in the domestic prices of buttar oil was therefore expected the price of buttar oil ghee before the recent import was in tile range of rs 100 to rs 120 per kg which has subsequently come down by 10 to 15 per cent while the consumers are happy the real price has tobe paid by the dairy farmers since the indian dairy farmers are paid on the basis of recovery of the fat in the milk has already suffered erosion in the milk value by 15 per cent jamaican farmers few years back spilled milk on the streets to protest against the dumping by the uk such protests will gradually be seen in india as the negative impact of trade policy becomesvisible the gain of the white revolution will soon filter away110increased trafficking of women one of the little known consequences of globalization and liberalization will be an increase in the trafficking of women as the number of girls decline the atrocities like rape molestation sexualharassment kidnapping will increase manifold girls will be afraid to leave their homes women willbe shackled at home nambisan 2004 according to

andiii the process of globalisation which has led to the commodification of women india is fast becoming a leading destination for sex tourism and sex trafficking justice ms sujata manohar of national human rights commission points out sex trafficking is a modern formof slavery one must plan beyond merely recruiting the victims because of they do not have the meansof income they will fall prey to the prostitution to survive according to a survey report even in the state like jharkhand nearly 50 percent of employed tribal women are subjected to physical and mental torture by their bosses the study vindicated thestand of the national commission for women that sexual harassment is prevalent in india one wouldtake this statement further that harassment is aggravated by economic deprivation das gupta 2004 significantly large number of sexual harassment cases is reported from tamil nadu and andhra pradesh a study of the number of cases reported under the immoral traffic prevention act impliesthat prostitution thrives in tamil nadu andhra pradesh and karnataka as 90 percent of the cases havebeen reported from here menon 2002 like most offences crime against women caw is steadily on the rise in the country of the total crimes committed in the country seven percent constitute caw this may not be alarming at firstsight but the point is that many crimes are not reported kidnapping and abduction of women topsthe list in 1999of the total crime against women about 67 percent cases of kidnapping and abductionwere reported a significant feature is that 54 percent of the victims were less than 18 years menon2002 women in the rural areas are not even aware of their legal rights but even those who know the law find that even the most horrifying cases take a twist by the time they

decline in the states of punjab and haryana this decline does not correspond with any substantial increase in the contraceptive use it is in fact as a result of selective sex abortions in fact the decline in the sex ratiois in the age group zero to six across india times of india 6th november 2001 significantly social studies indicate that the bias against female progeny is most prevalent between the well off jat and jat sikh community sikh whose ancestors few centuries ago were jat but adopted sikhism even the demand for dowry is highest among them purely materialistic factorscombine to weigh against the female sex perpetuating the prejudice against it the two primary facts are first the patriarchal desire to keep land and property within the family by simply eliminating daughters before birth second excessive pressures for dowry followed by bargaining consumerismdutt 2004 the ultimatum issued by the akal t akht the sikh vatican on april 13 2001 against the practice of female foeticide came in the wake of the 2001 census showing that indias most prosperous state also had the most skewed malefemale ratio the census focused attention on fatehgarh sahib districtas having the lowest child sex ratio in the country with 754 to 1000 however the fatwa seems to have yielded little results though ostracism faces those who flout the order of the akal t akhat the highest religious authority of the sikhs dutt 2004 the sex ratio in the age group of 06 years has declined sharply from 945 females per 1000 males in 1991 to 927 females in 2001 except kerala tripura mizoram sikkim and lakshadweep the worrying trend is that the female foeticide is not confirmed to north india but spreading fast to the south of the country in the states like andhra pradesh tamil nadu and karnataka even in the statelike karnataka in belgaum bagalkot and bidar the sex ratio has been falling it is 921 females per 1000 males in the small taluk like cikodi it is as low as 879 and 873 in gokak radhika 2004 the decline has been particularly sharp in union territories of daman and diu from 969 to 709 anddadra and nagar haveli from 952 to 811 the decline is also alarming in some prosperous states like punjab haryana and gujarat punjab with the highest per capita income has the lowest sex ratio of 793 females per 1000 males in the 06 age group times of india 5th may 2001112falling sex ratio is definitely a matter of concern for instance in kakhrod village in jind district of haryana there are about 500 men who are past marriageable age as they are unable to find brides because there are few women around panicker 2002 the dearth of girls as compared to boys of marriageable age has served to revive the practice of bride price being paid by grooms families in this it is not dowry that has to be paid in fact thereis flourishing trade in supplying girls of different castes from poorer state such as bengal bihar madhya pradesh assam and orrisa not all such alliances succeed owing to incompatibility often these girls are pushed into prostitution dutt 2004 in haryana in some villages the grooms get thebride by paying just rs 5000 from orissa or assam while a buffalo of good breed may cost about rs 40000 in 1991 not a single district in india had been recorded with a child sex ratio of less than 800 in 2001there were 14 and the number of district with the child sex ratio between 800849 increasedto 31 during the same period ten worst district with a child sex ratio of less than 800 are in punjab and haryana the two of indias wealthiest states fatehgarh sahib gurdaspur patiala mansa kapurthala bhatinda and sangrur in punjab ambala sonipat and kurukshetra in haryana sharma 2004 it is increasing from the rich to poor from upper castes to scheduled castes scs and scheduled tribes sts among the scheduled castes scs and scheduled tribes sts where the average child ratio has always been higher than in general population and better than the national average it has begun to dip substantially thus while in 1991 the child sex ratio for sts was 985 against a nationalaverage of 945 in 2001 it has fallen to 973 and amongst scs the figure were 946 in 1991 and 938 in 2001 sharma 2004 the prenatal diagnostic technique pndt act came into being in 1994 it stipulates that ultrasound and other techniques be used only to detect foetal abnormalities in the hands of rightpeople it has made childbirth safer but the act has not achieved what it proposed to doctors simply put up a notice that sex determination is banned and then continue to do it doctors are a protected species committed activists have exposed the erring doctors only to find that the police is notpermitted to take action a government appointed medical team deals with the offence and in most cases the scandal is covered medical council of india mci indian medical association ima and other such bodies should take stringent action against the doctors involved in foeticide unfortunatelythese bodies act like trade unions only to protect the doctors and clinics the forced bachelorhood on the boys will have grave consequences old bachelors will be forced into marginalized life without any selfesteem in the house of distant relatives thus according to psychologist they could add to the problems affecting their physical and mental health the consequencesof declining sex ratio are already visible in haryana were the elders have started asking social workers and politicians to find brides for the village boys while there is no proven correlation between bachelorhood and the crime the pressure value of the institution of the marriage is said to be a crime113deterrent people in the bas village of hissar district in haryana complain that crime rate has gone up in direct proportion to the number of bachelors push karma 2002 the decline sex ratio will play have with the social fabric of the country leading to social tensions female foeticide will disempower indian women fewer girls will also mean that their child hood their marriage and their future will come under a variety of social and physical threats whereonly those who have power wealth and influence will dictate their choices in life vasudev 2003 the census commissioner rightly observes in his report one thing is clear the imbalance that has set in at this early age group is difficult to remove and would remain to haunt the population for a long time to come to say least the demographically the sex ratio of 927 of the population in theage group zero to six does not appear to augur well for the future to come

food grains productionrespectively similarly in case of oilseeds this ratio is of the order of 70 15 and 15 normally area coverage under kharif rabi and summer seasons is around 69 lakh hectares 31 lakh hectares and 6 lakh hectares respectively agricultural production since late 1950s production of cereals has increased three times it was 3035 lakh tones and now ranges 90100 lakh tones this is largely due to increase in production of rice maize and ragiproduction of tur and bengalgram has increased substantially and has been important factor inincrease of pulse production from 34 lakh tones to 89 lakh tones in recent years total food grainsproduction has increased from 3804 lakh tones 195556 to 10960 lakh tones in the year 200001 oilseed production was highest 1889 lakh tones in 199394 on account of introduction ofsunflower crop but the same has seen a declining trend due to availability of cheaper imported edibleoils production of cotton also increased three folds from 301 lakh bales 195556 to 1009 takhbales in 199697 but in recent years the same has been declining due to less area coverage anddiversion of area to maize and sunflower production of sugarcane has increased

from about 56 quintals to about 18 quintals per hectare this mainly due to increase in the yield rate of rice ragi and maize productivity of pulses has increased marginally 45 quintals from 25 to 30

were only set up in the 1820s following british investment as the number of british growers increased cultivation was steadily extended throughout karnataka and a large plantation of 1200 hectares was established in the 1870smost coffee planted in the early years was arabica mainly the old chicks variety that apparently inherited the bean qualities of the original mokka introduced by a muslim pilgrim baba budan in chickmanglur arabica cultivation reached its early peak during the 1860s but this coincided with majoroutbreaks of pests and diseases such as white stem borer and coffee leaf rust there was an epidemic of coffee leaf rust in 1889 due to this the productivity and output declined and poor prices added to the decline to counteract falling yields enterprising planters introduced seeds from other originsand some planters tried to select and evolve diseaseresistant arabica one of the most promising types developed was kents which became popular robusta was introduced from indochina at the end of the nineteenth century for planting in estates at lower altitudes coffee profile of india 2003 coffee in the economy coffee contributes between 3 and 4 percent of the gdp

outbreak of a viral disease pests and diseases arabica and robusta coffees in india are susceptible to fungal diseases arabica is more susceptible to pest and disease than robusta coffee leaf rust caused by the fungus hemileia vastatrix is the major disease in arabica the second most important disease affecting with arabica and robusta is black rot caused by the fungus koleroga noxia white stem borer xylotrechusquadripes is the most serious pest of arabica coffee in india and it is prevalent in all coffeegrowing areas another endemic pest is mealybugs planococcus sp coffee berry borer hypothenemus hampei affects the berries resulting in heavy crop loss coffee guide 2003125labour requirement coffee production in india is labour intensive as in some other countries it is estimated that the equivalent of some 551000 workers are employed on daily basis the total estimated labour requirement for a hectare of yielding plantation of arabica and robusta respectively are 495 man days and 330 man days per year on farm processing it consists of the preparation of dry cherry and parchment dry cherry is prepared by sun drying the fruits and spreading them evenly on the drying grounds tiled concrete or mudplastered yards only ripe fruits can be used for wet processing these are pulped by machinery which removes the fruit skin the mucilage is removed later by machinery originally the mucilage wasremoved by natural fermentation but this is no longer popular moisture standards are confirmed by sampling normally the cherry would be fully dry at the end of 12 to 15 days under bright weather conditions the prescribed moisture standard for arabica is 105 percent and 11 percent for robusta most robusta is prepared by the dry method offfarm processing there are presently 73 licensed privately owned curingprocessing factories most of the factories are well equipped and are able to process the best quality coffee the quality standards instituted by the board are used by all processors for exports and domestic consumption marketing structure and marketing channel until 199293 coffee marketing was wholly administered and regulated by the coffee board reflecting government policy and responding to the views of the growers a process of liberalization was initiated by the board during 199293 an internal sale quota isq was introduced this allowedgrowers to sell 30 percent of their output directly to the domestic market a free sale quota fsq replaced the isq in 199394 which allowed growers to sell 50 percent to the domestic market or export directly the fsq was increased to 100 percent to small growers and 70 percent for largegrowers in 199495 in the subsequent season large growers were also given 100 percent fsq now all restrictions have been abolished as a consequence the coffee board has devised new roles for the changed free market situation the activities of the coffee board have been considerably reduced following the drive to full market liberalization both large and small growers are now free to market their coffee in any way they choose nevertheless the coffee board undertakes a variety of roles to the benefit of the industry in general liberalization has meant that the future activities of the board will be focused in the areasof research and development quality control market intelligence and information market promotion extension and free market development current scenario coffee from the growers is purchased at approximately 40 local buying centers many major and smaller buyers are represented at each center most small growers prefer tosell coffee in the form of dry cherry and parchment large growers and estates sell coffee in green and graded form either directly to exporters or by private auction domestic distribution of coffee takes place through wholesale and retail roasters126consequent to dismantling of auctions by the board less than 10 percent of coffee is sold through the private auction fortnightly auctions are held by the indian coffee traders association icta since 1993 at bangalore which facilitate growers to sell their graded coffees however as most growers prefer to sell their unprocessed crop directly to exporters or roasters the scope for auctioninggreen coffee at the moment remains comparatively limited grover prices estimated grower prices after liberalization of the market during 19952001 are given in t able26 increased output will depend to a very large extent on the prices received by growers there was a general decline in prices received by growers until 199192 prices then moderatelyrecovered before rising sharply following the brazilian frost and drought of 1994 grover prices were comparatively higher during 1995 to 1998 seasons and price has

export earnings 19992000 was particularly impressive owing to better volumes in spite of reduced international prices and unit value export picked up during this period due to higher exportable production owing to falling international prices the export value came down to 1050 crores during200102 from 1375 crores of the previous year which represented a fall of 325 crores 24 in terms of unit value of exports all the grades including instant showed an appreciable decline ranging from 29 in the case of instant coffee to 60 in the case of plantation grades the overall decline for all coffees in prices was 48 this has reflected on the export earnings of 200102 domestic consumption domestic consumption which is not currently expanding is mainly confined to the producing states with use in tamil nadu almost half of the total and karnataka according for 30 percent the total estimated demand of coffee in india now is about 65000 tonnes consumption was almost stagnating for the past one decade around 60000 tonnes and showed amarginal decline consequent to domestic retail price hikes in 1993 and 1994 though the current per capita consumption is about 60 gms is very low good potential exists for its growth many small gourmet roasters as well as some big private corporate roasters cater to the local market nestle andhindustan lever is the major manufactures of soluble coffee with the gaining of popularity of cafes in the metros in the recent years coffee is establishing itself as a life style product in the long run this may help to prop up the otherwise stagnant market127with the international coffee organization disbanded and the quota regime gone indian producers were left to themselves to compete for a market coffee prices dropped from their highs and producers had to take massive cuts in profits srinivasan 2004 coffee exports from the beginning of the year 2003 till the end of may 2003 stood at 65149 tonnes as against 119 lakh tones during the sameperiod in 2002 besides rupee appreciation has played its role in impacting the exports with export prices denominated in dollars a stronger rupee lends to lower returns to farmers and reduces selling interest realization for growers in rupee terms had dropped by close to eight percent in 2003compared to the previous of 2002 kulkarni 2003 coffee growers who are facing a droughtlike condition apart from battling the crisis due to poor prices have urged the government to waive the interest on loan under the special coffee term loan sctl scheme in a representation made to the reserve bank of india growers said that thewaiver of interest extended to the agriculture sector in the droughthit states should also be made applicable to the coffee sector kulkarni 2003 field study karnataka is one such state in india where lots of lands are under plantation crops the most common plantation crops in the state of karnataka are coffee banana spices cocoa vanilla coconut and areca nut coffee is grown mostly in chikmagalur hassan and coorg districts chikmagalur district is the first to grow coffee in india the cultivation of coffee has an eventful background it is said that coffee was introduced around 1670 ad by one baba budan he is reported to have brought coffee seeds from yemen and raised seedling on the hills of chikmagalur later the seedlings were supplied to coorg andkerala chikmagalur is preeminently mountainous with a flat projection in the east this hilly malnad tract full of rich forest is renowned for its coffee plantations the large area of this district is malnad ie a largely forested hilly region of heavy rainfall the landscape of the tract is highly enchanting theslopes of the mountains hills here are replete with fascinating natural beauty they are clad with thick forests through which the shining streams wind their way fertilizing the narrow valleys and glades the western part of the district is covered with some of the dense and most useful forests of the countrythe forests clothe the hilly sides densely and give the muchneeded shelter for coffee cultivation the district is rich in forest resources gazette of chickmagalur 2003 soil in this part of the district is of poor acidic type though relatively poor the soil is well suited for the growth of plantation crops like coffee coffee is a selfpollinating plant and the fruits are called berries coffee plant usually 7 to 8 years old before it bears a full crop coffee is a perennial and an annual crop grows best at altitudes ranging from 3600 to 8000 feet in tropical climate128the coffee varieties commonly cultivated in these districts is arabica robusta cauvery and 795 coffee plants have a life span of 50 to 60 years arabica variety is widely cultivated as it yields better and the seed fetch a good price in the market this variety is of international standard and most demanded variety by traders robusta is a sturdy variety which was the only variety grown earlier butnow only few grow this variety robusta grows to a height of 5 to 6 feet this variety yields lesser and the price it fetches in market is also less coffee produced in india is only 3 of the international produce and 198 of worlds export it earned rs 324 crores from the coffee exports in 1991 and the same exports increased to rs 1868crores in 1998 but then decreased to rs 1682 crores in 2000 and it stood at rs 1112

influence of wto on coffee plantation many planters are of the opinion that mo has affected them to a large extent they feel that due to the open market system a planter cannot sell coffee at a higher price as against the fixed pricebecause the trader or the buyer has an option of buying from other markets like china and vietnam where the coffee prices are low mrs chitra subbaiah a planter from coorg and secretary of kodugu women coffee awareness board feels that mo has killed them she said that the local traders whom they had to sell theirproduce were cheating them and buying from external markets as the prices were very low there due to low cost labour she blamed the political leadership for their short sightedness for signing the mo agreement she asserted that india does not need mo129rudrappa a planter form sakleshpur hassan district blamed wto for the current economic distress in the coffee plantation he feels the planters were not trained to meet the requirements of international standard which mo has specified he said if the coffee is dried in the yard it is not acceptable to the trader as he prefers only machine dry which the small farmers like him cannot meetthe traders fix the price and do not take the cost of production into consideration so the industry is running at a loss he said rudrappa says we have to give labour all the facilities while our incomes are low and that is the reason why we have reduced the permanent labour and have gonein for contract labour he painfully said that now the planters are unable to manage the estates and there are more than 500 estates that are available for sale ramachandra a small farmer of shanthahalli coorg district blamed mo for coffee board not giving any subsidy for manure the subsidy would have helped the planters in a big way at this hourof crisis and to overcome their difficulties narayan alva of sakleshpur taluk hassan district said that the planters are at the receiving end when the coffee prices shot up between 1995 to 1997 the daily wage rate of labour increased but now when the price of coffee has reduced the wages remain the same so maintenance of permanentlabour has posed a lot of problem for the planters and the present distress has forced them to go in for contract labour instead of permanent labour chandre gowda of aralguppe chikkagalue district said in thee year 1995 when the coffee prices started soaring high the planters started buying more lands and borrowed heavily from banksfor further investment on lands but when the coffee prices reduced from 1998 on wards that caused problems to them as they could not service their debts virtually this has put them in a debt trap banks are no longer lending them and are not meeting their financial requirements which they badly needin this hour of crisis he said many for our both big and small farmers have become bankrupt it is difficult for the planters to survive as he is in debts because of rise in cost of agricultural products like fertilizers and pesticides mr chandre gowda said some of the planters in districts of chikmagalur hassan and coorg although are not aware of the problems posed by wto but blame the government policies for their miseries they could not point out exactly as to what has gone wrong with the coffee plantation and fall in prices the crisis in coffee plantation and fall in prices ahs made planters to go in for alternative crop cultivation like vanilla rice banana amla and ginger hariprasad who owns 75 acres of land in aldoor in chikmagalur district sold part of his land to repay the bank loan as he could not maintain his plantation as the yield couldnt fetch him a compensatory price to maintain his family which became difficult and to supplement his income he had to start a hotel mk murthy of aldoor chikmagalur district blames liberalization as the root cause for the present economic crisis among planters and drop in prices of coffee he blames the open market130system that has given the traders the power to fix the coffee prices this has in turn ruined the planters and the coffee industry the planters have become pawns in the hands of the profit hungry traders who care hoots for the interest of the planters naseer ahmad of hosahalli sakleshpur taluk hassan district and a small farmer who owns 15 acres of coffee plantation has not been able to cope up with the present recession his revenue peracre earlier was between rs 25000 to rs 28000 but now although his expenses are rs 20000 his earning is only rs 8000 per acre so he is under severe loss this led him to sell his tractor and jeep to clear his loans in desperation he is planning to change over to vanilla cultivationas the expenses incurred per acre is lesser compared to coffee earlier he earned from sale of orange and pepper but due to less rains the orange trees have dried up and pepper is infested with pests dm shanker of agalguppe village has about 150 acres of coffee plantation he is maintaining 40 per permanent laboures according to shankar heavy labour is required during periods of sprayingmanuring picking weeding and sanding coffee is labour intensive and requires 365 days care government policies have not helped the planters but government has provided for the labour class with free education free meals for students and monthly ration at affordable prices so a labourer can sustain but it is difficult for an estate owner to survive as he is in debts because of risein the cost of agricultural products like fertilizers and pesticides bank policies have misled the planters as during 1994 and 1996 the prices of coffee reached its peak but the banks instead of guiding the planters to go in for fixed deposits the bank provided them with more loans this has created havoc as the planters further invested in purchase of land tocultivate more coffee that would fetch the more profits the bank lent for 100 acre estate 100 crore loans though the planters had surplus income they have borrowed and spent heavily on luxury items now with the coffee prices falling low the planters are unable to repay the bank this created animbalance now he has started borrowing from outside sources at high interest rates to pay the bank interests earlier coffee used to be bought by the coffee board but now the planters are independent and sell their produce to the traders the prices are fixed according to the quality in the year 2000 the coffee industry requested the government and the bank to exempt 1700 crore borrowed by the planters if this is exempted then the planters can survive otherwise the whole industry will collapse if the planter does not repay he is considered as non performing applicant npa is this status is declared then the planter is unable to raise funds from any other financial institution or othersources the karnataka government to certain extent has exempted the borrowing from small banks but borrowers of nationalized banks face the problem 2003 was the lowest crop and 2004 is the worst year for a coffee planter131prema of agal khan estate in agalguppa village has 100 acres of coffee plantation according to prema annual expenses on estate per acre rs 15000 to 20000 expenses includes labour minimum rs 12000 per labour wages rs 65 for both men and women marinating permanent 30 labourers providing medical water shelter higher education for their children during wedding etcearlier 80 labourers but now cut short to the abovementioned number manuring both premonsoon and post monsoon rs 1000 per spray per acre pesticide spraying twice per barrel rs 125 8 to 10 barrel requirement per acre to break even half ton coffee yield is required arabica coffee is sold at rs 50000 to rs 55000 per ton at the present rate coffee islabour intensive and requires 365 days care regular checking for stem borer attacks coffee everything is preventive and timely measures are necessary heavy labour required during periods of spraying manuring picking weeding and shading women psychological do not commit to hard work government policies have not helped the planters but government has provided for the labour class with free education free meals for students and monthly ration at affordable prices so a labourer can sustain but it is difficult for estate owner to survive as he is in debts because of rise in the cost of agricultural products like fertilizers and pesticides the woes of small farmers are more acute than the big farmers due to liberalization and globalization the cost of production has go up due to use of machinery for drying of coffee and the global competition has brought down the prices says nisar ahmed the planters of coorg faced similar problems by cultivating coffee the planters earlier grew only cardamom but due to shortfall in rains many of them had shifted to growing coffee even thisproved a curse to them fall in coffee prices has increased their miseries high rate of interest from banks has made them bankrupt most of the planters have not paid back even the interest and they want further investment which the banks are not ready to give rajanna in shanthalli village of coorg district has 20 acres with include 5 acre of coffee and 15 acre of cardamom earlier only cardamom was cultivated but due to less rains shifted to coffee but the shifting has caused them problems as it is not feasible to cultivate coffee even now cardamom fetches good price 4 acres of land is leased out for paddy cultivation the yield is shared between thetwo so paddy is only sufficient for selfconsumption and labour are paid rs 60 for women and 100 for men one acre cardamom gets 10000 income but rate fluctuations are there but if the crop is good the income earned is good for the past two years the cardamom crops has been bad due tothis 2lakh loan has been incurred coffee has not yielded any income at all ramchandra of shanthalli village has 15 acres cardamom and 10 acres of coffee 20 years back only cardamom but then shifted to coffee 20 labourers permanent 65 to men and 50 to women cardamom sold to the spice board so the prices are fixed but we have been able to clear all our loanscoffee does not yield well due to less rain we have compensated our income by renting out a house which fetches an additional income every month132the small planters in coorg district are changing to ginger cultivation as they feel that it will fetch them a good price some other planters want to shift to vanilla cultivation will that be a solution or is it an escape many are not sure unaware of wto blame government some of the planters in chikmagalur coorg and hassan districts are not aware of wto and dont have the knowledge about the effects it has brought about on their lives however they blame the government both centre and state and their policies for fall in coffee prices in late 1990s andbeginning of 2000 they blame the open market system and the traders who fix the price of coffee are responsible for this down fall in prices the planters point out that our own traders have spoilt the international market for they purchase less priced coffee from china and vietnam and this has causeda decline in indian coffee prices it may be pointed out here that the planters are not aware of the changes in government policies which has come about after the introduction of new economic policies from 199192 onwards under the influence of wto which has resulted in throwing open markets forworld wide competition failure to educate planters coffee board has also not made efforts to educate the planters about the changes that have come about in the world scenario in the field of coffee trading and this partially jeopardized the interest of the planters the transition from total control of the coffee board to open market system virtually at the mercy of the traders has been very quick and planters have not been able to cope upwith these fastchanging policies the small planters are the most affected ones by these changes as they neither have required capital nor technical knowhow the high rate of bank interest that did not come down in level with international bank rate put the planters in grave financial crisis in additionto the fall in international coffee prices the banks did not bring down the lending rate of interest which was as high as 16 to 21 till recently banks were liberal in lending to the planters during the boom period of 1995 to 98 as they were getting more profits but later squeezed the credit totally inthe period of crisis 1999 to 2003 had the banks brought down the interest rate in the year 1998 onwards the planters would not have been in present soup additional factor another additional factor which has increased the cost of production for the planters is the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides earlier the planters were using farmyard manure green manure and compost which were available in plenty with virtually no cost but the use of chemical fertilizersin recent years to increase production has increased the cost of production and contributed to their financial burden planters seem to have become addicted to using of chemical fertilizers and pesticides that are easily available in the market instead of labourious process of preparing organic manureplenty of money in the boom period made them blind and take recourse to easy methods unmindful of consequences and financial burden133the government policies have not helped the farmers infact they have affected adversely the planters the government has to provide for the labour class with housing maintenance and the basic facilities but the estate owners pay for all these facilities the government has to certain extent provide labour with free education and monthly ration at affordable price so a labour can sustainsays k t surendra a big planter he adds but now labourer are facing problem as the planters have reduced hiring labour which has created unemployment it is difficult for an estate owner to survive as he is debts because of rise in the cost in the agricultural inputs some of the owners to raise income for paying interest to bank are cutting timber which affect ecology irrigation is required because of variation of monsoon even drinking water has become theproblem and may of the planters buy water by purchasing tankers for domestic use the area is known as giri area and landslides are very common which affects in crop failure conclusion wto has affected owners to a large extent due to the open market system the planters cannot sell coffee at a higher price as against the fixed price because of the trader or the buyer has an option of purchasing from other markets like china vietnam where the prices are low 2003 wasthe lowest crop and 2004 is the worst year for coffee planters the financial situation is very bad as the whole economy of this area is dependent on coffee if the present situation continuous the whole coffee plantation will collapse and that will affect the survival of labourers mostly women with the international coffee organization disbanded any the quota regime gone indian producers were left to themselves to compete for a market coffee prices dropped from their highs and producershad to take massive cuts in profits coffee exports from the beginning of the year 2003 till the end of may 2003 stood at 65149 tonnes as against 119 lakh tones during the same period in 2002 besides rupee appreciation has played its role in impacting the exports with export prices denominatedin dollars a stronger rupee lends to lower returns to farmers and reduces selling interest it has revealed that the spread and depth of hunger are more in the areas with deficit production and the areas with a large number of people dependent on casual employment as in kerala tamil nadu gujarat and maharashtra though these are premia facie not among the poorest of the states the other factors that contribute to the depth of hunger appear to be lack of nonagricultural employmentopportunities and low wages to the labour as in the case of madhya pradesh and bihar effects of wto on the coffee plantations in karnataka need in depth study not all planters are aware of the impact of the wto and global economic policies on coffee industry the changes have been quick and the planters response to these changes has been no adequate preparation to meet the challenges of new economic policies the planters like the farmers are in a debt trap the openmarket system dependency on traders banks for their finance and use of chemical fertilizers has caused havoc on their lives the consequent change has affected the plantation labour in a big way and has worsened their economic conditions permanent labour is a causality giving way to contract labour mechanization has led to cut in working days of labour and their income134the plantation labour also has suffered extensively due to distress economic situation that has effected the coffee plantations the average working days of the labour largely women has reduced by 30 which was earlier put at 240 working days per year the reduction in the average working days per year of the women has resulted in reduction of their annual income this means although theminimum wages remained the same their incomes have reduced and decline in their standard of living causing a great hardship public hearing in karnataka the karnataka rajya raita sanga in collaboration with the national commission for women ncw new delhi diverse women for diversity dwd new delhi and research foundation for science t echnology and ecology rfste new delhi organized the public hearing of rural women on19th july 2004 at mandya district in karnataka state the main objective of the public hearing was to document the experience of rural women in the background of globalization and wto agreements the public hearing was conducted which aimed at mobilizing the solutions from among the affectedwomen themselves which would constitute an important input for formulating prowomen agriculture development policies thus this program is an important event in empowering women in decision making and provided them a forum to express how and why they have been marginalized and what needs to be done to bringthem in the main stream of development around 250 rural women participated they could speak of the entire gamut of their problems general as well as those pertaining to seed agriculture food and water out of 27 districts of the state rural women representatives had came from 16 districts including the faraway northern districts of the state which account for highest number of farmers suicide members of different women organizations were also present and many of them spoke about their problems similarly women artists environmentalists students rural women and others expressedtheir grievances the very fact that these women spoke from 10 am to 600 pm reflects how vocal these women were the feeble voices of women usually unheard at home sounded like thunderbolts on the dias such a huge gathering of rural women and men itself justices the public hearing as aptand timely eminent personalities from diverse field such as journalist activists academicians advocates raita sangha activists and ngo representatives were present on the dias since 1991 in the wake of globalization and wto agreements the poor strata of the society have been suffering immensely women who constitute the poorest of the poor suffered moredisproportionately the wto import on indian agriculture made them suffer much more their hardship and suffering have increased they are suffering as producers consumers as agricultural labourers and cultivators problems of drinking water have also increased their hardship sometimes it became difficult to distinguish between gender issues in general and then problems as producers and consumers hence it was not easy to pin down exactly the wto impact on rural135women however all the speakers did point out that since 1990 their problems have assumed alarming rates both in terms of depth of realty and its coverage or area spread highlights of public hearing the role of women and their participation in silkworm rearing and the related sericulture work is quite significant but they are not happy with low prices for their output and also the price fluctuations one of the speakers commented that they grow silk but cant afford to wear a silk sari they demanded fair and stable prices for their production all women felt that they cannot flight individually and collective action is a must they stated that unless they are united and organized they couldnt effectively fight for justice and to prevent exploitation depletion and drying up of ground water resources attracted serious attention from almost all the speakers smt g b sudha a lawyer by profession narrated the incidence of acuteshortage of water in bagur village of hassan district when the women of the village protested against some mismanagement of water from hemavathi reservoir police resorted to the use of brutal force where in many women sustained injuries and few of them wereeven arrested by the police however the government announced compensation at the behest of some political leaders the compensation was given to such persons who were not involved in the protest thus there was injustice in the distribution of compensation more women representatives from bellary district explained the hardship of women labourers who work for a very low wage they also referred to wage discrimination based on sex they felt that only through women organizations and self help groups such injustice can be done away with member of spandhana a women organization of mandhya district narrated a few rape cases of rural women where the culprits have gone scot frere on account of the influence of their money and power a new thinking on such problem is a must from different perspectives including societal and governmental it is quite satisfying to know that many of the rural women felt that marriage is not the solution for all problems of women rather it is only a beginning they said that all solutions to their problems liein their education thus the need for women education received top priority in the public hearing programs k u devi from janavadi mahila sangha of mandhya district spoke about increasing family violence and sexual harassment of women in both organized and unorganized sectors police and law can do very little in this respect the solution lies in social awareness so she expressed the need for creating such awareness in the society through differentmechanisms136 majority of the speakers felt that from the past one decade the prices of most goods and services have gone up health services are expensive education is expensive seeds and fertilizers are expensive and hence the cost of even rural living has increased however there is no steady source of income the cost of agriculture has also gone up significantlyalthough they couldnt directly and precisely establish the link between price rise and globalisation the pointers are towards globalization most women from districts of northern karnataka bidar bijapur gulbarga and gadag narrated their nightmearing experiences of rain failure crop failure and farmers suicideleaving the entire burden of the family on women since several studies have indentified the positive links between wto agreements globalization and crop failure well the influence could be that globalization has caused immense misery to women in general and ruralwomen in particular they told that hybrid seeds genetically engineed seeds from seed banks are not dependable they are prone to frequent diseases hence demand the use of too much peticides which are expensive even the pests have become immune to pesticides this derives farmers tosuicide mrs sujatha nagaraj from mandya stated that the cost of agriculturer has gone up sericulture subsidies are beset with lot of procedural difficulties and dairying demands huge capital milk societies do not purchase all the milk produced by the households andhence disposing off the excess production is the greatest problem she mentioned that milk price is less than the price of a litre of mineral water similarly marketing of vegetables especially tomatoes are the greatest problem facing the rural women she attracted theattention of the audience towards management of surplus production smt chayadevi from hassan district dislcussed the problem of potato crop production of which is costly and cropis highly unreliable the farmer gets around rs 600 to 700 per quintal where as a retailer pay rs 14 to 15 per kg the potato chips cost rs 100 perkg where as raw potato costs very less why this difference is so hige what is the missing link a serious points to ponder by experts of agribusiness management several of the speakers mentioned about dowry deaths female foeticide and marginalisation of women in decisionmaking one speaker made heartbreaking statement in future a female child will lose its right to born when human rights movement are gaining popularity how to reconciles to this kind of a situation t rue that there are disparities in wages based on sex however there are also regional disparities in wages laboureres in north karnataka gets rs 15 to 20 per person per day where as in southern districts it varies from rs 60 to 70 there fore labour migration istaking place from low wage to highwage districts137 smt madhu bhusan an artist of vimochana a women forum stated that commercialization of agriculture has led to more exploitation of women in terms of dowry increasing drinking habit among men unethical influence of mass media on women which may not really empower them instead make them vulnerable she also referred to cultutral erosion bynarrating one incidence of a tribal group called hakkipakki in karnataka especially rural women from bijapur district said that five rivers are flowing in their district but water problem is very acute their argument is we have resources at our doorstep but we are not entitled to use them what the government is doing theirelected representatives are grossly useless they stated majority of the speakers felt that both education and health services are expensive and they cannot afford to buy them and their primary schools and health centers are ill equipped and are not functioning properly they felt that alcoholism among men is increasing significantly these days which has made the life of women more pathetic although this cannot be directly linked to globalization commercialization of agriculture invariably contributed to an increase in alcoholism in this way an indirect link can be established suggestions emerged from public hearing remunerative prices for agricultural goods emphasis on water harvesting focus on the supply of drinking water and sanitation creating awareness among women regarding the adverse impact of globalisation on agriculture strengthening of women organizations increasing agricultural wages necessary state intervention in this matter is desirable women are allowed to retain their lright over their seeds reducing the cost of education and health services better marketing infrastructure a strong movement to preserve the ecosystem and the native culture no privatization of water resources equal and free access to common property resources cprs involvement of locals by participatory methods strict penal punishment for cases of cases of crop failure due to defective seeds and pesticides sensitizing the police legal system and the concerned personnel regarding womens problem plugging the loopholes in the anti dowry act138 making agricultural credit more simple and reachable organizing more such public hearing of the grievances of women frequently and at different places dr vandana shiva director dwd in her address to the participants suggested that women should have a right over the seeds they should fight for freedom from credit and just price for their products many of the women activists also felt that there is a need to change the present law which allows the wife to inherit her husbands property only after his death they argued that even when the husband is alive when the family breaks down she must be entitled to have half of the property owned by her husband13922 west bengal apart from paddy jute and mesta is the main crop in west bengal west bengal also produces about 22 of the total tea production in india the fibre crops have traditionally been produced incountries where labour is abundant and cheap as a result the production systems have been simple and labour intensive role of jute in the countrys economy lies in the fact that more than 4 million farm families mostly in west bengal are involved in jute farming and majority of them belong to smalland marginal categories importance of the crop can further be assessed from the fact that cultivation of these crops generates employment seasonal of more than 10 million mandays per person industrial operations of about 73 jute mills in the country are a vital segment of the national economy in addition about 05 million people are involved in raw jute and finished goods trading and ancillary activities india has a large demand of packaging material for storage and transportation of food grains and other marketable commodities such demand was 14351 thousand metric tonnes for the year 20002001 after fulfilling such a huge demand india exported 2551 thousand metric tonnesof jute goods during 20002001 in about 120 countries of the world valued at rs 93171 crore being a natural fibre jute is biodegradable and as such environment friendly the principal products such as sacks can be reused and as a result may have a secondary value for other users despite such positive features the world market for jute has remained depressed in recent years world production of jute has been about 3 million tonnes per year of which 300000 tonnes are traded internationally in the form of raw fibre and 900000 tonnes in the form of products in the mid 1960s about 20 percent of the worlds jute was processed in developed regions this share has now fallen to around 5 percent this decline results from the increased concentration of juteprocessing industries in the major producing and consuming countries of asia coupled with a decline in overall consumption elsewhere because of the spread of synthetics products socioeconomy jute cultivation is primarily restricted to india and bangladesh accounting approximately for 66 percent and 25 percent respectively of the world production jute is grown on around 1 millionhectareland the land area under jute cultivation has grown twofold since independence while the production has gone up by 35 times research and development work carried out by the agricultural scientists during this period has not only resulted in increasing yield kgha of the fibre but also in improvement140of the fibre quality and shortening the cultivation period investigations reveal that the crop pattern jutepaddypotato is more profitable for the farmers than say paddypotatosesame the principal outlet of the jute products is in the packaging sector the compulsory jute packaging act of government of india is however in the process of dilution giving way to synthetic product in the sector jute fabrics are widely used in india for packaging food grains sugar pulses andseeds special food grade jute bags have been developed for satisfying stringent international norms of safety jute shopping bags of various shapes sizes and designs are nowadays a common sight in many towns and cities jutegeotextiles are being increasingly used in india to solve many geotechnicalproblems in fact the biodegradability of the substance is viewed as a very welcome feature as after the useful lifespan the material can decompose and merge with the surrounding soil it is claimed that in this process the soil is also enriched jute composites are increasingly being used in the railwaysand in the building sector as weed substitute relatively simple labour intensive and sometimes very crude techniques are used to convert the fibres into the products listed here although for some products for instance jute based carpets somewhat sophisticated technologies are employed any cost relief provided by the trading practicesas also fiscal measures of the concerned authorities would help the jute and coir sectors to survive most of jute products manufactured in india are consumed in the domestic market thus during 200102 out of 1615 thousand tonnes of goods produced in the jute sector only 180 thousand tonnes ca 11 percent were exported the export earning from the jute sector accounted at the turn of themillennium for a meager 03 percent of indias export earnings one of the major constraints to export is the high share of freight costs to the landed price sen and saha 2004 if projected state wise

bengal providing employment to 200000 workers directly and approximately 40 lakh jute growers are also dependent on this industry of these 59 mills 5 mills are run by national jute manufacturing corporation nmjc limited and one by thegovernment of west bengal of late this industry has been witnessing widespread workers unrest against the most barbaric repression of the jute barons lockout was declared in 17 mills and only 10 have been reopened out of these ten in some mills the management forced the unions to agree to141very adverse terms and conditions to lift the lockout again in some mills wages were reduced for all categories of workers with the increasing trend of layoff closure and downsizing of jute mills the employment scenario continued to be grim the number of factories and the total employment remained stagnant in recent years the average daily employment for the years 1996 1997 1998 and 1999 was 935503889857 891179 and 885788 respectively while the number of factories in the same period was 11047 11238 11441 and 11720 respectively the employment of women in factories is gradually decreasing the average daily employment of women workers in the years from 1995 to

affected due to non supply of raw jute and other inputs as the government of india has curtailed budgetary support for this purpose resulting inincrease in its losses the workers and staff are not

the last five years production has been growing steadily at 2 percent since 1995 the tea industry provides direct employment for one million workers of which asizeable number are western bariah 2002 more than two million persons derive their livelihood from ancillary activities associated with production value addition and marketing of tea substantial foreign exchange earnings rs 1850 crores with negligible import content and contribution to the state and central exchequers rs 1100crores are the other significant economic features of the indian tea industry india is the worlds largest consumer of tea consuming over 600 million kg annually per capita consumption is 660 grams per annum with a penetration rate of 772 percent urban penetration 90 percent and rural penetration 726 percent tea continues to be the most popular and widelyconsumed beverage within the country consequently india is only the 4th largest exporter in the world export performance has declined in recent times since 1998 the export volume has dropped at a cagr of 1 percent and export value dropped at a cagr of 9 percent until 198788 tea was the most significant export item from india by accounting for 207 percent it ranked number one among agricultural exports but thereafter it started declining and now it occupies the 3rd position by contributing 88 percent of the total agricultural exports similarly its contribution to gdp has declined from 124 percent in 195051 to 033 percent in 200001 export of the indian tea in the early fifties had 45 percent share in the world market it was the time when exports were at modest 206 million this started showing downward trends from 1998 onwards when indias share slipped to 17 percent in the export market there has been wide fluctuation143in the export volumes ever since but the dismal export performance was much pronounced in 2000 the experts witnessed a sharp decline from 542 million in 1998 to 424 million in 2000 this further went down in 200203 touching 2098 million in rupee terms the earnings eroded from rs 29184 crore in 199899 to rs 111036 crore in 200203 sustained low quantity of exports has brought it down to 14 percent of the worlds exportmarket the worst happened when the cis countries biggest export market of indian tea undertook a paradigm shift in the buying patterns by its increased bias towards ctc varieties ironically the preferred export commodity accounted only to 20 percent of the indian crop at approximately 160million kg leaving the country with small quantity of export crop the lost market has been captured by competitors mainly sri lanka which makes high value orthodox varieties to be blended with low value fillers collected from india sri lanka has established its branded dilmah packet teas in russia indias major market it is now selling teas at rs 15 from rs 25 much below the cost of production the southern region comprising of tamil nadu kerala and karnataka produces roughly 24 percent of the

over 3 percent since 1995 world absorption has grown at a cagr of 25 percent in the same period leading to worldwide softening of tea prices reduced price realizations are threatening the profitability of producers the world over declining exports and increasing production place tremendous pressure on prices leading to continued loss in profitability loss in foreign exchange earnings the health of the industry thus has an immediate socioeconomic impact in the remotely located tea growing areas of the country it is144therefore critical for the industry to immediately adopt sustainable and low cost developmental strategy for improving production as india shines the rs 5000 crore worth tea industry losses its sheen with price realization down and costs rising in 2003 several violent incident and lockout were reported across the tea industry the loss at least 50000 man days gokhale 2003 a survey conducted recently has indicated that the small tea grower is getting a very small share of the total price paid by the consumer since the bought leaf factories as well as the small tea growers belongs to an unorganized sector of teaproduction their transactions are not very coherent and well structured and lack group action and bargaining power starvation kills hundreds of tea garden workers in west bengal around 800 tea garden workers have died of starvation with several surviving on wild roots and rats in west bengal where the closure of uneconomic plantations has rendered a million labourersjobless says a rights group the deaths resulted from a combination of starvation malnutrition general debility and diseases among workers in abandoned tea gardens in north bengal at least 25 tea gardens in north bengal were closed during the past three years turning more than a million workers jobless after theirmanagements decided to shut down operations citing poor economic viability there are an estimated 160 gardens in north bengal which accounts for about 30 percent of indias annual tea production of 823 million kg but the sagging global market for tea has drastically impacted india the 15 billionayear india industry is tottering following a crash in

kohinoor tea estate so that many gardens have been closed for 12 years t o work in these plantations young men and women were recruited from chotanagpur tribal villages thus the tea worker population today is chiefly comprised by tribals like the oraon munda and santal in recent years nepali workers have also joined the labor force in these estates according to a 1983 survey the number of permanent tea workers in dooars was 150707 of which over 50were women about the same number of women are employed on temporary assignments during the period april october the task of tea leaf plucking

with wages and food rations became irregular for most plantations even before closure living in the middle of nowhere withno work other than that available in the tea plantations workers and their families have been suffering from malnutrition anaemia and other nutrition related problems combined with the lack of medical treatment the results have been drastic according to the agriculture minister of west bengal kamalguha stated that 320 workers have died of starvation in the last one year besides 50000 workers of 14 tea plantations are passing their days in distress having been denied food electricity medicines and other amenities for months together khitish goswami a leader from the rsp another partnerin the ruling left front placed the deaths at 450 according to a survey done by their labour union citu state secretary chittabrata majumdar owing allegiance to cpim the largest party in the ruling coalition also said that tea plantation workers did not have food or medicine for many monthsand no other means of livelihood so they must have died due to malnutrition and lack of medical care source the telegraph nov 23 2003 upon closure of the plantations the food rations for the workers have stopped as tea plantations are in very interior areas with their workers living on the plantation itself the abandonment of theplantation by the owners and managers has spelt disaster for the workers a direct consequence of this plight is that severe under nutrition and high child mortality rates are now prevalent in most tea gardens electricity has been cut off and as the water supply was electricity dependent this has meantthat workers receive no drinking water the labour lines are far away from any other habitation and therefore any other source of drinking water workers have in some cases have to depend on river water that is unfit for drinking purposes the women are the worst victims because they have not only lostthe paltry wages rs 1015 a day for the temporary worker from the tea estates but also have to gather food and fetch water from a distant water source for their families in order to overcome the problem of the workers the jalpaiguri district magistrate after discussion with the fci food department unions and management sent a proposal for a continuationof the pubic distribution system pds to the state government on 7th november 2003 his contention was that foodgrains for these families are already available with the fci because the tea estates used148to procure the food grains from fci until closure and therefore no additional allocation of food grains was necessary his suggestion was the family ration cards provided by the plantation management be treated as temporary bpl ration cards and that the workers be tagged to the concerned ration dealersdirectly he suggested that the state government provide subsidized food grains to the families against these cards the state government has not taken any decision on this suggestion so far source sramik samhati kendra mmeo 2004 case studies of farmers of west bengal the agricultural scenario in the state of west bengal is one of declining crop yield and increasing strife for small holding peasant farmers subsistence farmers find it imperative to search for a secondaryoccupation and many of them seasonally migrate as wage labourer in neighbouring districts over the past decade 19942004 the use of agrochemicals in farms has increased at least two times in the state monsanto company has introduced its glyphosate herbicide to rice farms although its use is most intensive in tea gardens of north bengal the drive for earning more has pushed all subsistence farmers to growing at least one cash crop like potato sugarcane and jute while traditional multiple cropping system involved cultivation of several oil seeds pulses and vegetables modern monoculture of rice or wheat has eroded the local crop diversity farmers are crucially dependent on hybrid seeds supplied by the government and mncsthis in recent years has occasioned several disastrous results for the farmers in what follows we describe a few cases of agricultural setbacks as a result of selected cash crops potato the profit cost ratio for potato according to state agriculture officers is 102 this narrow margin of profit and the high production cost makes potato farming a highly riskprone venture for most farmers the risk has proved itself in a spate of farmer suicides in dinhata of coochbehardistrict jamalpur of bardhaman district and chandrakona of medinipur district all in the period marchapril 2004 in the case of potato it is not less production that has caused farmer suicides on the contrary it is overproduction which belies the prevalent myth that more production means prosperity overproductionof potato has often caused strife and hunger among farmers biman adhikari president of kishan sabha of chandrakona recalls back in 1997 an overharvest of potato caused a dramatic fall in prices women of farmer households used to hide all vials of pesticiqes from their menfolk in 199899 the cost of production was rs 1209000 per acre in 20032004 it has doubled to rs 2400000 per acre yield has been at about 120 quintals per acre the state production figures reveal that the total production of potato was 8500000 ton however the cold storage capacity is only 4200000 ton market glut contributed by overproduction results in distress sale after home consumption of the produce most of the remaining potatoes are sold at a throwaway price even 050 paise per kg149shib choudhury of birbhanpur of chandrakona block of medinipur district committed suicide because he failed to sell his produce all middlemen refused to buy his potatoes because all the cold stores were full to the brim rekha choudhury widow of shib choudhury recalled how he had been depressed when he saw the potatoes rotting in the fields even his attempts to sell them at a distresssale price failed because there were no buyer nimai poira of khetua of medinipur district also attempted to commit suicide his wife bandana rushed into the room and snatched the bottle of pesticide away from him nimai reported that he had borrowed rs 18000 from the cooperative society and another 6000 from friends in addition i hadsold off rice from the previous season to collect rs 12000 only to farm potato and now the wholesalers refuse to take anything what should we do sheikh saifuddin of hosenpur bardhaman district also committed suicide on the 13th april when inquired about the incident the district superintendent of police became angry with the reportersare the press reporters willing to turn this state into andhra pradesh saira bibi widow of saifuddin reported that he had borrowed a huge sum of rs 48000 from jot sri ram samabay samiti and rs 22000 from various sources on the 13th a mahajan came to his house to ask for repayment of his loan saifuddin went out with him after an hour he returnedhome and drank a bottle of pesticide the hailstorm of the 12th and 19th march perished all the crop of farmers like saifuddin most of the farmers are now unable to repay the loan and consequently cannot begin sowing of jute while most of the potato has perished in the hailstorm the remaining produce cannot be sold because thereis no buyer in coochbehar too overproduction of potato is a cause of concern for both farmers and wholesalers most farmers have failed to sell their produce those who have been fortunate to sell have paid rs 80 per quintal of potato just to keep their potatoes in cold stores after having borne the costof production rs 24000 per acre the cost of transport and cold storage charges farmers have incurred a great loss sunflower this season agriculture officers gave sunflower seeds to farmers in medinipur and bardhaman districts as an alternative cash crop the state seed corporation ssc procured hybrid sunflower seeds from sheetal a private firm based in bangalore the hybrid variety surya51 is reported to be a highyielding but has turned outto be a disaster for farmers of bardhaman and medinipur the crop plants flowered well but yielded no seeds on the 24th may 2004 depressed farmers of chandrakona block in medinipur district burned their sunflower plants to ashes in 3 acres of land the agriculture department is in jitters after

growing sunflower on their farms return to sustainable agricultural practice a case study from bankura district in kalyanpur village of bankura district farmers have realized the futility of growing modern hyv rice the escalating cost of production and the diminishing crop output has made rice farming a discouraging venture farmers report that every year they are facing persistent occurrence of pest insects which had earlier been only a minor problem they had to substantially increase both thedosage and frequency of pesticides application but that would kill the whole range of beneficial organisms asit dey a middle aged farmer of kalyanpur is the first of the villagers to have stopped chemical agriculture he remembered his doctors warning some 15 years ago that he had fallen sickdue to pesticideapplied rice and vegetables since 1990 he stopped growing hyv cereals and using chemical pesticides i find that my health has improved ever since we stopped eating hyv rice he said his wife maya says that she can now enjoy the real taste of traditional rice varieties asit kalmaand dahar nagra because her family has abandoned growing the bland hyvs asit grows rice in a dry upland farm he cannot afford to grow bora summer rice after the aman winter rice harvest bora rice needs a lot of water which is a scarcity in the area in the summer thus he has begun growing mustard and sesame because neither requires irrigation andboth can be cultivated after the oman harvest moreover these oilseeds provide nutrients to the farm maya his wife is a strong support in his decision to change over to traditional crop seeds asit also is a breeder he collected a local variety from mediniput and improved its characteristics by selective breeding fellow farmers of the village have named the variety asit kalma the navdanya team conducted two farmer workshops in kalyanpur in 2002 and persuaded farmers to stop chemical agriculture after an assurance of technical support in the event of pest or disease outbreak 20 farmer households of the village started organic farming involving folk crop varieties organic inputs and rotation of various crops asit deys farm served as a model for the newconverts in 2003 the crop output was more than satisfactory in asits farm the yield of asit kalma was at par with the swarna a hyv rice grown on his neighbours farm at a comparatively miniscule151production cost this success convinced all the villagers and most of them have now stopped growing hyvs with his decade of experience of positive results from organic farming asit dey is convinced that growing folk rice varieties following traditional techniques of organic cultivation is profitable healthy and ecologically sustainable at any workshop and meeting with farmers asit is a source ofinspiration for the young generation of farmers he has dissuaded young farmers from using herbicides and pesticides in the village farms globalizations impact on farmers in west bengal the focal impact of globalisation on agriculture has percolated to several aspects of the rural economy as well the cultural aspirations and lifestyles are intricately linked to livelihoods therefore the impact of globalization is likely to be perceived in the rural cultural milieu t o understand the reallife situation at the grass roots level a small survey was conducted in the state of west bengal change in household income from agriculture over the period from 1994 to 2004 was estimated as the increase or decrease in the profit margin the profit margin here is defined as the difference between the sale price of crop produce and the total cost of production including seed cost and costof agrochemical inputs and labour in case of negative value in the profit margin it is imperative that the farmer would either borrow from a local moneylender or bank sell off or mortgage hisher property or migrate to other districts in search of a secondary livelihood the overall result shows a definite decline in the percentage growth in profit margin over the decade 19942004 in jalpaiguri district a staggering 86 of farmers have experienced a decline in the rate of farm income in bankura district this proportion is 82 and in howrah district it is 563 of the sampled number of households all small holders have incurred a fall in profit margin evenamong these wealthy farmers several have experienced a reduction in profit margin over the decade however for a handful of farmers profit margin has been positive implying that profit margin has increased but such positive change has been fortuitous and confined to rich farmers only 18 ofbankura farmers and 44 of howrah farmers have made a higher profit margin in 2004 than in 1994 a positive growth in profit margin has taken place on farms where crop diversification was practiced in howrah a greater proportion of farmers experienced positive growth in profit margin because farmers there have turned away from rice monocultures and are growing a diversity of cropshowever the profit margin is not particularly high in diversified farms because a the crop output was reduced due to pest attack and b the market price of the produce fell the pest attack in most of the farms was not controlled by the use of synthetic pesticides which only increased the cost ofproduction in one instance the production cost was considerably reduced resulting in 112 rise in profit margin a similar instance was found in howrah district who owned 5 bigha of land her insistence on eliminating chemical pesticides caused a 198 increase in profit margin152the amount of loans has increased over the past 10 years the source of loans may be banks various government credit schemes and private moneylenders farmers make loans primarily to buy costly agrochemicals and implements like diesel pump sets and hand trawlers another reason for borrowing is a daughters marriage marriage on dowry is rampant even among the scheduled casecommunities who earlier observed the custom of bride price the widespread custom of dowry compels the farmer to make a huge amount of loan just in order to climb the social ladder of prestige the above analysis shows that over the period 19942004 the drive for market liberalization and globalization has severely impinged on the rural household economies the traditional mode of agriculturalpractices has been obliterated of course the green revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s had already set in the process of replacing all traditional farming knowledge and practices of seed saving however the recent economic system giving a free had to mncs in agricultural sector has caused arapid shrinkage of the traditional practices and replacement of folk crop varieties by hyvs and hybrid varieties this has obviously escalated the cost of agricultural production while stagnating productivity besides theyre a direct financial deficit of the farmers household economy which is a macrocosmic reflection of the national fiscal situation rising costs of inputs declining productivity of crops plummetingmarket price of farm produce breakdown of the state protection of farmers interests through withdrawal of state subsidies and the loss of farmers control over means and conditions of production have resulted in a general decline in the profit margin from agricultural activity the study shows thatsmaller the holding the greater the decline in profit margin public hearing in west bengal the public hearing began at 11 am after 138 participants from different parts of the state had arrived in small groups owing to a thunderstorm that disrupted railway overhead cables in south bengal the previous night many women from south 24 parganas were unable to arrive the participants hailed from bankura birbhum east medinipur west medinipur nadia purulia north 24 paganas andsouth 24 parganas districts a majority of them were farmers but a few represented a section of migrant labourers who had been dispossessed of their lands by industrialization and modernization drives over the past decade all participants belonged to networks of shramajibi samiti sms madhyamgramand centre for interdisciplinary studies cis barrackpore the panel of the public hearing was composed of dr vandana shiva recipient of the right livelihood award and fao medal eminent writer mahasweta devi winner of sahitya academy award poetcolumnist jaya mitra renowned activist sri samar bagchi and ecologist dr debal deb karuna prasad a poet and singer inaugurated the program with two songs his songs were composed on the themes of bio piracy of indian crops and herbs by mncs and the urgency of saving local crop genetic diversity in her introductory address dr shiva explained the objective of the public hearing we shall hear and document the womens first hand accounts of the impacts of globalisation on their lives and153livelihoods she said a part of the four such public hearing is of social importance because it is the women of bengal who spearheaded the famous tebhaga movement of the 1940s she recalled whose slogan reverberated pran debo tobu dhan debo na we shall give our lives but never our rice dr shiva spoke in hindi and renowned bengali writer jaya mitra translated her words dr shiva told the women that it is the bengal women who upheld and secured their rights to land and crops of their labour through much sacrifice i am hopeful that i shall the women of bengal who have retained the legacy and spirit of tebhaga i know there are certain areas of west bengal where many farmers are still growing indigenous crop varieties outside the encapsulating system ofmodern industrial agriculture i know there are many communities who resist and defy the destructive forces of modernization the market and globalisation we are here to record the womens experience of the struggle against aggressive inroads of mncs into our culture dr shiva called on the participantsto brood another freedom struggle to protect womens rights over land occupation and culture she informed the participants that the ncw will organize a national conference of women in delhi where opinions of west bengal women will be considered as a major contribution to the future policy making exercise mahasweta devi in her speech recalled that many farmer women had sacrificed their lives in kakdwip of south bengal during the tebhaga movement she recalled that the women of t ebhaga had taken the bold oath to preserve their seeds sown in our blood and refused to give the share of their farm produce to landlords mahasweta devi said that the british rule had manufactured the bengalfamine by hoarding food grains and stepping up food prices t oday a new type of famine is being manufactured by the globalised market she warned mahasweta devi eloquently explained to the participants the plight of indigenous people in west bengal and other states she told how processesof commercialization and modernization have dislodged traditional land use systems and have intensified the exploitation of women leading to unforeseen consequences for both indigenous people and their resources globalisation is destroying all natural resources she said on which the rural poordepend for survival real estate developers are filling up wetlands earlier people knew which ponds water was good for drinking and cooking now the ponds and the knowledge of sustainable use of these ponds are vanishing nevertheless it is the poor women who are capable of resisting the processof destruction women of dinajpur have stopped an attempt to dam the punarnava river it is these women upholding the legacy of t ebhaga martyr ahalya who march in the forefront in the struggle of resistance to imperialism she called upon the participants to fight as mighty women in many partsof the world do the evil force of globalisation dr debal deb of cis described how the wto has opened the floodgate of bio piracy of the wealth of biodiversity and traditional knowledge pertaining to the use of local biodiversity he explained that the current globalisation process began with the green revolution which sought to compel thecountrys farmers to depend on multinational corporations for seeds agrochemical inputs and pump sets for irrigation within 30 years of the green revolution he said thousands of folk crop genetic154diversity indigenous knowledge of sustainable land use and traditional systems of food security disappeared following wto this process of destruction has been intensified by untested gm seeds and toxic agrochemicals he recalled that the green revolution had sought to increase food production and eliminate poverty and hunger he noted that bumper production of cereals has led to rotting of foodgrains in warehouses while endemic hunger in pockets of orissa andhra pradesh and maharashtra persists he said t oday we all witness that even bumper production of food crops lead to indebtedness poverty and suicides of farmers overproduction of rice tomato and potato over the past decade hasnot reduced food prices on the market but has drastically reduced the sale price of farm produce resulting in a cascade of farmer suicides dr deb added that the wto has paved the way for enclosing and commercialising common property resources and stealing the traditional knowledge base pertaining to local biodiversity dr debtermed globalisation as a regime of plunder of resources of the poor for the prosperity of the corporate empire he pointed out that bio piracy of local knowledge began with the basmati rice neem and turmeric the latest instance being the indian wheat variety whose patent is held by monsantohe estimated that over 160 indigenous crops and herbs and their traditional uses have been patented as corporate innovations he called on all participants to rise against this regime of bio piracy and the political system that fosters and facilitates corporate plunder of the nations resources sri samar bagchi of napm expressed concern that under the regime of wto the indian farmers will soon lose their autonomy and become enslaved by mncs for the supply of seeds agrochemicals and implements he called on all participants to freely share their experiences and boldly express their opinions which will be documented for discussion at the union government level in delhi a total of 17 women including 2 santal women recounted and shared their first hand experiences of enclosure of the commons displacement from ancestral land drastic changes in traditional land use practices they clearly linked these changes to plummeting water table salinisation of soil rising cost of foods and loss of livelihoods their accounts gave a different set of instances of india shining a different portrait of industrial progress which was coupled with illegal land transfer marginalization and prostitutionalization of women and disentitlement of the poor kalpana sardar of north parganas district said that exportoriented prawn farming has destroyed farmers livelihoods in the sundarban area fertile crop lands have become converted into shrimpfarms entry of salt water into rice farms has destroyed farm productivity prawn farms have also reduced farm labour employment opportunities she told that 100 bigha 33 acres of rice farm requires 2700 labourers whereas the same amount of jalkar where tiger prawns are farmed employsjust 15 labourers emigration of villagers is on the rise in search of employment many women are driven to prostitution to save their families from hunger jahanara bibi and palina pramanik of minakhan block of north 24 parganas district reiterated kalpanas account and added women of our villages are all unemployed ever since the beginning of155farming of tiger prawns salinisation of land has led to the disappearance of brushwood for fuel household expenses for fuel have escalated because people must buy kerosene oil they reported that while small farmers are willing to grow rice for subsistence they couldnt afford to sow crops because of leakage of salt water from neighbouring prawn farms of rich farmers they also recounted storiesof sexual harassment of women who are employed in tiger prawn processing units budhu tudu a santal woman from west medinipur district revealed in her account another side of exploitation of women the introduction of machines like tractors and threshers has reduced employment of women in farm work those who are employed do not receive the wage at the ratestipulated by the government and have to work overtime in order to make two ends meet she further added that chemical agriculture has poisoned all cultivated crops as well as wild edible plants small fish and even drinking water fazila bibi from nadia district reported that monocultures of commercial crops like sunflower has replaced in her area a wide diversity of rice pulses and vegetable crops which has ensured food and nutritional security to the rural poor in the past the womens speeches were interspersed with traditional folk songs sms participants also recited many mass songs they composed on the theme of farmers rights sms women also staged a drama skirt in which they identified globalization as erosion of biodiversity loss of seeds loss of farmers rights commercialization and devaluing women and fattening of industrialists shikha mandal from kulpi block of south 24 parganas district described another instance of development that fosters and exacerbates poverty she said local people were losing employmentbecause work is afoot to build a port in kulpi about 60000 bigha of farm plots will be taken over by the port authority this will disemploy and displace thousands of local people suniti bhattacharya from bishnupur block of bankura district articulated how the ongoing process of modernization of agriculture has destroyed traditional knowledge of seed saving and sustainablefarming she told that womens traditional knowledge of drying and storing seeds in earthen pots of protecting them from pest attack and retaining viability of the seeds are now being forgotten in the past she said women decided which varieties of rice would be grown in their home gardens andfarms to provide nutrition for their family members modern marketdependence of farmers for seed supply has robbed women of their decision making power the introduction of hyv seeds and machines has marginalized womens role in production and hence devalued the this devaluation is reflected inthe abolition of brideprice customs in many indigenous societies and in the rising frequency of dowry crimes ashalata das from south 24 parganas reported that traditional fishers have lost their occupation because of crocodile project in the area the local people are migrating out to distant townships insearch of employment156minati mandal from namkhana block of south 24 parganas district gave a similar account of shrinkage of employment opportunities in her area she went on to say that overuse of pesticides has adverse health effects on the livestock as well as humans especially children her account revealed another aspect of india shining the number of tube wells is less than one each for 250 or morepeople water table is falling drinking water is becoming saline and contaminates with arsenic government health centres no longer distribute medicines for common ailments joynur bibi from pathar pratima block of south 24 parganas district recalled that in her childhood she has seen irrigation systems using surface water that was sufficient to feed everyone in the villageover years of negligence the village ponds and tanks have dried up with their water holding capacity significantly reduced rich farmers are using electric pumps to extract ground water for boro summer rice cultivation intensification of hyu rice has replaced vegetable diversity on farms she said thatproductivity of farms has declined over the past decade and agriculture has become too expensive pesticides fail to adequately control crop pests she added with bitter jest people use them with greater confidence to commit suicide joynur bibi went on to say that village panchayat bodies to indulge in political favouritism and corruption manipulate bpl lists thus benefits of various governmental programs of rural development do not reach the poor each poor family is entitled to receiving 35kg of rice under the antyodaya yojana the old are supposed to get 10 kg of rice free under the annapurna yojana a sum of rs 500is allotted for poor women who are pregnant however in reality the poor families hardly receive any such benefits while indira abas yojana allots rs 22000 for building a house for each poor family they receive rs 10000 after signing a voucher of rs 22000 maya tanti from the same block reported that the use of syhthetic fertilizers has caused compaction of the soil and loss of soil fertility t ehmina begum from north 24 parganas said that in her area prawn farming and cultivation of hyv tomato and capsicum have engendered the farmers livelihoods fertile farms are rendered useless by saltwater infiltration and conversion into prawn fishery in the remanding croplands hybridcapsicum farming has replaced red chilli which were even a few years ago dried and powdered for sale on local markets women who used to earn from red chilli processing are losing their income because of capsicum ashalata maiti from sagar island reported that the ganga sagar mela was this year contracted out to sahara company which raised the fares of all transport vehicles and the rent of space for vendors space was too costly for the small businessmen and poor women to sell their wares at the mela the company is also evicting local inhabitants to leave space for erecting a powerhouse andother structures she added that safe drinking water and cooking was a scarcity on the island and the number of tube wells is too small for everyones needs people find it imperative to use dirty pond waters for cooking she told and therefore waterborne diseases are common157at the end of the hearing noted writer jaya mitra observed that we are now compelled to contemplate our rights over water land and forest it is ironic she said that in a land that receives very high rainfall people have to buy water to irrigate their lands and that in a land of rich biodiversity farmers are buying earthworms to enrich their farm soil mitra cited an instance of the impact of globalisation on village economies of bengal an average village community spends rs 200000 towards cigarettes and cosmetics she urged that women get over such fads and look into their real needs the songs recited by sms and cis members concluded the hearingdr shiva said that todays public hearing made it clear that globalisation had caused several problems for survival for the poor and that the women are themselves aware of these problems theymust find ways to tackle and overcome these problems themselves we from navdanya shall of course stand by them as we have always stood by rural women in their struggles but the decision and the means to struggle is theirs india will shine not by the colourful advertisements of mncs nor by thedazzling lies of politicians but by the brilliant invincible people of india she concluded in the valedictory address dr debal deb said that reliance on the government to solve all the problems is fruitless dr deb further asserted we cannot expect a corrupt government to protect the countrys food security women are the repository of the wealth of our agro biodiversity and traditionalecological knowledge they are capable of protecting this wealth from plunder they can save our cultures159 public hearing held in ludhiana punjab16123 punjab punjab the state of rivers and canals known as the granary of india is located in the north west of india with only 15 of geographical area of the country it produces around 22 of wheat10 of rice and 8 of cotton of the country punjab has been contributing around 50 of the rice and 65 of wheat to the central pool for more than decades of the total geographical areas 23 is under cultivation with a cropping intensity of 186 the state has been largest tractor population in the country and the highest per hectareconsumption of fertilizer and 96 of the cultivable area is under canal and tube well irrigation hence agriculture in punjab is not really dependent on the monsoons directorate of agriculture 2002 punjab of the total area under wheat in the country 13 is in punjab and 36 in uttar pradesh it is interested to note that wheat area in the punjab 322 mha is slightly less than that in madhya pradesh 35 mha but the production in punjab 122 mt is more than double that of madhya pradesh 55 mt thereby highlighting the interstate difference in yield per hectare during 20002001 punjab produced 15550 lac tonnes of wheat 9154 lac tonnes of rice 204 lac tonnes of cotton and 9760 lac tonnes of sugarcane in addition to the conventional crops the main fruits grown are kinnoworange 194720 tonnes mango 56080 tonnes grapes 129316 tonnes lichi 11460 tonnes and lemon 4676 tonnes the main vegetables grown in punjab are potato 1371516 tonnes root crops 129316 tonnescabbage 15184 tonnes cauliflower 78041 tonnes and brinjal 33201 tonnes as per the survey conducted by the national productivity council of india the availability of crop residues in punjab has been of the order of about 300 lac tonnes which is approximately 10 of the total availability of crop residue in the country the major crop residues are rice straw wheat strawand cotton stalks in addition large quantities of agro industrial residuesby products are also available viz rice husk generated in rice mills and bagase by the sugarcane mills situated in the state t o promote the agriculture in the state the punjab government has launched a number of schemes under t echnology mission and second push scheme in agriculture schemes under technology mission intensive cotton development programme162 national pulse development programme oil seed production programme schemes under second push in agriculture promotion of maize cultivation promotion of summer moong cultivation program to boost sugarcane production despite warnings about receding water tables and the futility of continuing with the wheatpaddy rotation farmers in the paddy belt continue to repose their faith in the water thirsty crop reports coming in from the vast fields of central punjab a typical paddygrowing belt reveal that the area under paddy this year is not going to show any significant decrease much against the hopes of theagriculture department bhatt 2004 rather in some parts the area which was traditionally under sugarcane is also likely to come under paddy if one takes into account the disillusionment among the farmers in view of the sugarcane fiasco in the state in patiala district the sathi variety of paddy which takes only about two months to mature has been planted in acres of land particularly in the samana block at fatehgarh sahib about 100 hectares of the early variety has been sown while in ludhiana the crop has already covered a good 1000 hectares by now in gerozepur too nearly 500 acres of area has already come under earlyvarieties of paddy this despite the fact that the johl committees recommendations of paying compensation for keeping fields free from paddy wheat variety have been accepted in principle and the modalities are being worked out the water level all over punjab is going down drastically by about two to three feet every year in ludhiana in places like pakhowal block where farmers used to get water at an average depth of 4050 feet are going in for submersible pumps this year because the water level has further gone down the situation is the same in other paddy growing districts including ferozpur where the average fall is between 1 to 2 feet and patiala where the average fall is between 70 cms to 4 metres agriculture department sources revealed that in dera bassi block a fall of four metres was reported this year but the area under paddy was expected to remain the same here as well the water wastage is maximum during this period because of rapid evaporation of water from the fields other problems like power shortage and pumps going dry because of ground water depletion also hit the farmers during this period but the farmers do not heed the recommendations under the impression that the crop planted during this period when the day length is more increases the yieldof the crop163farmers reveal that the johl committee recommendations would work well with them only in case the compensation money was enhanced from rs 2500 per acre being offered now growing paddy with less water in punjab the demand of water to meet the present production level is about 437 lakh hectare meter lhm out of this 145 lakh hectare meter is supplied by surface canals where as groundwater recharge provides about 168 lakh hectare meter of water but excessive demand of 124 lakh meterof water is met through over exploitation of the ground water by pumping it out with the help of 95 lakh tube wells it has created worst situation in the state as centrifugal pumps in 28 of the states area are estimates to be replaced with submersible pumps as more than 45 per cent farmers of thestate are marginal and small having less than 2 hectares of land holdings it is impossible for them to install these high cost submersible pumps water standing in the fields during premonsoon months of may and june increases atmospheric humidity which enhances the incidence of pests and diseases and further increases the cost ofproduction more over puddling operation in ponded water before transplantation compacts the sub soil affecting the growth of roots of subsequent crops nearly a sixth of worlds total rice grown as upland rice the largest areas of upland rice are found in india indonesia bangladesh china and philippines direct seeding of rice is practiced inparts of assam west bengal orissa madhya pradesh and gujrat states during premonsoon rains but the yields are very low therefore improved agricultural techniques and better water efficiency are key to feeding a speedly increasing population rice crop is considered a water guzzler but instead of maintaining standing water irrigating the field one or two days after disappearance of ponded water from the surface can lead to water saving up to 30 percent without any significant loss in year in the context of all these situations the agricultural expert at jdm agricultural research and development foundation ladhowal distt lodhiana in the state have got success in growing paddywithout puddling they called this technique as growing paddy harvesting of rain water aulakh rp s2004 in this technique they raised nursery by the traditional method but transplanted the seedling without pudddling the field this was made possible by making rides with tractor drawn ridger afterpreparing the field the channel in between the ridges were filled with water and the paddy seedlings were planted on lower parts of level during the first weak the crop was irrigated daily but after that the irrigation was applied after a weak or more depending upon the climate special attention wasmade to irrigation at the tilling and grain filling stages dr daler singh an expert of the team conducting farmer participatory and adaptive researches at this foundation claimed that with technique water could be saved up to 70 and this technique was164helpful in saving soil fauna from drowning weeds were kept under control with recommended weedicides of 100 ml of oxyflurofin with this concept early maturity and better yield were also got in addition to water saving the concept is cost effective labour and time saving and a step towards sustainable agriculture without adversely affecting the yields what happens in case of puddling is that hard layer is created 6deep in the surface soil which dose not let water percolate down and recharge the water table but in fields of paddy grown with this technique the soil remains loose roots well aerated and the soil has plenty of earthworms helping in improving the soil health and microbial activity of the soil moreover mechanical weeding is also easieras compared to transplanted crop hence by efficient water management we can achieve the food security at lower cost and with better quality both these being the requirements of sustainable agricultural development and the changing world scenario field studies gurman singh 28 years a farmer in alampur village rajpura tehsil said bores up to 6070 ft have gone dry now bores at depth of 250 ft are being used but the water level is going down there is sand below 18 ft of ground level a nalla has been sanctioned by the government to be built in the area but it cannot be built till the syl canal is built the syl will really benefit this area becauseit will bring water to our farms this year due to lack of rain zerri paddy has not been planted in this area he also blames power supply for irrigation pumps which is only 6 hours and that too it is intermittent supply the result is no kheti in this area most of the water of sutlej is going out ofpunjab smt sukhchain kaur of the same village is worried about the rain there has been no rain for 2 years and if rain does not come for another year agriculture will be over in the area some villages in the nearby have not found water even at 500 ft it is becoming increasingly difficult to look aftercattle as due to the shortage of green fodder to the animals most of the families in the village have stopped keeping buffaloes or are keeping only one buffalo according to shri lal of janouya village all farmers have become poor men only 10 of us are still farmers there is no profit in agriculture there is no water and all bore wells at a depth of150 ft have failed now leaving farmers with no alternative except for rainfed dependance the crops of maize and gobi cauliflower have ruined due to the failure of rain the farmers of our region want syl to work at least in our region so that the water table level may rise the farmers along thebhakra canal do get water he said that each farmer in his village had 515 acres of land on an average but half of them are now blow poverty line they do not now have any capacity to take loan we do not want loan we only want the syl to come to our area smt sukhbans kaur aged 50 years of jansuya village has to tell the same story there is no chara fodder growing in the villages as there is no water so all dairy has stopped in the village165even deep water is not available i go to collect sweet water from a hand pump across the road as it is the nearest one to me that still has water i make 5 trips daily to collect only drinking water shri sham lal aged 70 years and his wife shano were grazing cattles when we meet i was doing farming till 5 years agro for the last two years my crops failed as there was no water and i am unable to raise loans to dig a deep bore for irrigation this year i have not planted any crops so asi have no work at the fag end of my life i am feeling a deep helpessness asserted shamlal near village jansuya at the flood drain tikan suban nahar shri surlalsingh and shri gurcharan singh were on their flood duty though the drain is absolutely dry they also do some cultivation in their native village they blamed the government for not providing new electricity connection as no newconnections are being given for submersible pumps there is a 10 year waiting time to get new connections so generators are being used which work on diesel which is a great additional cost to farmer with no income farmers are in heavy debt now all moneylenders have refused to lend usmoney since you have planted no crops this year how will you be able to repay the loan those farmers with big farms are getting richer but the small farmers like us are getting poorer crop diversification dominance of wheatrice crop rotation has adversely affected the agricultural economy of punjab it has unfavourably affected the ecological parameters of the state thoughfarmers try and diversify to other crops they do not find the right price and as only the wheat rice have been given a minimum support price msp which shall be declare for other crops too the punjab agro foodgrains corporation was declared the nodal agency by the state government to implement the contact farming programme with a view to encourage diversification of cropsaccording to the economic survey of punjab 200304 during rabi 2002 12238 acres was brought under the crops of hyola hybrid rapeseed mustard with higher oil content barley high malt content and wi nter maize an eara of 175 lakh acres has been brought under the land contract farmingprograme with corporate houses namely rallis india mahindra shuhlabh escorts and dcm hariyali were involved in the extension services to the contract farmers the area for contract farming may further increase to 22 lakh acres in 45 years shri sarabjot singh dhillon doing contract farming since 2 years on 30 acres in village malko in district patiala the crops he is growing are maize barely and mustard hyola 501 the scheme is not profitable for him the companies provides only seed but all other inputs are his own the price he get for my crops is lower than the price in the market for example for mustard he has given aprice of rs 1500 per quintal but the market price is rs 2000 per quintal for maize he was told that the yield would be 22 quintals per acre but he got a yield of only 1012 quintals per acre as the birds attacked the plants at the time in spite of all methods of scaring them away commentedmr dhillon according to mr dhillion the punjab agro corporation seed is more expensive than the market for example punjab agro gives the maize seed at rs 50 per kg whereas in the market it is available166at rs 30 per kg mustard hyola 501 seed is given at rs 500 per packet for an acre though at the market it is at rs 300 per packet for an acre diverse crops into the market it will encourage farmers to diversify to other crops he also wants to diversity into other crops which use less water and diesel than wheatrice combine but since the rate given to farmers in the contract is so low only 2 farmers in his district have signed the contract the contract says that the seed be bought only through punjab agrocorporation ltd but we are free to sell it to others if we are able to get a better price in the market earlier the farmers used to grow chana bengal grain but due to various reasons and better price most farmers turned to cotton but the american sundi ball worm had devastated the cotton crop leading to heavy debts said shri jaspal singh there is not even one house which is not free fromdebt about 2530 sprays had to be done on cotton when the sundi struck also the traders rule the market and decide on the price of cotton at their whim we require an msp for cotton to save ourselves we have gained nothing from agriculture except debt suffering and disease debts on farmers farmers suicides and impacts on gender and households accoding to the study done by dr shergill the total debt on the farmers in the state is rs 5700 crore this debt is 70 of the net domestic product originated in the state in a year in other words threefourths of one years total agricultural income has to be paid if the total debt is to be liquidated the districts of sangrur bhatinda and mansa which have a high share of farmers suicides also have a high debt burden in bhatinda and mansa at an average farmer has a debt of rs 90000 thesangrur district the commission agents meet 75 of the total short term credit needs of the farmers in this zonefrom suicides in punjab by institute for development and communication suicide rate an indepth analysis of disaggregate data on punjab shows disturbing trends there has been a distinct increase in the number of suicides in punjab since 1993 in 199293suicides in punjab increased by 5197 by contrast the all india average registered an increase of 511 only in subsequent years this trend has continued in 199394 there was an increase of 14 whereas in india it was 588 in 19495 the increase in the case of punjab was 57 whereas inindia as a whole here was a decline of suicides in 199597 the increase in the suicides in punjab was to the extent of 21 whereas the decline in india to the extent of 19 it is a matter of concern that the number of suicides per lakh population ie suicide rate has been steadily increasing from057 in 1988 to 206 in 1997 the suicide rate of cultivator farmers as compared with noncultivators is very high for instance suicide rate of cultivator farmers in 1993 was 198 and that of non cultivators was 090 in the year 1997 the suicide rate of cultivator farmers was 449 and noncultivators 182 suicides in rural punjab institute for development and communication the cultivator farmers suicides in the districts bordering haryana ie sangrur bhatinda and mansa was to the extent of 61 between 199197 the districts in amritsar firozepur and gurdaspur167have a 25 share of farmers suicides together these two zones have witnessed more than 85 of the total cultivators farmers suicides in the state there is a decline in the size of operational holdings in punjab about 45 of the farms are smaller than 2 hectares small size holdings have increased from 386 to 447 in 1991 the increase in the number of marginal holdings less than 1 hectare was higher at 71 this is significant because small farms are increasingly becoming uneconomical our survey was extensively done in thiscategory of farmers of small land holdings the women in this sector are crushed under burden of debt taken by their husbands sons and brothers consequently they have become psychologically distressed socially alienated and economically distressed as has been reported widely in various newspapers fragmentation of land and the consequent economic hardship has contributed to distress in families of which women have to bear the majorbrunt the former sarpanch of village sakrodi in sangrur district was under heavy debt due to crop damage and in order to pay the debt he wanted to sell some portion of his land he and his wife were in severe depression due to the debt burden the situation had become worse when 2 of his brothersseparated from him and division of land took place as the brothers refused to contribute anything towards repayment of loan he finalized the deal to sell part of the land this resulted in a severe conflict with his wife one night before the buyers were to come he killed his wife with his sword andcommitted suicide by consuming pesticide another example is of a farmer in longowal khurd village gurdaspur district who committed suicide in 1998 in 1994 due to division of land in his family only 2 acres came to his share he also had to shoulder the as well responsibility of his sisters marriage for which he had to sell 5 kanals of his land he also took loan he could not return the loan due to crop failure and his child as expelledfrom school for nonpayment of fees this depressed him so much that he killed himself the next day his wife could not face the burden of indebtness and killed herself the next day it should be noted that the decision to sell land is always a hard one in village life of punjab as it leads to status loss of the seller in the eyes of the community in bangan village villagers had been facing the problem of crop damage for 5 years caused by floods by a barrage constructed in the neighbouring area of haryana the barrage diverted the water from the river ghaggar towards bangan and other villages submerging their fields causing loss ofcrops year after year this threw the farmers of the village into a vicious debt trap and resulted in an increasing number of suicides according to the villagers they repeatedly brought the floods to the notice of the government but the govt paid no attention the fact is that the small and marginal farmers are living in economic hardship social pressure and psychological stress it is not to deny that the small and marginal farmer and even the landlesslaboureres did benefit from the trickle down effect of the green revolution but they have had to pay a very heavy social cost in a caste ridden society penetration of consumerism and its demonstration and widespread effects of dowry has further added to the woes of women in the state168the practice of dowry is making the small farmer vulnerable and adding to the problems of women at village harkishanpura in district bhatinda we spoke to shri jagraj singh sarpanch this village has come into the nnews with having the maximum number of suicides by farmers shri jagraj singh clarified that it would not be correct to say that the unhappy suicides were due to alcoholismand other such habits they were solely due to distress of being in the debt trap he gave us 7 names of the latest suicide victims they ranged from 55 to 30 years of age shri jagraj singh said chana used to be a crop in the area but due to lack of rain and lack of water there was no alternative for the farmer except to switch to cotton desi cotton was goodfor 24 years then the american sundi struck the crops and did not allow cotton to grow each farmer went into debt of one to oneandahalf lakh of rupees now the farmers have sown bt cotton this is the first experiment with it for some farmers or second time for others however the seed ofbt cotton is very expensive we need rs 2500 seed for one acre the population of the village is 10001100 with 80 homes all belonging to farmers out of these 70 homes who have taken loans have been declared defaulters so no more loan is being given to them smt nasib kaur wife of suicide victim shri bada singh said as regards my husbands fate what could i say we had 1200 kila of land in the village and he sold off 600 kila at a very low rate in order to repay part of his debt the humiliation of facing the moneylenders was too much for his pride we the farmers of this area have been cheated by the govt by moneylenders being simple andtrusting people we had expected better care from the authorities all our pleas fell ondeaf years a whole lifetime of my husbands toil was wiped out by 2 years debt one of the suicide victims in the village was a young man he married his 2 sisters and had to spend a great deal of money on the weddings this was expected of him by the inlaws of his sistersat the end he has committed suicide as debt became too heavy and he saw no hope of recovery through farming on his land we spoke to the young rmp local doctor about health problems of the villagers he said all people here are under great mental stress and tension most suffer from aches in knees and jointsand these are related to poor drinking water quality people in the village are aging 20 years earlier than the normal aging time which had existed earlier kids have started getting grey hair at the age of 7 years diarhoa is rampant and people suffer from stomachaches all the time there is no govtdispensary in the village there are no vet services in he village even cattle have deformed nails the nearest vet and dispensary are at varianwali 6 km away suggestions by women of farmers households and by farmers of panjab compensation demanded for the affected families most of which are woman headed households with small land holdings and debt to repay169 appropriate treatment and medical facilities for the serious and other diseases which have sprung crop insurance as a measure to combat the menace of suicide intervention and counselling centers that harmonise between farmers and banksmoneylenders such centers are urgently needed by the women headed households of the farming communities reorganization of social structures at panchayat level to combat the menace of consumerismand dowry msp of other crops like sugarcane and cotton to help the farmers drinking water to be supplied free of cost as the debt ridden families are unable to pay the rs 55 per month for taps also the drinking water supply should be safe the families of victims should be treated in the same way as victims of natural disasters such as earthquakes cyclones and floods public hearing in punjab a jan sunwayi to hear the impact of globalization on the graameen women of punjab was held at ludhiana on 17th march 2004 at pindi dayal dharamshalla ludhiana punjab under the banner of the national commission of women ncw national alliance of women for food and water rights nawf and diverse women for diversity with bharat jan gyan vigyan jatha and punjab stree sabhathe aim of the jan sunwayi was to hear the voices of women in agriculture on the impact of globalization on women in agriculture seed food and water it wa s envisaged that women having been traditional cultivators processors and preservers would also come forth with solutions and alternatives to theproblems apart from the graameen women from various regions of punjab with academician farmers advocates social activists medical practioners health workers veterinary doctors intellectuals and government representatives attended the meeting major sher singh auluck retd a well known farmer introduced the jury which comprised of dr vandana shiva well known environmentalist and director research foundation for science technology and ecology rfste ms amarjeet kaur all india trade union congress aituc dr arun mitra general secretary bharat jan gyan vigyan jatha ludhiana bjguj dr chanchal gupta prof ofpharmacology dayanand medical college mohinderdeep grewal a well known writer and retd lecturer shri daler singh government officer and a farmer well known for alternative farming practices whose model of paddy cultivation provides a saving of 75 water manjit kaur sodhia retd principal governmentcollege for women and activist and dr sn sewak a renowned theatre personality dr arun mitra general secretary bjguj opened the session by reminding us that centuries ago it was the women who were the first farmers who had nurtured agriculture and had ensured healthy food for the family since the men used to go out hunting it was the women who had preserved the water bodies forest biodiversity and had ensured clean drinking water for all170dr mitra dwelt on the policies of world trade organization wto the globalization under wto is affecting the agriculture sector particularly women said dr mitra he added as and when patent act under wto is implemented it will increase the cost of medicines beyond the common man now the traditional healing systems have got replaced by expensive medicines which are gettingcostlier day by day for example a simple drug for stomach disorders costs rs 2 in india but costs rs 30 in pakistan similar scenario will emerge in india dr mitra added that farmers are suffering loss in agriculture due to policies being imposed on them which are not farmerfriendly distribution system pds which was a way to provide food at acontrolled price have been closed down causing great hardship to the poor as he now has to buy the basic food at higher costs the common man is also being forced to even buy water to drink he called on all the participants and the eminent members present to jointly study the problems and as well asevolve an action plan ms amarjeet kaur from aituc reminded the audience of the important role that women had played in our country since the earlier times most herbs have been named after women most rivers have been named after women ie ganga jamuna and saraswati even search of water and hadbeen done by women the relationship between women and soil seed water biodiversity has been and is very deep therefore the theft of our seeds and biodiversity which has been nurtured and preserved by the women has had a deep impact on them dr vandana shiva director rfste recalled that when she had visited punjab in the early 80s the term punjab shining was being used widely to acclaim the prosperity due to the green revolution but she had seen even at that time that beneath the shine of punjab were monocultures of water intensive crops the chemicals that go along with and ruin the fertile soil so after proclaiming thatpunjab was shining by spoiling the fertility of its soil and depletion of ground water we are now proclaiming india shining dr shiva added that this term is being used at a time when multi national corporation mnc like monsanto has been allowed to patent a variety of our wheat rfste through a writ petition filedbefore the supreme court of india had filed a case against the patenting of a variety of our basmati and had been successful in making the us patent and t rademark office uspto to revoke all but 3 of the 20 claims of patency for basmati rice lines and grains which it had granted to an americanmnc rice tec inc also rfste along with other groups had demanded withdrawal of the patent on neem that had been granted to an mnc wr grace by the european patent office again now with greenpeace and other organizations rfste has challenged monsanto in a court at munich germany for patenting our wheat but the question is this why should we as citizens of india have to challenge an mnc for stealing our wheat when it is actually the duty of the government to do so and protect our wheat but the government as if it is silently allowing mncs to steal our wheat even the sacred river ganga171and its waters is being sold to an mnc suez so perhaps we should coin new terms ie coke shining and monsanto shining since these companies will make enormous profits on our food and water which are our fundamental rights and by stealing our biodiversity which has been preserved by our women through centuries she added dr shiva reminded the audience that sikh gurus had fought for welfare of the whole humanity of the country punjab has traditionally been the state that has borne the brunt of invasions and invasive policies and has always provided protection to the rest of india it was at punjab that that the first voice against rin loan was raised which then led to the formulation of the land alienationact 1900 which clearly stated that no one can take away a farmers land cattle and house and that they belonged to him and him alone the legendary hard work of punjabs farmers became the reason for punjab to take a pioneering role when indias green revolution started punjabs farmers worked hard experimented with newseeds and invested in fertilisers and pesticides punjab prospered and developed into the wheat bowl of india but in the process a new story began to unfold in districts like bhatinda the water table has collapsed water bodies are poisoned with chemicals the land has been degraded with excess pesticides and yields are falling though bhatinda was notthe best place to farm initially being rocky and barren farmers worked hard and ploughed the rocky land dump topsoil and infuse it with fertilisers the barren land sprang to life and gave bountiful wheat crops but some years ago a large number of farmers in bhatinda moved out of growing wheatand shift to cotton as it was a cash crop with rich dividends the first few years of the cotton crop were good till the american bollworm attack came crops got destroyed panic stricken the farmers through pesticide dealers started pumping in huge amounts of pesticides initially the pests died butthen the pests developed immunity fast says lal singh a cotton farmer in bhatinda before 1990 we had no problems we used to earn well and so eat well and lived well but after the pests came we saw hell we had to spray throughout the year and sometimes as many as 35 times as thepesticide was very expensive we had to take loans in villages where pesticide use is high health concerns are rising water in bhatinda district is no longer fit for drinking due to toxity of water the water in harkishanpura has been certified unfit for drinking by the government but everyone continues to drink it as there is no alternative the waterwas found to have high concentrates of chloride excessive use of pesticides has destroyed the topsoil in many areas and has crept into the water table endangering the health of villagers crops failed year after year and debts increased honor is a sacred word in punjab as moneylenders came knocking doors the proud farmers of punjab could not hide their shame and hundreds committedsuicide in village harkishanpura the village sarpanch passed a resolution and announced that the village of about 125 families and spread over 1170 acres was up for sale the reason was that not a single house in this prosperous area was free of debt many have sold their land to be free of debt172it is a collapse of a dream says sukhminder singh a cotton farmer and member village panchayat at harkishanpura we will end up as agricultural labourers our children have moved out to nearby areas as casual labourers earning about rs 70 a day she added farmers and labor working on farms claim they are being affected by use of pesticides burning of eyes skin rashes and itching giddiness and fainting have been reported by labor after they have sprayed in fields many families use the gunny bags and the attractive plastic containers of pesticidesto store foodstuffs ie wheat flour once the spray is over buckets used for mixing pesticides are used to store drinking water consumption of pesticide residues through food and water weaken the immune system and opens up the human body to various diseases ms usha sharma an advocate in punjab and haryana high court also discussed the water pollution due to pesticide recently there have been several deaths from village jajjal and neighbouringvillages a large number of people are suffering from cancer kidney failure and ulcers she demanded that compensation must be given to those who died due to pollution quoting villagers she said that water has been proven to be the killer in the village forcing the villagers to go to talwandi sabo about5 km from the village to fetch clean water panchayat of jajjal village has been writing to the government to conduct an inquiry and has put aside land for a water treatment plant along with 1 lakh of rupees the government has taken no action and only turned a deaf ear to the pleas t aking suo motu notice of the news item in hindustan times march 18 2004 that polluted drinking water in jajjal village of bathinda district was causing serious cancerlike disease thepunjab and haryana high court has issued notice to the state of punjab through the secretary public health department secretary department of rural development and panchayats bathinda deputy commissioner and gram panchayat of the village we think that the constitutional safeguards provided in the constitution prima facie stand breached by the state of punjab and its functionaries in relation to the residents of jajjal village andaccordingly issue notice remarked hon able high court smt darshan kaur from fatehgarh sahib said that in a few years the water level in her village had gone down from 70 metres to 150 metres this is causing great difficulty for the people parveen kaur from amritsar talked about the problem of drinking water in her village handpump water is below 250 ft poor like her cannot afford the kind of money rs 6000 to buy a pump she added without water in the morning hours women cannot send their children to school smt kamla spoke about the water problem for a tanker the contractor charges rs 400 which the poor cannot pay sometimes in her area sewage gets mixed with the water supply she blamed the government for the pathetic condition of the farmers and the poor we are forced to sign on rs2500 while we are getting only rs 1200 or bawa singh from voluntary health association of india vhai punjab chapter said that since the last 40 years there has been a drastic change in the lifestyles of people in punjab the173government and mncs selected special pockets in punjab where labour was cheap in order to get more food grain even though water in those areas was less the companies also made profit from the farmers by selling them pesticides and fertilizers farmers were assured that they would have very good output and a very rosy picture was painted farmers were not able to calculate what their incomewould be they built homes and bought goods but they did not do this from their own bank balance but from bank loan another point that is to be noted that even though the interest on a for with a bank is only 8 the farmer had to pay 18 interest on loans taken from bank and between 2440on loans taken from private money lenders t oday majority of the farmers are indebted and committing suicides to reduce the farmers suicides the bank rate must be reduced to the rate of fixed deposit moneylenders should not be allowed to charge more than the bank rate government should have the facility to purchase theagricultural produce of the farmers which it promotes among them for instance government promoted keenu in punjab but there is no industry to purchase or consume keenu in the state mr nirpender singh from fazlika said in big canals the government has laid polythene to stop the water seepage into the earth which is lowering the water table in punjab as the water table isgoing down and down women are forced to travel long distances to collect water earlier the water used to be sweet but now it is bitter in taste it is our rainwater that the government is giving through the canal to another country pakistan but the government does not hesitate to deprive the farmersof punjab of the water by lining it the with polythene mr nirpender singh talked about the minimum support price msp for sugarcane this was earlier fixed at rs 100 per quintal but the farmers are getting rs 70per quintal the balance rs 30 was the profit the loss of which is badly affecting farmers as a loss of this saving the farmer likehim was compelled to take loan even though he was willing to put the papers of his land in the custody of the bank for a very small amount of rs 3 lakh yet he was refused the loan yet his brother who has a cloth shop was sanctioned rs 6 lakh shri manmohan sharma from vhai punjab chapter said women suffered most from chemical farming as they worked on farms and so are the first ones to come in direct contact with chemicals causing it disorders of endocrine glands cancer asthma skin diseases and infertility studies reveal that breast milk samples from punjab contain pesticide even pesticide dealers in spite of theirimmediate gains regret that excess of pesticide has damaged the soil of punjab shri manmohan sharma also talked about the contract farming in punjab sangrur has become the first district to introduce contract farming according to mr sharma the contract has no legal binding for the company exploits the farmers the farmers are unaware of what is written in the lengthy documents and usually sign without being clearly told of the terms the buy back cost of the produce by the company is never mentioned in the contract174ms rajinder singh brar a woman farmer who belongs to abohar fazilka mentioned that no male acknowledges the existence of female farmer she is doing agriculture better than men farmers she has decided to change to organic farming she said that women farmers have not received any training in water management by extension workers organic wheat grown by her received a muchlower price than the other wheat she explained how the contract farming is cheating the farmers due to absence of proper contracts between them and the companies that have been mandated to carry out contract farming in the state a particular produce that fetched rs 850 per kg in the market was paid only rs 35per kg for the castor the price is rs 1650 per kg but the company paid only rs 1000 per kg while the cost of production is fixed by the manufacturer but in the case of agriculture the farmers do not fix it she also talked about the water scarcity in her region moreover the water is alkaline being a rich farmer i can afford to pay the cost of 3 tankers per week but poor farmers cannot afford it these poor women are busy throughout the day on collecting water she also added government should start agroprocessing she demanded she blamed the male dominated society for the problems of women engaged in agriculture males have differentattitude towards women engaged in agriculture it is difficult for males to digest the success of female farmers she gave the example of how the scientist in punjab agricultural university pau ludhiana did not cooperatewith her when she went to find out about the new varieties according to dr rajinder pal singh auluck agricultural scientist women are a part of every gathering in punjab but the men never tried to improve their condition he said the growing alternative crop replacing wheat or paddy is not the solution paddy and wheat are not the culprits but the technique being used is the culprit a feedback shows that the contract farming is veryharmful to the farmer when we give the negative feedback about the bt cotton in punjab the indian representatives of monsanto appear to be more worried and anxious than the foreign employee of the company dr singh stressed that women should take active part in decisionmaking he gave the example that when the wife is the sarpanch it is only her husband who takes all the decision women sarpanch should become more active and take the decision for her ms gurbax kaur head teacher of a school in jalandhar said women should not use fruit produced by chemicals she also requested the audience not to use the tullu pump as it blockswater and deprives others shri darshan singh macchiwala discussed about the integrated and holistic approach in farming adopted by him on his farm though he has passed only 7th standard but he has achieved remarkable success in making the best use of recycling techniques besides cultivation he has a piggery a poultry175farm and fishing ponds the wastes of one are being recycled as manure for the other his technique of organic farming has been widely acclaimed and he has helped others to replicate his model the successful alternative model as has been developed by shri darshan singh macchiwala has been acknowledged in punjab as a best practice in agriculture dr chanchal gupta professor of pharmacology at deen dayal medical college had observed a steep rise in diseases which are very likely linked to intake of unsafe foods which contain residues of chemicals she also said that plastics should not be used as it blocks the flow of water in pipes drains and canals and since plastics are nonbiodegradable they affect the productivity of the soil shri avtar singh said agricultural scientists have encouraged farmers to use pesticides whom is causing water pollution smt sukhwinder kaur saini from district ropar said she and her neighbour farmers were sold outside seeds and promised higher and better quality produce however the produce was of low quality and could not be marketed it was a trick by agents to sell seeds to innocent farmers withoutany guarantee of quality so that farmers are forced to buy seeds for the next crop women should make it a point to save their own seed as they had been doing for years dr sn sewak who was a jury member said we are shining only in corruption we should follow some policies to avoid desertification of punjab women are not coming forward to take thelead when a woman becomes sarpanch only the husband takes decisions he said that the government was ready to give rs 15 lakh grant for open air theatre but the woman sarpanch could not even decide whether she could take the grant or not and depended on her husband even for such a simpledecision according to the alma ata declaration health care was to be provided to all by the year 2000 national health policy had guaranteed that by the year 2000 health would be a fundamental right which may not be possible studies to become a doctor have become very high it costs upto rs 50lakhs for medical studies including post graduation in some private colleges yet private medical colleges are being promoted and the government medical colleges are getting neglected and closing down said mr arun mitra dr vandana shiva closed the session by reminding the farmers that the new international policy has very little space for the farmers and no place at all for the small farmers in fact in usa the government says that only 2 of population need be farmers the question then is where will rest of the farmers go there is a big plan to finish off our small farmers and allow only a few big farmersto exist which will be controlled by mncs in fact an exit clause of farmers is written in the text of wtg but in india small farmers have been and are the very basis of our agriculture the government should form policies that protect and encourage the farmers17724 bundelkhand occupying almost 70000 square kilometers of the central plains in india the bundelkhand stretches over twelve districts of northern madhya pradesh mp and five districts of southern uttarpradesh up located between the generally hot and humid dry continental climate of the west rajasthan the bundelkhand generally experiences a semiarid climate though this is highly variable depending on the time of year indeed the area is known for experiencing droughts in summer and disastrous floodsduring the monsoon on average the region receives anywhere form 75 cm to 125 cm of rain each year the dry plains in the north usually receive less while the southeast benefits from more water daily temperatures also fluctuate depending on the time of the year peak summer mayjune brings excessively hightemperatures often topping 40c as the hot dry loo winds sweep in from the desert during the winter months december february daytime temperatures are quite pleasant reaching highs between 165 c and 21c nighttime brings much cooler temperatures and frost has been known to occur on thecoldest evenings the bundelkhand is drained by the yamuna river system itself one of the principal tributaries of the ganges due to this drainage occurs principally from north to south with some local variation depending on topography the main tributaries of the yamuna are the betwa ken baghain pahuj anddhasan rivers most of which are important sources of irrigation water however even more important than rivers are the numerous small streams and nallahs that feed the larger rivers both manmade and natural water bodies dot the countryside of bundelkhand these vary from lakes and reservoirs to tanks and other water harvesting structures and play an important role inassuring water security in the region the most well known are pahuj reservoir barwar sagar barwar lake siaori lake pachawara lake dakwan and parichha reservoirs arthar tal manikput tal majhgawan tal bela tal and rajpura sagar among others grasses are predominant in the rocky plains and hills particularly after the monsoon although scrub and brush species are also common where more water is available for their growth siari katai gunj bel and ghout trees provide some shelter in the normally open wastelands which characterize the bundelkhand region these grasses and shrub species are important as fodder for cattle and haveeconomic value178black soils which are found mostly in the south of the region are more water retentive and are therefore preferred for wheat gram and sugarcane cultivation covering only a small percentage of the bundelkhand riverine soils are primarily formed by sand and clays these soils are generally not used for agriculture and are therefore not considered as an important soil in the region the impact of human activity on the region has until now been unsustainable even now the bundelkhand is seen as a region suffering from acute ecological degradation logging and mining activities over the past several centuries have denuded the landscape and facilitated the erosion of the fragile soils additional population and livestock pressures which are already high have only servedto aggravate the problem expanding ravine lands especially in the northern area are already threatening local farmland and can have serious consequences on the socioeconomic situation access to abundant water resources has always been one of the major environmental concerns in the region irregular rainfall has often led to either drought or flood conditions with consequenteffects on the natural and human environment increasing dependence on groundwater resources has led to a lowering of the groundwater table in places where withdrawals have exceeded recharge the decline in groundwater levels has further undermined water security in the region and accelerateddesertification and erosion in recent years water quality has also emerged as a principal environmental concern erosion from marginal lands and agricultural fields has increased the sediment load in the rivers and has already shortened the lifespan of many checkdams and water harvesting structures thegrowing use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers which until now has remained quite low will also affect water quality in the future the people of the bundelkhand have remained both politically and economically separated from the rest of india as such the area has one of the lowest levels of economic and human developmentin the country indeed the remoteness of the region has prevented the development of basic infrastructure such as roads electricity water and sanitation services and telephone lines the lack of these services has only perpetuated the poverty cycle in the region according to current estimates the human population of the bundelkhand region is approximately 21 million the present population is four times greater than in 1961 which indicates that the population growth rate has remained high since the green revolution improved cropping practices and ensured greater food security in fact historical data on population growth in the region shows thatpopulation size over the past century has fluctuated widely due to the climate floods and drought immigration from pakistan and urban migration and epidemics of cholera and influenza bundelkhand is an agricultureintensive region and therefore the majority of the populations are rural and dispersed over the area nonetheless increasing population pressures will force a greaternumber to settle on marginal lands which have previously remained abandoned in addition more and more rural inhabitants are leaving their villages and migrating to the larger urban centers such as jhansi hamirpur and banda recent rural migration data indicates a rate as high as 39 per year179public hearing held in bundelkhand 180which is over three and a half times the national average of 11 male rural outmigration is quite common but nonetheless disruptive to the family social unit the majority work as farmers or agricultural labourers occasionally supplementing their incomes during the nonplanting season working as day labourers or in small cottage industries the regional economy is almost exclusively based on agriculture owing to the predominantly rural population andlack of exploitable natural resources industry is mostly absent save in the larger towns and cities such as jhansi statistics show that the ratio of working factories to 100000 people is 16 in the bundelkhand versus 63 in the rest of central india most of the nonagricultural economy is based on smallcommercial ventures or the provision of basic services agriculture plays an important role in the bundelkhand economy however even this sector has not been exploited to its full potential due to several factors poor soils and uncertain rainfall have made agriculture difficult in many areas crop productivity is among the lowest in the country andeven the value of agricultural production per hectare in the region is 14 times less than for central india frequent droughts and floods have destroyed crops and undermined social security as well and few farmers irrigate their lands perpetuating the cycle has been the poverty that has prevented manyfarmers from switching to more efficient farming methods as such most of the agriculture is subsistence and contributes little to the overall economy in the region nonetheless the principle crops in the bundelkhand are cereals such as wheat rice and barley cereals occupy the majority of the cropped area and are sown primarily during the rabi winterdryseason in addition pulses grams and oil seeds are also important crops fruits vegetables and fibres are only secondary in importance and are localised to specific geographic areas mixed cropping is still practised by farmers as a precautionary measure against crop failure but the method is encounteredless and less particularly where there is access to irrigation the majority of the irrigated land receives water from later construction works such as the canals built during the british raj or the postindependence matatila lalitpur and sarpar dams these structures have done much to increase the irrigation potential of the region but still only benefit athird of the cultivable area while the use of irrigation has improved the lot of many farmers in the region the widespread use of groundwater has severely affectd the sustainability of this activity in a region that often suffers from weak monsoons and drought recharge of the groundwater table islimited over extraction bas already led to a decrease in the water table and if continued will pose a serious threat to water security in the region public hearing in bundelkhand the jan sunwayi was organised by rfste manviya shiksha sanstha an organisation working for farmers rights in bundelkhand and national commission for women both women and men of theregion bundelkhand gathered in large numbers at sri vatika garden at village barokharkhurd people came from different areas viz chhattrerpur district mahoba lalitpur srinagar milathu gaon about181victims of rape at bundelkhand jan sunwaiye 182750 participants attended the jan sunwayi prominent among the women who spoke were smt shobana srivastava a prominent woman farmer smt udheria devi pradhan karbi zila panchayat smt ram dulari chairperson mahoba zila panchayat smt sonia pradhan khaptia village banda distt and smt ram devi member panchayat chandwara gaon banda distt up the jury consisted of shri radha ram bundela the famous historian of the region dr lakshmi t ripathi professor mahila maha vidyalaya smt saraswati director mahila jagrati manch karbi sudha chauhan ex chairperson banda nagar palika dr bhartendu and smt shobana shrivastava well known farmers of the region rakesh aggarwal correspondent etv shri chanda mohan sahua well known farmer and vandana shiva director rfste maya jani director navdanya and hiti mahindroo from diverse women for diversity lack of water has made it difficult for women the women complained of lack of water in their households for example kunna devi from barokher village said there was no water in taps sheiladevi from bidhipur gaon talked about the poor sanitation system in her village during rains the sanitation water flowed into the houses shashi singh from zila mahila manch banda said water supply is only for 15 min to 30 min in a day since there is no electricity so generators do not workshe said that the ken betwa river link which is being planned by the government to take the water from ken away will trouble the region even further since the region is already water scarce smt laxmi tripathi said in bundelkhand women have no work except to collect drinking water on their heads from long distance the grim situation of water may best be illustrated by saying inbundelkhand which is roughly translated as let the husband die but the earthen pot of water should not break instead of solving the water problem the attempts of the government to link ken to betwa is a disastrous mistake banda is entirely dependant on ken river if ken is linked to betwa it will notonly affect banda but would also jeopardise the survival of farmers who depend on the ken the participants were extremely apprehensive of the drought like conditions that would prevail in the aftermath of the kenbetwa river link and the desertification of the region as a consequence the farmers of the ken region would be directly affected with drying up of wells and lowering of thewater table said ms laxmi t ripathi she added about 400 villages in banda district will also be affected because there will be no water in the river during summer said smt suman water is the biggest problem in almost every district of bundelkhand whether it is banda or lalitpur despite the large number of dams in bundelkhand the queue for water beforea tap or a hand pump is a common sight during summer bundelkhand has sufficient rainfall but people have forgotten the conventional system of water conservation causing a water crisis for instance the old tanks in the tikamgarh district are still operational and provide water to the people according to smt suman the scenario is worst in patha in chitrakoot district where women have to travel a long distance to collect water for drinking half of womens time is spent to travel long distances to collect water which affects their health and wellbeing of their children and aggravates183domestic problems it has to be noted that the patha drinking water scheme was completed in 1973 which has however failed to solve the problem because 30 to 60 water does not reach the people in a village near patha there is only one hand pump which is in use in village sakroha only 3 out of 13 hand pumps are in use causing great distress to people even today in bundelkhand women play an equal role in agriculture agriculture is not considered a commercial activity here the women want to do farming of traditional crops like their traditional wheat rice and pulses but they are unable to find a market of their fine rice varieties and the policy of the state does not allow rices of the region like kanda and katka to go to other states which isnot a favourable policy for women the rice variety mushkin of the region is one of the finest varieties yet state does not allow the variety to be exported to other states as the market for this rice is not enough within the region so this variety is in danger of getting lost these traditional finerice varieties are not bought by the state and neither are they allowed to sell them in other states these way farmers would tend to stop growing the traditional varieties which would then get lost they discussed difficulties with other traditional crops also smt shashi singh said that today agriculture in bundelkhand is facing a crisis as the government is promoting genetically modified gm crops which have increased by about 40 during 19962001 gm crops need more water and more fertilisers which may affect food soil and water as some soils in bundelkhand have micronutrient deficiency she was worried about the adverse affects of use ofchemicals and gm crops in the region shri ramdeo namdeo said that the areas consisting of black soil away from the lakes have less water these having natural kheti bundelkhand was famous for its pulses like moong urad kondo sarna and chana however these pulses varieties are slowly finishing as the seeds of these varietiesare not available now the new wheat varieties are beginning to replace the traditional biodiverse crops the region between jhansi and tikamgarh which includes barua sagar and prithvipur is a region well known for its fresh vegetables especially haldi ginger arbi and lauki among otherswomen are the main farmers in this region women partake in all farming related activities including carrying vegetables to market and selling the produce women said these vegetables should be protected they also said as the region should be protected from outside influences such as chemicalfarming which would spoil the biodiverse nature of farming in the region the farmers are against chemical farming they described how the soils of those farmers who had used chemical fertilizers and pesticides have become dependent on chemicals and how the soil now needs increasing amount of chemicals which is proving to be very expensive for them most ofthem have got into debt others complained that the farmers who do very hard toil are left with no profit whereas the traders who buy from them are making 100 fold profit they demanded that policies should be made farmer friendly from the very first step of receiving reliable healthy seed bank184loans at a low rate of interest more and more farmers are turning towards organic farming during the jan sunwayi farmers shared with each other their experiences in chemical and organic farming

from the traditional grasses and bamboo as they do not find market for them they do not find market for soap and herbal concoctor ether and paper either so they have stopped these activities also on the whole women have lost their incomes and livelihoodsin the agroprocessing sector but they want the revival of the agroprocessing sector in the region as well as market for their produce dr sahib singh shukla from atara said in his region oap and urea was distributed free of cost which is overtaking traditional farming but farmers should strive to save the soil by using gobar khadsugarcane mills are closed dr shukla said he would like to set up a kacchi dhani which could cater to 610 households if other people also set up such dhanis villagers could generate income for themselves smt shobana shrivastava a successful woman farmer encouraged women to carry on with their work she narrated some success stories of her village where women graze cattle and sell milk she said help yourselves and do not cry common land belonging to villages used for pastures for the cattle has been given away as patta to various people so the villagers have nowhere to graze their cattle recovery of commonsis a dire need in the region so that women can again go back to rearing of livestock shri ramdeo186namdeo said that loss of commons and pastureland has resulted that no cattle to be kept at homes therefore households do not have milk and children are being deprived of a valuable food it is not profitable any more to keep cattle veterinary care for the cattle in case needed is not available till a few years ago it was possible to see about 500 cattle in each village but now one can see onlyabout 10 cattle shri ramdeo namdeo from niwari of tikamgarh narrated there are 1200 lakes and ponds in tikamgarh district and most have been built by rajas as manta as promised for fulfillment of wish for benefit of people they have been built by locals using conventional techniques and functioned tilltoday they do not need much maintenance there are thousands of baories in bundelkhand earlier they were looked after by communities but today most of them have gone into private hands in areas which are not in private ownership panchayats look after the maintenance of the baories it isimportant to educate the panchayats particularly women about the need to maintain the baories in many lakes such as bisagarh nandanwara lake sindur sagar gwalsagar and others women farmers have been growing kesru surka kama i dandi and mumr in the lakes in the summer months and singham in winter months till recently the lakes provided livelihood to women fishers fish fromthese lakes is today even being sent to west bengal but now fishing rights are given to big contractors women from communities that depended on fishing as a livelihood are without work avdesh related how fishermen of the region had lost their livelihoods due to government policy of giving fishing contracts to big contractors her fishermanhusband has now to do rickshaw pulling to earn a livelihood kamal from bharti samaj sangh said that for all the years villagers had harmoniously fished in lakes by rotation of days the lakes were a common resource for the benefit of the community the rainwater fed the lakes and the villagerslooked after the lakes for the benefit of all but now the government auctions

demanded that all liquor shops be closed the women also said that since credit cards had been introduced in187the area their lives had become very hard the combination of easily available liquor and credit cards had aggravated the problem shri avdesh said in fact only smallholdings exist in bundelkhand and these are of no use 31 departments that had to be transferred to the panchayats have not been done so once this is done local governance will become stronger and will benefit the local communities he is very worried asto the consequence if the kenbetwa river linking he said the river link will cause ken to dry up and then what will happen to the women the women shouted in unison we will go dry but hamirpur zila will flow away with floodwaters dr bhartendu a successful farmer of the

agroprocessing at home dr bhartendu was equally worried about the consequences of the ken betwa river link we would not allow ken to be turned away fromus all of us should sit together and make a yojna and form a sangathan to protect our agriculture for our families at the end of of jansunwai shri kamal from barokherkhurd block summarize the hearing 1 save the people from rin loans the bank interest on loans for farmers is too high and creates misery for the farmers in case of death of a farmer who has taken loan the widow be exemptedfrom repayment of loan taken by the late husband 2 ken betwa river link should not be allowed to make as it will rob farmers of their livelihoods as well as create water scarcity in the region 3 the traditional lakes tanks and ponds in bundelkhand which are still functioning should be maintained properly by the community and by the government as these are a source of waterfood and livelihoods to a large number of people since these lakes tanks and ponds are rainfed best practices should be replicated in water scarce areas if possible 4 there should be a separate law for women in the farming sector5 chemical farming should not be encouraged traditional farming and traditional crops of the area should be protected as well as promoted 6 agroprocessing in the region should be revived as it is a good source of income for women market should be made for agroproducts of the region 7 t raders are grabbing common pasturelands this should be stopped panchayats should try and recover common pasturelands attempts should be made to green the region once again 8 fishing rights should be restored to locals and not auctioned to contractors9 access to food is fundamental right so all people should get food18810 all liquor vends should be closed down credit cards should not be distributed the introduction of credit cards and opening of liquor vends is a lethal combination 11 violence against women is growing at an alarming rate even though there have been dowry related deaths there are no women police officers and legal aid cells in the region women have great difficulty to register firs as police personnel are uncooperative more womens cellsshould be opened at police stations that women police officers be present at all times and that legal aid cells be opened as well as be operational in the region18931 recommendations on the basis of the research study undertaken on the impact of wto on women in agriculture diverse women for diversity has the following recommendations for the national commission onwomen and the government of india t owards a women centred agriculture policy a t rade and technology policies must protect the livelihoods of women in agriculture the agreement on agriculture of the wto aoa must be reviewed with a gender perspective b since it is womens collective knowledge and expertise embodied in seeds and biodiversity there should be no patents or ipr monopolies on seed the trips agreement of wto must bereviewed from a gender perspective c womens work in agro processing is both an important source of livelihoods and important source of safe and culturally diverse foods food safety laws designed to destroy household and community based agro processing need to be changed the sanitary and phyto sanitary agreementof wto 50s must be reviewed with womens livelihoods and expertise of agro processing in focus d agriculture and trade policy needs to be guided by the objectives of sustainability livelihood and income security and food security these objectives also serve the interests of women e organic farming needs to be promoted to increase womens productive roles in agriculture decrease health hazards from toxic chemicals and avoid the drain of scarce family incomes to pay for unnecessary chemicals f livelihood and income security creates the imperative to protect agriculture from dumping of artificially cheap subsidized products these needs reintroduction of qrs quantitative restrictionsthe right to countries to protect special products and introduce special safeguard measures must be used to protect the livelihoods and incomes of women in agriculture g for a women centred food security model we proposed the following a truly woman centred decentralized democratic model of food procurement and distribution for food security has to ensure food security at the household level190 food security at the local level food security at the regional level food security at the national level the present food crisis is reflected in bursting godowns and starving people a reflection of total food insecurity at the household local and regional levels a truly decentralized democratic model will put the foundation of national food security

of genuine decentralization of the food system for gram sabhas to be empowered to function as providers of food security they need to 191 establish community grain banks gram annakosh receive grants

culturally appropriate foods use locally procured grain for all public food related programmes and schemes like icds food for work schemes anna anthodia jawaharlal rodger yojana and other development programmes school midday meals as well as in all other public sector institutions such as primary healthcenters district health centers canteens railways etc in case surpluses exist after meeting

develop over 5 years a multilayered pds system with responsibilities at each level matches with rights and capacities at that level centre continues to fix a uniform minimum support price for food grains and ensures itsimplementation both for public and private procurement so that internal dumping of food grain does not occur and farmers get a fair price revision of new agricultural policy to make it farmercentered and food security centered rather than corporationcentered by removing a contract farmingb incentives such as tax holidays tax concessions low lending rate etc to corporations for taking over food system c ban futures trading in food grains policy should give priority to local production local procurement and local processing removal of farmto port clauses in exim policy and zero excise duty for industrial agro processing194 exports to be routed through state agencies after ensuring the existence of genuine surpluses after ensuring domestic food security at the levels of the household the village the region and the nation have been met imports only to be in periods of genuine scarcity remove restrictions on transport of food within the country by farmers rather than traders new taxes on luxury consumption corporations increase in tariffs on agricultural imports and exports to finance national food security system including financial resoures to be transferredto state and gram sabhas maintain national buffer stocks bring back quantitative restriction on imports and exports of agricultural commodities and food by using art 20 and 21 of the wto agreement on agriculture negotiate for change in wtos agreement on agriculture to ensure that livelihood and food security boxes empower india to be exempted from trade liberalization rules of wto in areasof food and agriculture fix minimum retail price for essential commodities ensure labeling for food safety including freedom from genetic engineering wto reforms for a genuinely decentralized food system the present rule of the wto including its various treaties such as the aoa trips and gats undermine the constitution of the country by threatening the fundamental right to food the panchayati raj amendment and the federal structure of the constitution the renegotiated terms part of the citizens call for wto sink to shrink the renegotiation should include as part of creating a genuinely decentralized agenda for food security system agreement on agriculture the negotiations must reject the clauses on market access removal of quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and removal of subsidies to farmers and foodsubsidies for consumers quantitative restrictions must be reimposed on food and agricultural items t rade related intellectual property rights trips food security is not possible without farmers right to safe seed monopoly iprs on seeds plants and other life forms threaten farmers rightto safe seed and thus endanger food security sanitary and phytosanitary agreement the current dominant interpretation of the agreement allows the shutting up on safe foods on sps grunds such as banning freshly pressed lowcost healthy mustard oil while allowing the introduction of hazardous foods such as genetically195engineered food products meat products that increase health hazards and public health problems each nation needs to develop its own national system that meets its national needs of safety rather than being limiteddirected by the present interpretation of the sps general agreement on trade in service gats covers food distribution and water by ringing both sectors under services thus it allows corporate takeover of essental commodities and vitalresources without which it is not possible to survive food and water cannot be brought under gats recommendations from jan sunwais it is strongly recommended that for social economic and political empowerment of rural women in india the development managers must design their development programmers and activities byconsidering not only men as farmers and women as farmers wives but as equal partners in development process policies should spell out specific legislation and programmes of action to entitle women to productive assets access to inputs land credit water fertilizer seeds information technology andtraining etc access to markets and womens full membership in organizations efforts to formulate sustainable development policies should recognize the impact of unsustainable practices on women especially in relation to food security and marginal groups women households headed by women intrahousehold food allocation should be investigated and addressed if necessary agricultural policies and technology must seek to eliminate drudgery to improve economic efficiency and wages for the time spent by women and to militate against the displacement of female labour measures to increase productivity must be accompanied by policies to ensure commensurate increase in incomes wages and other benefits for women the families of suicide victims should be treated in the same way as victims of natural disasterssuch as earthquake there must be a policy of crop insurance to mitigate the hardship due to crop failure guidance centre must be started to harmonize the functioning between banksmoneylenders and the women farmers women should be increasingly involved in the decision making process in agriculture even when the wife is sarpanch it is only her husband who takes all the decisions farmers particularly women farmers must be given loan at the nominal interest rate public distribution system must be strengthened196 the indiscriminate use of pesticides should be stopped to avoid the health hazards like burning of eyes skin rashes itching giddiness t o help the faarmers minimu support price shuld be fixed for cash crops and plantation sector as large number of women are involved t o enhance the income of women engaged in agriculture government should revive the agro processing sector as women have always been on the fore print to save the seeds they should raise against thebiopiracy and mncs emphasis must be given on water harvesting and the seed varieties consuming less water awareness should be created among women involved in agriculture about the impact of globalization disparity in wages based on sex must be stopped1974 references kulkarni viswanath 2003 coffee growers holding back produce the business line may 29 2003 new delhi boriah g 2002 t ea india worlds largest consumer the hindu survey of indian

strengthen the public distribution system pds we demand on expanded system which will include many more essential commodities we demand that ration cards be given without hindrance to all those who require them food grains at half the priceof ration supplies must be supplied priority in the distribution of cheap food grains and other essential commodities women should be given a special role in the running of these pds network and the community should be encouraged to play a bigger role this is essential tomake a system more accountable and to prevent pilferage and black marketing a multitried system needs to be established consisting of national grain banks in which the government must play a stronger role all the way to the micro level where community run and women run grainbanks become the basis for household food security and a community level public distribution system 5 we demand proper land use policy guidelines to prevent diversion of agricultural land for commercial purposes including aquaculture and horticulture common land and panchayat land is beinghanded over to commercial interests depriving the village poor of their use we demand this practice be stopped and that the genuine implementation of land reforms and an immediate halt to the removal of land ceiling laws and a stop to foreign direct investment fdi in agriculturethe removal of land ceilings and the opening of fdi in agriculture is increasing the numbers of landless and increasing the burden of the landless2046 declining public investment and encouragement of the corporate sector in agriculture leaves the farmers vulnerable to rural capitalists and multinational corporations mncs we call upon the government to encourage public investment and restrict mnc investment in agriculture 7 we women cal on the world bank to stop the deliberate creation of hunger and malnutrition in india through structural adjustment policies especially those forced on agriculture 8 we demand safe and healthy food for all we demand the government ensures that our food is free from chemical and nonchemical adulteration effective food safety provisions need to be in place to prevent adulteration thereby enabling the public access to safe and healthy foods of our choice 9 we out rightly reject genetically engineered foods genetically engineered foods are proving to cause retarded growth and immune deficiencies since women and children are the worst victims of malnutrition health hazards due to the consumption of genetically engineered foods will be most severely felt by poor women and children 10 we call upon the government to immediately stop the license for free importation of 1 million tonnes of soyabean for our edible oil industry which is not necessary from a point of view of peoples food rights and will pose threat to livelihoods of farmers a large section of whom are women it will also post a threat to women and childrens health since the government has failedto take actions to ban the importation to genetically engineered soya or demand the separation and labelling of all genetically engineered foods 11 we demand a halt to the use of imported food and unsafe food for welfare schemes such as the integrated child development scheme icds mid day meal programmed in which suchfoods as preprocessed corn blend is being used extensively not only is such imported food hazardous to our health due to the use of genetically engineered soya but also our local nutrienthigh cereal and grain economy is being marginalized to support resource intensiveproduction systems of the developed countries 12 the government price support system must be reoriented to ensure the meeting of basics food needs for women and children we call upon the government to increase procurement prices to staple foods especially those of millets and legumes in order to encourage farmers to return togrowing essential food crops nonfood crops for example cotton tobacco and jute cultivated as raw materials for industries should have no government procurement prices since industries can directly pay remunerative prices to farmers 13 women have always played an important role in the production and processing of food cottage and small industries income are being taken over by mncs and big business companies encouraged by the government apart from destroying womens livelihoods this also leads to the flooding of the market with expensive unhealthy junk food food resources are being diverted on a largescale to this elite consumer market creating scarcity for households and rising price rises we205demand that food processing should be reserved for the smallscale sector such a reservation of the food processing industry for the small scale sector would be consistent with wto requirements of national treatment since we would be treating domestic industries in the same ways as mncs by excluding both from entry into the food processing industry 14 we call upon the government to restrict and ban all exports of essential food till all the fed we demand that the food needs of women and children of this country are met first and only the surpluses from meeting this need should be used for trade exports instead of women eating last and least relying on the leftovers for this sustenance we demand that global trade be left withthe leftovers only after the food rights of all within the country are met the government needs to maintain vigilant monitoring of production consumption and the food needs of all 52 women as knowledge keepers and custodians of cultural diversity nature has given us abundance womens indigenous knowledge of biodiversity agriculture and nutrition has built on that abundance to create more from less to create growth through sharing women farmers share seeds freely and with sharing as a base there can never be scarcity the giving and sharing of food in abundance has been the basis of ensuring food security the giving and sharing of knowledge has been the basis of the growth and evolution of knowledge an economy of sharing is an economy of abundance this worldview of abundance is based on sharing and on a deep awareness of human as members of the earth family this awareness that in impoverishing other beings we nourish ourselves is part of our present ecological knowledge and ancient wisdom without giving and sharing there can be no sustainability with our sustainability there can be no space diverse women for diversity dwd movement celebrates sharing for sustainability and peace

national and international debates since the uruguay round of gatt and the establishment of wt o on 111995 in the decade that has gone by two ministerial level meetings of wt o have collapsed in seattle in 1999 and in cancun in 2003 agriculture was at the core of the disagreements that led to the collapse the agreement on agriculture has now been recognized as being unequal and unfair with subsidies growing in therich north these subsidies being used for dumping artificially cheap products on the poor south destroying livelihoods and incomes most farm operations in india are womencentred food security depends on womens work womens knowledge womens skills in seedsaving in agricultural production in food processing in local marketing in cooking women are the providers of food and custodians of the heritage of biodiversity of crops and cultural diversity of food womens status power relevance is therefore being impacted by wt o rules at every level of the food chain the trade related intellectual property rights agreement is transferring control over knowledge of seed and biodiversity from rural women to global corporations the cases of the biopiracy of neem basmati and wheat are not justcases of attempts to transfer the heritage of the south to the north they are cases of usurping the knowledge and expertise of women the industrialized corporatised agriculture promoted by the agreement on agriculture is robbing women of livelihoods in food productionand food processing losses of incomes under conditions of poverty translate into the loss of life and dignity the rs1 trillion annual losses suffered by rural producers due to globalisation of agriculture are not just a financial loss they are leading to a human tragedy this study and public hearings commissioned by the national commission for women and carried out by the research foundation for science t echnology and ecology through its gender programme diverse women for diversity is the first assessment of the gender impact of wt o and the globalisation of agriculture ii the public hearings organized in four regions of india punjab bengal bundelkhand karnataka have allowed rural womnen to speak for themselves and the women have shown how the impact of wt o is not just economic loss of livelihoods and rural income these economic impacts translate into a social crisis rising costs of production and declining prices are leading to debt unpayable debtis forcing farmers to commit suicides and women farmers are left to look after their children without land without assets which have gone in paying the farm debt as livelihoods disappear women are being increasingly pushed to become victims of trafficking and women and children face the harshestconsequences of the collapse of the food security systems globalisation has increased the violence against women in all its forms economic political and physical the worst violence is expressed in the growing trends of female foeticide in high economic growth regions the women have spoken it is now the turn of policy makers to listen and formulate policy to protect the livelihood dignity and the very right to life of women the lives of women need to enter the calculus of economic growth if 8 growth translates into 8 women disappearing is our society richer or poorer are we more developed or more under developed the report on the impact of wt o on women in agriculture is a wake up call to the nation we are deep in an agrarian crisis and rural women are the worst victims but they are also at the cutting edge in creating alternatives that generate rural employment protect biodiversity promote healthy nutritious culturally diverse food systems women when organized are determined to keepfood security in their hands to defend the nations food security poornima advani place new delhi chairperson date january 2005 national commission for women ii preface diverse women for diversity the gender programme of the research
