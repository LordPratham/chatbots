diseases belong to green chemistry with short persistencecaution chemicals used to control i nsects diseases and weeds are poisons for human beings farmers are cautioned to use these poisons carefully to avoid any effect on human health v olume of spray material to be used for controlling different insects and diseases of various crops is based on the usage of shouldermounted knapsack sprayer having fixed type hollow cone nozzle spray volume may vary when other types of sprayersnozzles are used for this purpose it should however be ensured that the actual amount of pesticides recommended in the package of practices should not be reduced for proper control of weeds it is always necessary to use flood jet or flat fan spray nozzles11 cereals rice rice crop occupied 3168 lakh hectares in punjab with total paddy production of 20524 lakh tonnes 13751 lakh tonnes of rice during 202223 the average yield of paddy was 6479 quintals per hectare 2622 quintals per acre important hints to save water and for ease in management of paddy straw grow pau recommended short duration varieties avoid cultivation of pusa 44 peeli pusa dogar pusa as these require 1520 per cent more water and demand atleast two extra sprays of pesticides thereby lowering the net profit restrict to timely sowing of nursery 20 may20 june and timely transplanting 20 june10 july schedule for better grain quality water saving and low buildup of stem borers for higher yield and better grain quality from pr 126 transplant 2530 days old nursery adopt direct seeding of rice in tarwattar field from 1 june onwards for higher savings in irrigation water apply fertilizers as per soil test omit phosphorus application in rice following wheat that received recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer use nitrogen judiciously based on leaf colour chart lcc excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer encourages multiplication of insect pests and diseases to control false smut disease initiate the spray of recommended fungicides at boot stage of the crop plant hoppers feed at the base of rice plants and are often overlooked their damage is noticed only when the crop is hopper burnt hence regular monitoring of the insect population is necessary use of synthetic pyrethroids leads to increase in the population of rice planthoppers hence these insecticides should not be used for the control of rice insectpests stop irrigation about a fortnight before maturity harvesting should be done at proper maturity and varietywise avoid harvesting during night climatic requirements rice is best suited to regions of high temperature high humidity prolonged sunshine and assured watersupply in punjab high productivity of rice can be expected if the maximum temperature remains within 3440 3335 and 3235c minimum

stir the seed and remove immature grains which float at the top the heavy seeds will settle down at the bottom eight kg of heavy seed is sufficient for transplanting an acre heavy seed ensures healthy sturdy and uniform seedlings treat the seed with sprint 7 5 ws carbendazim mancozeb by making slurry of 3 g fungicide formulation in sow nursery of various varieties as per recommended schedule transplant 2530 days nursery of pr 126 level the fields with laser land leveller before direct sowing or transplanting of rice keep water standing in paddy field only for 2 weeks and thereafter apply irrigation 2 days after the ponded water has infiltrated into soil41012 ml water for one kg seed 24 g fungicide in 80100 ml water for 8 kg seed before sowing land preparation fertilizers and method of sowing mix 12 to 15 tonnes of well rotten farmyard manure or compost per acre in the soil irrigate the field to permit the germination of weeds plough the field twice after about a week to kill germinated weeds spread the treated seeds in 78 cm thick layer over wet gunny bags and cover them with wet gunny bags keep the layer of seeds moist by sprinkling water on it periodically the seeds sprout in about 24 to 36 hours apply 26 kg urea 60 kg single superphosphate and 40 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate 21 zn or 255 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate 33 zn per acre at sowing sow 8 kg seed by broadcasting on an area of 160 square meter 65 marlas to raise nursery for one acre to check the damage from birds broadcast a thin layer of welldecomposed farmyard manure immediately after broadcasting rice seed keep the soil moist by irrigating the field frequently apply another dose of 26 kg urea per acre about a fortnight after sowing so as to get the seedlings ready for transplanting in 2530 days however under forced circumstances if nursery of about 45 days or above is to be transplanted apply another dose of 26 kg urea after 4 weeks of sowing in case any insect attack or disease appears in the nursery adopt the recommended plant protection measures irrigate the nursery regularly the seedlings are ready when they are 2025 cm tall or with 6 to 7 leaves if the seedlings in the nursery show the yellowing of new leaves spray them three times with 051 ferrous sulphate solution 0510 kg ferrous sulphate dissolved in 100 litres of water per acre at weekly intervals if the leaves turn rusty brown after becoming yellow give a spray of 05 zinc sulphate heptahydrate solution 500 g zinc sulphate heptahydrate dissolved in 100 litres of water or 03 zinc sulphate monohydrate solution 300 g zinc sulphate monohydrate dissolved in 100 litres of water per acre weed control swank and some other annual grasses are the main problems in rice nursery these

select a location having fertile soil assured irrigation and minimum transportation distance of location to the field there should be no stones or other hard material in the soil the field should be preferably laser leveled and 20 metres away from tubewell and trees prepare the field at proper moisture spread polythene sheet 5060 gauge 90 cm wide having 12 mm dia perforations over it polythene sheets weighing 270 g spread to a length of about 15 meters for about 150 mats is sufficient for preparing seedlings for one acre place one or more iron frames over the polythene sheet having compartments of size 45212 cm for engine operated transplanter and 58282 cm for self propelled transplanter number and size of compartments vary according to machine specifications fill the soil from both sides of the frames uniformly upto the top surface 5spread 5060 g of pregerminated seed evenly in each compartment to achieve uniform density of 2 or 3 seedssq cm in the mat for uniform seed distribution use drum type nursery sowing seeder the length of nursery sowing seeder is to be equal to width of frame and has openings of 1 cm diameter on full length of the roller about 1012 kg seed is sufficient to sow about 150 mats required for transplanting in one acre cover the seeds by a thin layer of soil and sprinkle water by hand sprayer for proper setting of the soil lift frames and put these at the next place and repeat the above procedure for sowing the required number of seedling mats two persons can sow seedlings for 34 acres in a day after sowing irrigate the field on same day but the flow of water for first 23 irrigations should be very mild and level should be uniform so that there is no damage to newly formed mats care must be taken that the seedling mats should be always wet spray the fertilizer after an interval of about 10 days with 200 g urea dissolve in 15 litre water to150 mats the seedling mats will be ready after 2530 days of sowing drain water from the nursery field a few hours before uprooting of nursery give a cut with a sharp bladeknife along the nursery boundaries of the mat the uprooted nursery mats are ready for transport to the field tractor operated seeder for mat type paddy nursery the tractor operated seeder for mat type paddy nursery can be used to lay a 10 m wide perforated polythene sheet 5060 gauge over 10 m wide soil bed with simultaneous uniform seed placement over the soil bed for raising mat type nursery for mechanical paddy transplanters operations before transplanting organic manures prali char apply 6 tonnes of farmyard manure or 6 tonnes of press mud or 25 tonnes of poultry manure or 24 tonnes of dried gobar gas plant slurry or 20 tonnes prali char details of prali char are given under management of paddy straw per acre before preparatory tillage for transplanting of rice green manuring since organic manures are not available in required quantities green manuring with dhaincha cowpeasunnhemp is a very practicable alternative after harvesting wheat or any other preceding crop apply presowing irrigation rauni and sow 20 kg per acre of dhaincha seed presoaked in water for 8 hours or 12 kg per acre of cowpea 20 kg if bold seed is used or 20 kg per acre of sunnhemp up to the first week of may apply 75 kg superphosphate per acre to dhaincha cowpeasunnhemp in soils testing low in phosphorus and omit application of phosphorus to the succeeding rice crop bury 6 to 8 weeks old dhaincha cowpeasunnhemp one day before transplanting of paddy dhaincha should be prefered in kallar and recently reclaimed soils this practice results in saving of 25 kg of n 55 kg urea per acre if the moong crop after picking of pods has been incorporated one day before transplanting then reduce fertilizer n dose by onethird green manuring with dhaincha also ameliorates iron deficiency in rice rice straw incorporationretention continuous incorporationretention of rice straw improves soil health and rice yield whenever the soil organic carbon content come under high as per soil test report category or after 8 years reduces urea by 20 kg per acre in rice land preparation use laser land leveler for precision land leveling before puddling to enhance the efficiency of water and other farm inputs repair all bunds obtain a fine 6well levelled puddled field to reduce water loss through percolation to maintain good seedling vigour and to control weeds transplanting dates of transplanting time of transplanting is a single factor which influences rice yield substantially for getting maximum yield of rice and for the timely vacation of the field for sowing wheat and other crops transplant rice seedlings from 20 june to 10 july under late sown conditions prefer transplanting of pr 126 age of seedlings at transplanting use 3035 days old seedlings for medium duration varieties however for short duration variety pr 126 seedlings of 2530 days should be used transplanting of aged seedlings results in reduction of yield and quality uprooting of seedlings irrigate the nursery before uprooting wash the seedlings in water to remove mud seedling inoculation mix half kg packet of azospirillum biofertilizer with 100 litre of water dip the root of rice nursery seedlings for one acre in this solution for 45 minutes and transplant immediately the biofertilizer culture is available with the pau

chlorosis among seedlings appears in the youngest leaf about three weeks after transplanting plate no 2 page 189 plants die and often the crop fails completely start giving copious irrigations as soon as chlorosis appears and give 2 or 3 sprays of one per cent ferrous sulphate solution at weekly intervals 1 kg of ferrous sulphate in 100 litres of water per acre irrigation and drainage keep the water standing continuously in the crop for two weeks only after transplanting so that the seedlings get properly established afterwards apply irrigation two days after the ponded water has infiltrated into the soil to save irrigation water irrigate with tensiometer installed at 1520 cm soil depth at soil matric tension of 150 20 cm or when water level in tensiometer enters yellow strip every care should be taken that field does not develop cracks in this way irrigation water can be saved without causing any reduction in yield the depth of standing water should not exceed 10 cm drain away excess water before interculturing or weeding and irrigate the field after these operations stop irrigation about a fortnight before maturity to facilitate easy harvesting and the timely sowing of the succeeding rabi crop harvesting and threshing harvest the crop just when the ears are nearly ripened and straw has turned yellow if harvesting is delayed till the crop is dead ripe the shattering of grains occurs the milling quality of the grains is also affected combines are successfully used for harvesting paddy operate the combine at proper speed prefer combines fitted with a pau super sms straw management system for chopping and even distribution of straw after harvesting of paddy with such combines wheat can directly be sown with the help of happy seeder without burning of paddy straw tractordrawn vertical conveyor reaper windrower can also be used for harvesting paddy multicrop threshers can also be used for threshing paddy annexure v production of pure seed select a good plot of the standing crop and rogue it thoroughly so that it is made free from all admixtures and diseased plants harvest and thresh this plot separately dry the produce well and store separately in disinfested bins11marketing and storage marketing of the farm produce is an important function as income of the farmer to some extent depends upon it as per specified norms the moisture content in paddy should not be more than 17 per cent at the time of its marketing the farmer has to pay only unloading and cleaning charges of the produce the farmers are advised to get j form from the commission agent the produce kept for home use should be dried thoroughly in the sun for about a week and stored in bins or kept in a heap inside the room the optimum moisture content for storage is 12 per cent management of paddy straw in punjab about 220 lakh tonnes paddy straw is produced annually and a large portion of the straw is being burnt by the farmers the straw contains a significant amount of essential plant nutrients one tonne of paddy burning causes loss of 400 kg organic carbon 55 kg of n 23 kg of p 25 kg of k and 12 kg of s the burning of residue causes complete loss of nitrogen and sulphur due to burning of paddy straw poisonous gases like carbon dioxide carbon monoxide methane and nitric oxide are produced which are harmful for human and animal health to avoid burning of straw the following techniques are recommended 1 insitu management of paddy straw a wheat sowing with happy seeder happy seeder is recommended to sow wheat in combine harvested paddy field without any straw burning it is a pto driven machine operated by 45 hp tractor and it covers about 075080 acre per hour the loose straw needs to be spread uniformly in the field for the proper working of happy seeder it can be done manually or harvest the paddy by combine harvester fitted with pau super straw management system sms after the harvesting of paddy with combine fitted with super sms wheat can be sown with happy seeder or spatial zero till drill without straw burning the paddy straw acts as mulch which adversely affects the weed population in case the paddy is harvested with a combine without sms system use pau straw cutter cum spreader for chopping and spreading of paddy straw after chopping of straw sow wheat with pau happy seeder fitted with press wheels b wheat sowing with super seeder harvest paddy with combine harvester fitted with the pau super sms for sowing wheat with super seeder in combine harvested paddy field without any straw burning it is a pto driven machine operated by 55 hp or above tractor and it covers about 4555 acre per day c wheat sowing with pau smart seeder harvest paddy with combine harvester fitted with the pau super sms for sowing wheat with pau smart seeder in combine harvested paddy field without any straw burning it is a pto driven machine operated by 45 hp or above tractor and it covers about 78 acre per day d surface seeding surface seedingcummulching it is a lowcost and easy technique for insitu paddy residue management for timely sown wheat it does not require much costly machinery provides complete mulching and weed infestation is also less 12in this method wheat seed and basal fertilizer are uniformly broadcasted in a combine harvested paddy field it is followed by one pass of cuttercumspreader which cut the whole paddy straw at 45 inch above soil surface it is followed by irrigation to initiate germination of wheat for sowing one acre 45 kg wheat seed treated with recommended pesticides and 65 kg dap as basal fertilizer are used use pau surface seeder for sowing of wheat it consists of seed fertilizer box attachment with fluted roller metering system mounted on to a cuttercumspreader it is a low cost machine which sow wheat seed and apply basal fertilizer in a combine harvested paddy field and cut the whole straw simultaneously it is followed by irrigation alternatively combine harvester fitted with seeding attachment which sow wheat and apply basal fertilizer at the time of paddy harvest can be used it is followed by a single operation of cuttercumspreader and irrigation e incorporation chop the straw and stubbles with paddy straw chopper cum spreader after combine harvesting of paddy the chopped straw can be mixed in to the soil with rotary tillers after applying a light irrigation the field comes in wattar condition in 2 3 weeks depending on type of soil sow wheat seed with zero till drill or with conventional drill grow short duration rice varieties for increasing window period for straw management 2 management after removal of paddy straw use straw baler for baling the paddy straw after combine harvesting it collects the loose straw or complete straw after chopping the standing stubbles with stubble shaver these bales can be used for different purposes as follows a power generation eleven biomass power plants have been established in punjab for the generation of electricity from paddy straw bales heat produced by burning paddy straw is used to run steam turbine which further generates electricity b paddy straw based biogas plant paddy straw can be used in a specially designed biogas plant for bio gas production this biogas plant is filled one time with 16 quintal chopped paddy straw along with 45 quintal cattle dung and it provides 34 m3 biogas daily for 3 months c paddy straw geyser a geyser has been developed by the university for heating water by using paddy straw bales in this geyser about 100 litres of water can be heated to 45500c in 34 hours the water once filled in the geyser remains hot for up to 24 hours or even more d phospocompost phophocompost can be prepared from the paddy straw see details in orgrnic farming chapter e prali char prali char is a carbon rich porous product obtained after the partial combustion of rice straw at low temperatures in the presence of little or no oxygen it can be prepared in a pyramid or dome type kiln made up of bricks and clay to prepare 8 quintals of prali char from 12 quintals of rice straw the height of this dome should be 14 ft with 10 ft diameter two windows each at the top and at the bottom of the kiln are 13provided for loading of paddy straw six vents of 2 inch diameter in the upper portion and eight vents are provided at three heights on the remaining portion of the structure fill the kiln with rice straw up to top seal the lower loading window and ignite the straw from the top loading window and immediately seal it with clay the partial combustion of rice straw will start from the top and proceeds towards the bottom the emission of thin blue smoke from the vents indicates that the process of prali char formation is complete in this zone to facilitate the combustion in the next zone seal the vents located in the upper portion of the dome and likewise proceed to seal the vents of the middle and lower zone respectively the whole process usually takes about 1012 hours to seal the cracks developed during combustion and to cool the kiln pour a diluted mixture of clay and water on the outer surface of the kiln normally it takes about two days to cool however it can be cooled by sprinkling water for removing the prali char on the same day on an average it contains 3036 carbon 0506 nitrogen 016022 phosphorus and 16 22 potassium its application to rice and wheat 20 tacre saves 16 kg n 35 kg urea increases crop productivity and improves soil heal th besides paddy straw can also be used as mulch material in different crops mushroom cultivation

if colour of 6 or more out of 10 leaves is equal to or darker than specified lcc shades use of lcc should be discontinued after initiation of flowering and no more urea should be applied note the lcc is highly beneficial for optimum fertilizer nitrogen applications in fields amended with organic manures the leaves selected for measuring leaf greenness should be free of insectpest disease incidence there should not be any water stress to the crop and the nutrients other than nitrogen should be supplied as per recommendations the leaf colour chart can be purchased from the pau seed shop at gate no 1 krishi vigyan kendras and farm advisory service centres in different districts irrigation keep the water ponded continuously for 2 weeks after transplanting afterwards apply irrigation two days after the ponded water has infiltrated into the soil the crop should not suffer any water stress particularly during flowering stop irrigation about a fortnight before harvesting to facilitate easy harvesting and timely sowing of succeeding rabi crop harvesting and threshing basmati should be harvested as soon as the crop matures ie when the ears are nearly ripe and the straw has turned yellow delayed harvesting may cause overripening and shattering of grains the harvested crop should preferably be threshed on the same or next day of harvesting the delayed threshing causes high shattering losses reduced head rice recovery and ultimately reduces the market price of paddy monitor the insectpests regularly and apply insecticides on the basis of economic threshold level for effective

pathogen other practices to control the disease are same as for rice note manage the other diseases insects and rodents as per rice unpuddled direct seeded rice dsr the declining water resources of the state demand the highest priority to development of water conservation technologies direct seeding of rice in unpuddled fields dsr is one such technology that has water saving potential dsr provides several benefits such as 1 1020 saving in irrigation water 2 1012 higher ground water recharge 3 saves labor 4 less prone to infestation of diseases eg sheath blight foot rot 5 provides 100 kgacre higher yield of succeeding wheat as compared to conventional practice of puddled transplanted rice dsr technology was recommended in 2010 in the state the technology was further refined and in 2020 a novel dsr technique coined as tar wattar dsr was recommended in tarwattar dsr a major departure from the earlier practice is delayed first irrigation which is applied at 21 days after sowing which has many added advantages like higher saving in irrigation water better root development lesser incidence of nutrient deficiency especially iron lesser weeds and wider soil adaptability further a new method of dsr direct seeding on raised beds in tarwattar fields which offers higher saving in irrigation water as compared to earlier methods has been recommended in 2022 the success of dsr lies in the adoption of improved production practices which are discussed below suitable soils sow dsr only in medium to heavy textured soils its cultivation is not successful in light textured soils due to severe iron deficiency and lower crop yields laser levelling laser levelling improves irrigation water use efficiency and ensures better germination plough the field with disc harrow followed by cultivation with cultivator and planking then level the field with laser leveller suitable varieties short and medium duration varieties sowing time 115 june direct s eeding of rice should not be done on light textured sandy soils tarwattar dsr technique is suitable for direct seeding in medium and heavy textured soils including sandy loam loam silt loam and clay loam which accounts for around 87

10 litre water for 8 kg se ed for 12 hours dry the seed in shade and treat with 3 g sprint 75 ws mencozeb carbendazim per kg seed method of sowing rice can be direct seeded by three methods 1 direct seeding in tarwattar fields divide the field into kiyaras of desirable size after laser leveling and apply rauni irrigation when the field comes to tarwattar sufficiently high but workable soil moisture conditions prepare field kiyara wise with shallow cultivation followed by 23 plankings with load of 3 sandbags on planker and sow immediately seed should be placed at 34 cm depth in 20 cm spaced rows avoid field preparation and sowing during noon hours for better results preferably use lucky seed drill which sow rice and spray preemergence herbicide simultaneously for direct seeding alternatively use conventional rice drill having inclined plate metering system and spray herbicide immediately direct seeding with lucky seed drill fitted with press wheels help in tackling the problem of krand formation which occur if there is rainfall after sowing conserves soil profile moisture and improves the efficacy of preemergence herbicide 2 direct seeding on raised beds in tarwattar fields this method saves higher irrigation water than other two methods laser level the field and make 675 cm wide shallow beds bed with 375 cm flat top with adjacent 30 cm furrow preferably by using same bed planter that will be used for final sowing then apply rauni presowing irrigation in furrows only when field come to tarwattar conditions within 23 days depending on soil type use bed planter fitted with bed compacter for reshaping beds and simultaneous sowing 2 rowsbed of treated seed and apply preemergence herbicide immediately avoid sowing during noon hours for better results 3 direct seeding in dry fields treated seed should be placed 23 cm deep in rows spaced at 20 cm in a dry field and irrigation is applied immediately after sowing weed control preemergence spray 10 litre per acre stompbunker 30 ec pendimethalin in 200 litres of water for control of annual grass weeds and some broadleaf weeds in case of tarwattar dsr if sown using lucky seed drill sowing and herbicide spray are done simultaneously and if conventional rice drill is used then spray immediately after sowing in case of sowing in dry fields irrigation is applied immediately after sowing and herbicide is sprayed when the field comes to wattar condition which in general is within 1 to 2 days of sowing postemergence depending on the weed flora present in the field any of the herbicide listed in the

as recommended for irrigated maize plantprotection a insect pests maize borer the maize borer is a serious pest from june to september its larvae first scrape the leaves and then bore into the stem through the whorl or leaf sheath the central leaves of the attacked whorl get perforated in a young plant the growing point is killed and a deadheart results adopt the following integrated control measures kill the borer larvae hibernating in plant remnants like stubbles stalks cobs and cores plough up the fields after harvesting the maize crop collect the stubbles and destroy them use maize stalks cobs and cores by the end of february chop the remaining stalks if any for subsequent use for seed keep only healthy cobs free from borer attack remove and destroy the plants showing severe borer injury while hoeing the crop use trichocards twice having 40000 eggs of corcyra cephalonica parasitized by trichogramma chilonis per acre first release on 10 days old crop and second 7 days after the first release cut trichocards into 40 strips each having approximately 1000 parasitized regularly monitor the crop for the attack of fall armyworm use recommended insecticides for control of maize borer within 23 weeks of sowing control maize borer using trichogramma cards on 10 and 17 days old crop ensure proper drainage conditions and do not allow water to stagnate in the field to control bacterial stalk rot35eggs staple these strips uniformly on the underside of the central whorl leaves in evening hours these trichocards are available at the biocontrol labs department of

varieties such as jc 4 jc 12 pearl popcorn punjab sweet corn 1 j 1008 j 1007 and j 1006 can be used as seed for 34 years without any marked reduction in yield to maintain purity and the production potential of these varieties take the following precautions38 avoid admixture with other varieties avoid natural crosspollination with any other maize variety or hybrid growing in the nearby fields this can be done by isolating the composite maize plot from other maize fields by having no maize crop in a strip of about 200 metres all around or by growing one acre of composite maize and then selecting ears from the central portion of the field leaving a 9metre strip all round take about 5000 maize ears and mix the grains from all of them even if the seed requirement is small never bulk

infection collect the diseased ears from the crop before harvesting and destroy them by burning practise five year rotation with other crops grain smut smut is caused by tolyposporium penicillariae individual grains in an ear get transformed into smut balls which may later burst open to release millions of spores the spores upon dissemination cause secondary infection on the portion of the ear which is enclosed by the sheath of the upper leaf the intensity of the attack varies according to the humidity in the area remove the diseased ears early in the season and destroy them ergot this disease is caused by the fungus claviceps fusiformis at blossoming a pinkish or lightcoloured fluid honey dew exudes from the spikelets in different parts of the ear later dark sticky patches appear on the ear and small darkbrown sclerotia appear in place of grains between the glumes the seed set is poor or completely inhibited the 41ovary is replaced by a fungal mass with many folds on its surface the fungus perpetuates through the seedborne and soilborne sclerotia the contaminated grains if fed to cattle or used by human beings can cause poisoning therefore take the following precautions i for cattle do not feed the infected ears showing honeydew symptoms to cattle even the stems and leaves of such plants are not safe as cattle feed cut and burn a badly affected crop to reduce the amount of inoculum ii for human beings immerse the grains in 10 per cent salt solution the sclerotia being lighter than normal grains will float remove them with a sieve and burn them repeat the process two or three times prevention of ergot once the disease appears it is not possible to eliminate it take the following precautions to prevent its spread immerse seed in 10 per cent salt solution and remove the sclerotia and smutballs by skimming then wash the seed in ordinary water and dry it thoroughly burn the ears infested with honeydew as soon as they are observed in the field after harvesting the crop bury the debris with a furrow turning plough so that the ergot sclerotia rot in the soil after threshing the ergot affected crop the leftoverearheads of bajra in the threshing floor should also be burnt avoid sowing bajra in a field in which the crop had suffered heavily from ergot c birds see under chapter management of rodents and birds422 cotton american cotton

insecticides follow clean cultivation and destroy kanghi buti abutilon sp and peeli buti sida sp which act as collateral hosts parawilt parawilt is a physi ological disorder and no pathogen is involved it generally occurs after droughts when the crop is heavily irrigated or there is heavy rain plants show sudden drooping of leaves which ultimately get wilted but the root system remains intact plate no 6 page 190 the affected plants can be saved by spraying cobalt chloride 10 mg per litre of water 10 ppm immediately after the appearance of symptoms there would be no recovery if permanent wilting has already set in root rot this disease is caused by rhizoctonia solani and r bataticola the main symptom are drying and shedding of leaves leading to complete wilting and death of the plant the disease spreads in field in round patches the affected plants can be pulled out very easily the bark of the roots is broken into shreds bacterial blight it is caused by xanthomonas axonopodis pv malvacearum which survives in seed and plant debris lesions on the leaves appear as minute watersoaked angular spots which subsequently turn brown and then are transformed into black angular dead lesions on both sides of the leaf the bacterium also infects the young developing bolls and causes small round water soaked spots depressed in the centre use disease free seed leaf spots foliar leaf spots are caused by different fungi leaf spots caused by myrothecium roridum appear on leaves bracts as well as on bolls the disease is characterized by circular to semicircular brown coloured spots with broad violet margins 56at later stage shield shaped small size fruiting bodies appear in the central necrotic portion of the spot the pathogen is seed borne and also survives on the dead leaves high humidity and intermittant rains are congenial for the development of the disease the fungus alternaria gossypina also causes blightening of the leaves in the early stages the spots have a pale green area with irregular margins as the spots enlarge irregular concentric zones are formed sometimes severe shedding of leaves occur due to this disease the plants with low vigour because of drought or deficiency of potash favour the development of this disease the disease perpetuates through diseased debris another type of leaf spots are caused by cercospora sp which generally appears towards the end of the season it produces small circular to irregular spots having whitish centre with dark brown margin in advance stages necrotic central portion may fall out giving shot hole appearance low temperature 25oc and high relative humidity favours development of disease diseased debris is the main source of primary inoculum of the disease use disease free seed to control

they also damage buds flowers and pods for management egg masses and young larvae of tobacco caterpillar feeding gregariously should be collected along with leaves and destroyed blister beetle blistle beetle is diurnal and general feeder adult beetles are robust with bright black and red stripes on the forewings when disturbed the beetles emit a fluid containing cantharidin that causes blisters on human skin the adult beetles attack arhar moong mash and other pulse crops the major damage is caused at the flowering stage they feed on tender buds and flowers of the plant thus preventing pod formation pod borer helicoverpa armigera the larvae damage the crop by feeding on leaves flower buds flowers pods and seeds in the pods thus causing heavy loss in yield the larvae may be pale green yellow brown or black in colour measuring about 35 cm in length when fully grown larval presence can be observed from damage to plant and from dark green faeces below the plants on the soil the larvae

important hints plant c rop do not plant the crop in a field where the preceding crop was infected with red rot or wilt use seed cane from a healthy and completely disease free seed crop use recommended seed rate to ensure good stand of the crop avoid late planting it reduces tillering and the crop is more prone to attack by insect pests especially shoot borer keep the crop free from weeds using cultural control measures and recommended chemicals do not apply excessive dose of nitrogen than recommended over dose will cause lodging of the crop resulting in poor cane yield and quality do not allow the crop to suffer from water stress especially during hot months to prevent lodging earth up the crop in mayjune and prop up the crop during august september ratoon crop do not ratoon a diseased crop do not harvest the crop to be ratooned before the end of january harvest the crop as close to the ground as possible remove the trash and irrigate the field remove late tillers and water shoots interculture the crop with tractor drawn tillers or rotary weeder to control weeds during early stages of growth alternatively adopt chemical control measures fill the gaps by planting three budded setts in the beginning of march inspect the ratoon crop regularly to prevent the attack of early shoot borer and black bug as it is more prone to damage by these insects hints for obtaining high sugar recovery do not plant whole area under a single variety plant recommended early and midlate maturing varieties in the ratio of 32 on area basis save the crop from lodging by timely earthing up and propping save the crop from diseases and insect pests through recommended control measures protect the crop from frost by giving light irrigations avoid excessive irrigation and late application of nitrogen near crop maturity harvest the crop at proper maturity ratoon crop should be harvested first ensure removal of roots mud trash and immature tops spindles at the time of harvest supply cane to sugar mills without excessive binding material immediately after harvesting as staling reduces sugar recov ery 71climatic requirements sugarcane is best suited to regions having

exceeds 5 level earth up slightly to prevent the granules from flowing with the irrigation water and irrigate the crop immediately this operation will control the third brood of the topborer which does the maximum damage take the following precautions in using carbofuran85 use rubber gloves while applying carbofuran granules never handle these granules with bare hands a mask should be used to cover the face mix it with the moist soil to reduce the chances of its falling into the eyes of the person applying it the person applying these granules should not eat or drink anything without washing his hands thoroughly with soap carbofuran tr eated sugarcane leaves and weeds should not be fed to cattle for about one month after the treatment stalk borer or tarai borer this pest is active throughout the year the larvae overwinter in the stubble and watershoots the attack remains low during apriljune and increases in july its incidence is highest during octobernovember there are no outward symptoms of the attack of this pest entrance or exit holes on the attacked canes can be seen only after stripping a larva sometimes damages upto 3 nodes and the cane may be attacked at several places the cane yield and sugar recovery are adversely affected in the case of serious attack the control measures against the pest are as under do not use t he caneseed from the infested field use

damaged crop looks pale during augustoctober the underside of the leaves is full of nymphs and pupae which suck the sap from the leaves the leaves turn black due to the development of a fungus sugarcane thrips the thrips damage the crop from april to june this pest suck the sap from the partly opened leaf and tips of the younger leaves resulting in withering and drying of leaftip which get rolled inwardly the thrips prefer plant crop than ratoon crop sugarcane mite the mite appears from april to june and feeds on the lower side of the leaves under a fine web the leaves turn red and later appear to be burnt the growth of the affected crop is retarded during the premonsoon period baru sorghum halepense is the alternative host plant from which this mite spreads to the sugarcane crop so destroy the weed if growing near the sugarcane fields gurdaspur borer this borer appears from june to october and causes the withering of the central leaves notably the 5th leaf followed by the total drying up of the tops the affected canes break at the point of attack with a slight jerk rogue out canes showing withered tops in the afternoon every week from june to september the tops should be cut 86off well below the point of attack the timely rogueing of affected plants is very important for controlling the pest bury the roguedout plants do not ratoon a heavily affected crop plough up the fields not meant for ratooning and destroy the stubbles before june b diseases red rot red rot is caused by the fungus colletotrichum falcatum the disease appears from july till the crop is harvested the third or fourth leaf of cane from top shows yellowing at first while rest of the leaves also loose colour afterwards and dry up later the whole clump dries up on splitting open the cane the tissue is found to be reddened but the discoloration is not uniform and is interspersed with white patches running across the width of the split cane the pith of affected cane emits alcoholic smell the control measures against this disease are as under use seed from absolutely disease free seed plot do not plant sugarcane in the disease affected fields for one year grow varieties fairly resistant to red rot crush the affected crop early and plough up the fields soon after harvesting the crop collect and burn the stubbles rogue out and bury the diseased canes uproot the entire clumps and not merely the affected stalks do not ratoon the diseased crop wilt this disease is caused by cephalosporium sacchari or fusarium moniliforme it appears from july till the crop is harvested the leaves of the affected cane at first turn yellow and finally the top dries up on splitting open a diseased cane the pith shows a dirty red discoloration near the nodes the discoloration is invariably darker than that in the remaining portion of the internodes the affected stalks become light and hollow the control measures against this disease are the same as those for red rot as the causal fungus persists in the soil over long period the affected field should not be cultivated with sugarcane for 3 years smut smut is caused by ustilago scitaminea this disease is prevalent throughout the year but is severe from may to july and again in octobernovember its incidence increases in the ratoon crop it is easily recognised by the appearance of long whiplike shoots covered with dusty black mass of spores these whips may arise from the top of the canes as well as from the lateral sprouted buds adopt the following control measures use only smut free canes for seed reject even the healthy looking canes in the diseased stools or those growing in the vicinity of the smut infected clumps remove the smut whips gently without shaking after putting them inside a closely woven drill bag then uproot the entire diseased clumps and bury them deep immerse the bag used for collecting the smut whips in boiling water for 5 minutes after every roguing of the crop do not ratoon the smut infected crop 87ratoon stunting a coryniform bacterium clavibacter xyli has been found to be associated with the disease the affected crop remains stunted with thin canes the leaves are comparatively pale and the roots are poorly developed the disease can be identified by slicing mature canes longitudinally a little below the rind with a sharp knife in the lower part of the node parallel to the zone of the whitish waxy band the pith shows discolored dots commas and straight or bent streaks upto 2 to 3 mm in length they may be yellow orange pink red or reddish brown do not use the diseased crop for planting select the caneseed from a vigorously growing and healthy crop the moist hot air treatment of seed canes at 54oc for 4 hours is effective in destroying the causal organism do not ratoon the diseased crop grassy shoot disease the disease is caused by mycoplasma like bodies the affected plants give rise to numerous thin tillers the leaves become reduced in size thin narrow and usually turn chlorotic if the attack is light one or two weak canes may be formed uproot and destroy the affected clumps immediately after appearance the moist hot air treatment of the seedcanes at 54c for 4 hours inactivates the causal organisms of this disease its incidence increases in the ratoon crop therefore do not ratoon the diseased crop red stripe red stripe is a bacterial disease caused by pseudomonas rubrilineans it appears during juneaugust the affected leaves show bright red streaks which are long narrow and run longitudinally on the leafblade causing the rotting of tops in severe cases rogue out the affected canes and burn or bury them top rot pokkah boeng this disease is caused by fusarium moniliforme it appears during the rainy season from julyseptember the young leaves in the top portion of the plant become chlorotic at the base and get distorted and shortened they turn dark red and fall off gradually in severe cases the rotting of the top portion of the cane occurs remove the affected clumps and bury them leaf scald the disease is caused by the bacterium xanthomonas albilineans whitish or cream coloured one or two narrow stripes are observed on the leaf extending sometimes down to leaf sheath the affected plants produce sideshoots starting first from lower nodes with similar stripes on young leaves the stripes become reddish and later the leaves start withering from top downwards giving scalded appearance on splitting open the affected canes reddish brown vascular streaks are observed in the internodes sometimes affected plants suddenly wilt and die without any obvious internal symptoms as the disease is sett borne healthy and disease free seed should be planted treatment of seedcane with moist hot air at 54c for 4 hours inactivates the bacterium sterilization of cutting knives by flaming or by dipping in 2 lysol solution during seed preparation should be practised to minimise spread of the disease rog ue out the diseased clumps c rodents being a long duration crop sugarcane provides shelter to rodents and suffers heavy damage the rat bendicota b engalensis which digs extensive burrows with characteristic soil heaps is often abundant in sugarcane a lodged crop gets highly damaged for effective rodent control in sugarcane see chapter management of rodents and birds 88management of seed crop to obtain diseasefree seed a separate seed nursery should be maintained do not use the commercial crop for seed as many pests and diseases go unnoticed in such a crop alternatively tissue culture raised plants can also be used to raise a healthy seed crop the plants should be spaced 60 cm apart with a row to row spacing of 90 cm followed by immediate irrigation the crop thus raised should be used for raising a subsequent seed crop by planting three budded setts following conventional practices for seed production the following package of practices are recommended plant the crop in the last week of march obtain the seed stalks propagated from moist hotairtreated seed the treated seed is planted at the research stations and is further propagated at the sugar factory farms and the farms of selected cane growers this seed is supplied to the growers to raise the seedcrop give a fertilizer dose of 90 kg of n 195 kg urea per acre apply nitrogen in 3 equal doses ie at planting in may and in midjuly high dose of nitrogen will result in good quality of immature seed cane follow plant protection schedule strictly to keep the crop free from insect pests and diseases frost injury results in low germination of sugarcane therefore protect the seed crop against frost by irrigating it frequently during december and january 895 oilseed crops groundnut groundnut was grown on 17 thousand hectares during 202223 in punjab

necessary depending upon the seasonal rainfall give first irrigation at flowering if the rainfall during the crop season is not adequate apply one or two more irrigations depending upon the time of recession of monsoon during the pod formation period for proper development of pods another irrigation a few days before the harvesting may be applied for full recovery of pods from soil harvesting and threshing the spring sown crop matures by the end of june to early july crop sown during end aprilend may is ready for harvesting towards end of august to early september foliage of spring and kharif sown crop remains green at maturity appearance of brown to black lines on the inner side of the pod shell and change of colour of kernels to pink are the indications of maturity of the crop the rainfed crop is normally ready for harvesting towards the beginning of november a reliable indication of maturity is the uniform yellowing of leaves as well as the shedding of older leaves the tractor mounted groundnutdigger shaker developed at the punjab agricultural university may be used for quick harvesting annexure v for its efficient harvesting the soil should have adequate moisture and the crop should not be overripe leave the harvested crop in small heaps for two days for curing after curing collect the crop at one place and give 2 or 3 shakings and beatings daily for 2 to 3 days with a toothed rake or trangli to separate pods and leaves from the stalk collect the pods and leaves into a heap and winnow tractor operated thresher can be used in place of manual threshing after curing

insect is serious in some areas only the adult beetles emerge from 92the soil during junejuly with the first showers of rain they congregate on the nearby trees such as ber guava rukmanjani grapevines almonds etc and feed on their leaves during night the eggs are laid in the soil and the larvae grubs hatching from them eat away the rootlets or root hairs of the groundnut plants the damaged plants look pale wilted and ultimately die adopt the following integrated approach for its effective management plough the field twice during mayjune to expose the beetles resting in the soil sow the crop early wherever possible treat the seed with 2 ml neonix 20 fs imidacloprid 185 hexaconazole 15 per kg seed before sowing hairy caterpillar hairy caterpillar if appearing in epidemic form causes serious damage by feeding on the leaves and tender stems when young they feed gregariously the grownup caterpillars migrate from one field to another for management monitor the fields regularly collect and destroy the egg masses and young gregariously feeding larvae the grown up caterpillars can be destroyed by crushing them under feet or by picking and putting them into kerosenized water termite this insect damages the crop after sowing and feeds on roots and shoots by making tunnels damaged plants wilt dry and can be easily pulled out damaged plants can be differentiated from white grub damage in that the tunnels made by termites and damaged pods are filled with soil treat the seeds before sowing with 2 ml neonix 20 fs imidacloprid 185 hexaconazole 15 per kg seed b diseases collarrot and seedrot this disease is caused by aspergillus niger and other seed and soil borne fungi which may cause seed rot before germination or the germinating seedlings may develop rotting lesion at the collar region tikka or cercospora leafspot this disease is caused by cercospora personata and c arachidicola disease develops rapidly at a temperature range of 2530oc coupled with high relative humidity control the above diseases by adopting the following integrated measures select healthy and unblemished kernels for seed treat the kernels before sowing as describe under seed treatment on page no 90 spray the crop with 500 to 750 g per acre sultaf 50 wp wettable sulphur in 200 to 300 litres of water give 3 or 4 sprays at fortnightly intervals starting from the first week

agronomic practices land preparation the crop requires a wellprepared seedbed give two or three ploughings followed by planking time of sowing the crop should be sown in the first fortnight of july after receipt of adequate rain or with the application of presowing irrigation the crop sown early in june suffers from phyllody disease seed rate and method of sowing the seed rate is 1 kg per acre sow the seeds at row to row spacing of 30 cm the seeds should be sown 4 to 5 cm deep with a pora or tube attached to the desi plough after complete germination extra plants should be thinned to maintain plant to plant spacing of 15 cm sow the crop during first fortnight of july as early sown crop is more prone to the attack of phyllody disease remove phyllody infected plants time to time and burry them to check further spread of the disease to avoid shattering of seeds harvest the crop immediately when plants turn yellow and capsules have just opened94fertilizer application drill 21 kg n 45 kg urea per acre before sowing avoid excessive manuring as it induces heavy vegetative growth weed control weeds can be controlled by giving one hoeing at about threeweeks after sowing harvesting and threshing harvest the crop in time to avoid shattering of seeds the plants turn pale at maturity harvest the crop immediately when capsules have just opened after harvesting tie the plants into small bundles and stack these bundles in upward direction two shakings of the bundles are enough to collect the entire produce plantprotection a insectpests sesame leaf webber and capsule borer the larvae of these insects roll the leaves and feed inside these rolls or bore into the capsule and feed on developing grains if the infestation takes place at early stage the plants die sow the crop at recommended time timely sown crop is less affected by insect jassid it causes considerable damage to the crop by sucking the sap and transmitting mycoplasma which induces the malformation of the inflorescence avoid early sowing in june as early sown crop suffers heavily from this pest b diseases phyllody it is caused by a mycoplasma like organism mlo the flowers are modified into leaf like structures and do not bear capsules it is transmitted by jassid orosius albicinctus therefore control of jassid is required also rogue out the diseased plants to prevent further spread blight cercospora sesami it appears at flowering stage as dark brown angular lesions with grey centre on leaves it also appears on petiole stem and capsules the diseased plants give blighted appearance followed by defoliation avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers and keep the field free from weeds and debris956 fodder crops the area under fodder crops in the state remains around 90 lakh hectares 53 lakh hectare in kharif and the annual production is about 710 lakh tonnes of green fodder as per 20th livestock census2019 the total livestock population in punjab is 705 lakh out of which 655 lakh are bovines which are to be provided sufficient fodder of good quality each bovine gets green fodder supply of about 30 kg per day but actually 40 kg green fodder per animal is required therefore the present availability of green fodder is inadequate on the basis of requirement per animal per day approximately 956 lakh tonnes of green fodder is required with the increase of crossbred animals which need more fodder its deficiency will be further aggravated unless efforts are made to increase the production of fodder therefore fodder production in the state need to be substantially increased important hints the supply of protein to animals from legumes is cheaper than from concentrates the nonlegume forages are rich in energy fodders should be grown as mixtures in which legumes such as cowpea guara and nonlegumes such as maize sorghum and bajra are grown together follow recommended time of sowing and seed rate and treat the seed before sowing use fertilizers in balanced amount to get better quality of fodder cut the fodder crop at proper stage irrigate the fodder crop one week before cutting especially to sorghum and bajra to minimize antiquality factors avoid use of unrecommended agrochemicals on fodder crops as this may be harmful to dairy animals plants attacked by any insectpests should be uprooted and destroyed do not grow fodder crops on soils high in

days of sowing using 200 litres of water there is a common practice with the farmers to grow pure maize fodder upto end september and this is followed by wheat use of atrataf 50 wp atrazine can be extended upto the first half of september however atrazine should not be used where maize fodder is sown in mixture with cowpea fertilizer application apply ten tonnes per acre of good quality farm yard manure before preparing the land this application mitigates zinc deficiency and also meets all the p and k requirement and onethird of nitrogen the fodder maize shows a remarkable response to application of nitrogen to the soils of medium fertility apply the fertilizers as recommended for the composite maize drill half n and all p and k at sowing apply the remaining nitrogen after 34 weeks irrigation fodder maize requires 45 irrigation during summer and during kharif season irrigate the field as per rains harvesting harvest the crop when the plants are between the milk ripe stage and the dough stage of grain development 5060 days after sowing from silking onwards the nutritive value of the plant is mainly in the grains hence do not remove cobs from that fodder crop preserve surplus fodder maize as silage see the procedures for hay and silage making seed production as recommended for composite maize plant protection maize borer attacks the crop from march to october for effective control the attacked plants should be uprooted and destroyed after 23 weeks of sowing it can also be controlled with spray of 40 ml coragen 185 sc chlorantraniliprole in 6080 litres of water per acre do not feed the fodder for atleast 21 days after the spray of coragen alternatively use trichocards twice having 50000 eggs of corcyra cephalonica per acre parasitized by trichogramma

given in the grain bajra crop plant protection a insect pests root bug this insect causes damage to the bajra crop in southwestern districts grasshopper grey weevil and pyrilla also attack this crop b disease ergot this disease is caused by the fungus claviceps fusiformis at blossoming a pinkish or lightcoloured fluid honey dew exudes from the spikelets in different parts of the ear later dark sticky patches appear on the ear and small darkbrown sclerotia appear in place of grains between the glumes the seed set is poor or completely inhibited the ovary is replaced by a fungal mass with many folds on its surface the fungus perpetuates through the seedborne and soilborne sclerotia102the contaminated grains if fed to cattle or used by human beings can cause poisoning therefore take the following precautions i for cattle do not feed the infected ears showing honeydew symptoms to cattle even the stems and leaves of such plants are not safe as cattle feed cut and burn a badly affected crop to reduce the amount of inoculum ii for human beings immerse the grains in 10 per cent salt solution the sclerotia being lighter than normal grains will float remove them with a sieve and burn them repeat the process two or three times prevention of ergot once the disease appears it is not possible to eliminate it take the following precautions to prevent its spread immerse seed in 10 per cent salt solution and remove the sclerotia and smutballs by skimming then wash the seed in ordinary water and dry it thoroughly burn the ears infested with honeydew as soon as they are observed in the field after harvesting the crop bury the debris with a furrow turning plough so that the ergot sclerotia rot in the soil after threshing the ergot affected crop the leftoverearheads of bajra in the threshing floor should also be burnt avoid sowing bajra next year in a field in which the crop had suffered heavily from ergot c bird see under management of rodents and birds napierbajra hybrid it is a vegetatively propagated bajra like grass developed at the punjab agricultural university ludhiana it is perennial but yields most of the fodder between march and november the crop once planted gives fodder for 23 years climatic requirements this hybrid requires hot and moist climate and can be grown under irrigated conditions throughout the punjab state soil type this hybrid can be grown on a variety of soils but heavy soils are best for getting a high green fodder yield improved varieties pbn 342 2019 it is a leafy hybrid with long smooth nonhairy and broad leaves it sprouts earlier in spring and remains in vegetative growth till the onset of winter it yields 877 quintal of green fodder per acre pbn 346 2016 it is a leafy hybrid with long smooth nonhairy and broad leaves it sprouts earlier in spring and remains in vegetative growth till the onset of winter the silage quality of this hybrid is better than pbn 233 it yields 715 quintal of green fodder per acre103pbn 233 2000 it is nonhairy with smooth long and broad leaves it maintains its active vegetative growth for longer duration than pbn 83 because it sprouts earlier in spring and remains in vegetative growth upto onset of winter its winter dormancy period is about 15 days less than pbn 83 it yields 1100 quintals of green fodder per acre agronomic practices land preparation the land should be prepared well and should be free from weeds give the first ploughing with a disc harrow and subsequent two ploughings with a cultivator planking should follow every ploughing time and method of planting napierbajra hybrid can be planted from the last week of february to may the planting should be completed by midapril to avoid high mortality of root slips the crop planted after may does not give sufficient yield during the kharif season it can be propagated vegetatively from root slips or stem cuttings rootslips 30 cm long or stem cuttings with two or three nodes are used for planting approximately 11000 slips or cuttings are required to plant one acre a small part of the shoot or rootslip is allowed to remain exposed and the rest of the slip is buried in the soil the stem cuttings can also be planted like sugarcane sets in 7 or 8 cm deep furrows which are afterwards filled with soil the furrows may be made with a furrower the crop should be planted at 90 x 40 cm or 60 x 60 cm apart in lines under good conditions of soil moisture after planting apply 4 tonnes of rice straw mulch per acre to save water weed control two hand hoeings at 21 and 42 days after planting effectively manage the seasonal weeds fertilizer application napier bajra hybrid is quick growing and responds to high fertility to the newly planted crop add 20 tonnes of farmyard manure or town compost to the soil before planting and apply 30 kg of n 66 kg of urea per acre fifteen days after planting repeat this fertilizer dose after each cutting to the ratoon crop apply 38 kg of p2o5 240 kg of single superphosphate per acre every year in two doses the first half in spring and the second half during the monsoon the nitrogen dose for the ratoon crop is same as in newly planted crop irrigation crop should be irrigated at 810 days interval during hot and dry months in the midseason however irrigate after every 10 to 14 days drain away excess water from the field during the rainy season intercropping during winter when the hybrid is dormant oats senji metha or sarson can be intercropped harvesting the first cutting is ready in about 50 days after planting take subsequent cuttings when the crop is about one metre high if the crop is allowed to grow beyond this height its nutritive value falls drastically note if the fodder is not harvested at optimum stage one metre plant height and allowed to attain a height more than 2 metre its use as a sole fodder should be avoided because such fodder becomes more lignified less palatable and poorly digestible the feeding of such fodder may cause rumen impaction banh thereby resulting in constipation in some cases blood spots may appear with dung104guinea grass it is high qualit y multicut summer fodder its plants have profuse tillering and more leaves it is cultivated as annual fodder crop climatic and soil requirements it can be sown all over the state it does best on well drained soils excessive moisture during germination kills the germinating seedling hence a light irrigation should be given particularly in heavy soils improved varieties pgg 518 1998 its plants are erect with profuse tillering and leafy growth its leaves are longer and broader than pgg 101 it flowers 57 days later than pgg 101 and thus maintains its forage quality for a longer period the loss of nutrients is less in this variety if harvesting is delayed due to unavoidable circumstances to harvest maximum nutrients cut the crop for fodder at boot stage in 56 cuttings from may to november it produces 750 quintals green fodder per acre it has low degree of seed shattering its panicles are initially white in colour which change to lightyellow on maturity agronomic practices time and method of sowing guinea grass may be sown from midmarch to mid may six to eight kg seed per acre is sown by kera in furrows 25 cm apart drawn by plough cultivator it can also be sown by broadcast in furrows prepared with cultivator followed by light planking with jindraraking the field should be irrigated immediately after sowing fertilizer application being a multicut grass it responds to high fertility apply 20 tonnes of fym to the soil before preparing the field apply 20 kg n 44 kg urea per acre 20 days after sowing and the second dose of 10 kg n 22 kg urea per acre 35 days after sowing after each cutting apply 30 kg n 66 kg urea with first irrigation irrigation first irrigation to guinea grass is given immediately after sowing second light irrigation essential for germination is given after about 46 days of first irrigation as soon as the surface gets dry subsequent irrigations are given at an interval of a week in summer and 10 days during septembernovember during rainy season irrigation is applied as and when needed excessive standing water must be drained away at the early seedling stage particularly in heavy soils harvesting the first cutting in guinea grass is ready in about 55 days after sowing subsequent cuttings are taken at an interval of 2530 days harvesting very close to the ground delays the next cutting and may result in the death of stumps particularly in rainy season seed production the crop sown for fodder is left for seed production in the last week of august and the seed gets matured by mid of october plant remains still green when seed matures the seed crop is ready for harvest when the seed from the tip of the ear starts shattering all the ears should be removed immediately and the green fodder could be fed to the animals later on about 250 kg seed can be produced from one acre one more fodder cutting may be taken from the same crop in november105guara guara is a highly nutritious leguminous fodder for the animals its dry pods and husk are relished by the cattle it also enriches the soil soil type guara grows well on all types of soils welldrained medium to light soils are very suitable improved variety guara 80 1982 it is recommended for barani as well as irrigated conditions for cultivation throughout the state it is tall quickgrowing hairy and profusely branched type this variety does not possess bunches on each node it is a late maturing variety and yields about 125 quintals per acre of green fodder per acre agronomic practices land preparation one or two ploughings and a planking are sufficient seed rate and sowing use 1820 kg seed per acre the crop may be sown from may to midaugust the sowing should be done at a row to row distance of 30 cm by drill pora or kera method guara can be grown under notillage to obtain the same green fodder yield as after conventional or zero till sown wheat fertilizer application drill 9 kg of n 20 kg urea and 24 kg p2o5 150 kg single superphosphate per acre before sowing in the irrigated areas irrigation if the rainfall is welldistributed the crop does not need any irrigation generally 1 or 2 irrigations are required depending upon the rainfall harvesting the optimum stage of harvesting is between 90100 days after sowing corresponding to 100 per cent of flowering and pod initiation stages respectively seed production as recommended in guara seed crop plant protection measures bihar hairy caterpillar bhaboo kuta attacks the crop during septemberoctober it can be controlled by collecting and destroying the egg masses and gregarious young larvae of the pest cowpea the cultivation of cowpea is recommended in the irrigated areas of the punjab state it can also be grown mixed with maize bajra and sorghum to get not only higher yield but also increased nutrients from the green fodder it enables the dairy cattle to maintain good milk yield during the hot and dry summer soil type welldrained loamy soil is conducive to a proper growth of the crop improved varieties cl 367 2005 it is dual purpose variety suitable for fodder as well as pulse purpose 106its plants are erect with dark green leaves it is tolerant to yellowmosaic virus and anthracnose diseases its fodder quality is superior in terms of total digestible nutrients tdn and digestible crude protein dcp it bears large number of pods its seeds are small in size and creamish white in colour the variety is also suitable for human consumption because it has very good cooking quality on an average it yields about 108 quintals of green fodder and 49 quintals of grains per acre agronomic practices land preparation two ploughings followed by plankings are sufficient seed rate and sowing time for fodder sow 12 kg seed of cl 367 per acre from march to midjuly when sown mixed with maize seed rate is 6 kg of cl 367 and 15 kg of maize per acre seed inoculation dilute the 100 ml pack of liquid biofertilizer burkholderia seminalis in one litre of water and thoroughly mix with the seed for one acre on a cemented floor air dry the treated seeds under shade and sow seed within two hours of inoculation method of sowing sow with a pora or seedcumfertilizerdrill or zero till drill in rows 30 cm apart fertilizer application drill 75 kg n 165 kg urea as a starter dose and 22 kg of p2o5 140 kg single superphosphate per acre at sowing in case cowpea fodder succeeds wheat which had received recommended level of p omit the application of p to cowpea irrigation and drainage the crop sown in may needs fortnightly irrigation till the advent of the monsoon in all 4 or 5 irrigations will be sufficient adequate drainage results in a good yield harvesting harvesting stage of cowpea is between 5565 days after sowing which corresponds to preflowering stage and would produce good quality fodder seed production sow 8 kg seed in first week of august in lines 30 cm apart in proper soil moisture the fertilizer application is the same as for the fodder crop plant protection a insectpests jassid and black aphid these insects attack this crop bihar hairy caterpillar bhaboo kuta it attacks cowpea from august to november to keep cowpea free from attack of this pest plant a row of til sesamum around cowpea field at the time of its sowing females prefer to oviposit on til rows from where larvae in gregarious phase should be collected and destroyed mechanically stored grain insects pulse beetle dhora causes severe damage to stored cowpea grains for its control see stored grain insects in annexure vi b diseases seed rot and seedling mortality it is caused by various seedborne microflora the infected seeds are shrivelled and discoloured infected seedlings are killed before these emerge out of soil and cause poor stand of the crop107fodder mixtures it is advisable to grow fodders whenever possible as mixtures rather than as monocultures crop mixtures which combine a nonlegume such as maize jowar and bajra with a legume such as cowpea and guara provide a balanced diet for animals because legumes are important source of proteins and nonlegumes are rich in energy these mixtures would often require lower amounts of nitrogen application because of the legume component some of these mixtures can be sown more than once during the kharif harvest the fodder mixture when maize is in the milkripe to dough stages when sorghum has onehalf to onethird heads out and when bajra shows the emergence of ears from the flag leaves bajra and sorghum can be successfully grown alone as well as in mixture with guara and cowpea in the rainfed kandi tract of the state guara and cowpea are also suitable fodder crops for monoculture in that area silage making an adequate supply of quality fo dders during the lean periods of novemberdecember and mayjune can be ensured by preserving the green fodder as silage and hay non legume kharif fodders such as maize sorghum bajra napier bajra hybrid and guinea grass which are rich in soluble sugars and low in protein possess excellent qualities for conserving as silage stage of harvesting harvest the crop for silage making when nutrient contents are at their peak stage and it has enough dry matter a crop with 3035 per cent dry matter conserves into a high quality silage the optimum time for harvesting fodder crops for ensiling is given below crop stage of harvest sorghum and maize flowering to milk stage bajra boot stage napierbajra hybrid and guinea grass 1 metre tall crops harvested at the above given stages usually have the desired dry matter content however napier hybrid and guinea grass need one or two days drying in the field before chaffing to reduce the moisture to test the proper dry matter content take a handful of chaffed fodder in between the hands and press it to form a ball if the hands do not get moist then the fodder has the desired dry matter silotrench the size of silotrench depends upon the availability of green fodder number of animals quantity and period for which it is to be fed to animals on an average in one cubic metre space 56 quintals of chaffed green fodder can be packed in a 10 metre long 3 metre wide and 15 metre deep silotrench about 350400 quintals of chopped green fodder can be packed length and the width of the silotrench can vary with the number of animals and their fodder requirement but depth should always be kept at 15 to 1082 metres the trench should be made on a high level spot near the animal shed it should be made pucca and cement plastered method of silage making chop the harvested crop to the length of 5 to 8 cm and pack into the silo trench press the chopped crop in the trench thoroughly with a tractor or bullock and raise it to 1 metre above the ground level to create proper anaerobic conditions to make quality silage every half metre thick layer of chaffed fodder should be regularly pressed cover the fodder with 1015 cm thick layer of kadbi or wheat bhusa put the mud on it and finally mudplaster see that the silotrench is completely airtight alternately a plastic sheet may also be used to cover the packed forage edges of the sheet may be sealed by mud plastering keep an occasional watch and if there is any crack or hole plug it immediately silage will be ready within 45 days open the silopit from one end only and take out the daily requirement of the feed the remaining silage if kept covered stays good till used a well preserved material has ph of 3545 and is low in losses of nitrogen a good quality silage almost retains the nutritional value of original crop and has a high lactic acid and a low butyric acid content feeding the silage the animals may not like its taste for the first few feedings help them to develop the taste by mixing 5 to 10 kg of silage in their green fodder ration for the first 5 to 6 days after taste development 20 to 30 kg of silage along with other fodders may be fed per head per day hay making the aim of haymaking is to reduce the moisture content of green fodder to below 15 per cent so that little or no change in nutritive value occurs during storage the fodder crops having soft stems are suitable for haymaking in legumes such as berseem lucerne and cowpea care should be taken to avoid shattering of leaves during drying nonlegumes such as maize jowar bajra are more suitable for silage making than for hay making harvest the fodder crops at preflowering stage chop the fodder to a length of 5 to 8 cm and spread it in a 1015 cm thick layer on a hardsurface to dry it in the sun the usual threshing floor can also be used for this purpose to speed up the drying process stir the fodder with a rake after every 2 to 3 hours during the day when thoroughly dried usually 23 days depending on the frequency of stirring collect the dried material for storage a practical method of determining the safe limit of moisture content for storage of dried material is to twist some of the stems if the stem breaks easily the hay is fit for storage it can be stored in a room normally used for storing wheat bhusa a kilogram of dried hay containing 90 per cent dry matter is equivalent to about 6 kilograms of green fodder containing 15 per cent dry matter1097 other crops guara guara is one of the important legume crops which is grown for different purposes such as green fodder grain green manure and vegetable it is known for its drought resistance and soil renovation qualities guara seed is used as concentrate

tubewell on the farm to have easy water availability it can be made into bundles of convenient size about 1015 kilograms prepare large quantity of a soaking solution by thoroughly mixing one kg cow dung for every 1000 litre of water in a big tank the volume of the tank can be calculated by measuring length x breadth x height of the tank in metres one cubic metre is equal to 1000 litres of water dip the bundles one by one into the soaking solution for 23 minutes drain the excess solution by placing the bundles on a slope lined with a plastic sheet the drip should be collected and recycled into the tank again make 15 cm raised beds 5 metre long and 15 metre wide on the ground this will help in assessing the exact watering of the heap later draining of water out of bed is a visual indication of excess watering take the wet ricestraw to the location of the compost heap line the bed with 26 centimetre diameter tree branchessticks this helps in aeration in the heaped ricestraw the wet rice straw will generally have 70 per cent moisture place the wet rice straw on the beds uniformly until 500 kilograms has been stacked powdered lowgrade rock phosphate low grade rock phosphate can be had from rajasthan state mines and minerals ltd 4 meera marg udaipur 313004 should be mixed 6 per cent on dry weight basis of the rice straw approximately for 500 kilogram of the rice straw 30 kg of the rock phosphate should be sprinkled uniformly while making the heap after wetting this will give approximately 1 phosphorus in the final decomposed product the height of 500 kg ricestraw stack is 15 metre approximately any quantity of ricestraw can be composted in multiple heaps of 500 kg at one time leaving a passage of 10 metre between the beds cover the heap with a 2030 centimetre thick layer of unsoaked ricestraw this will minimize water loss while providing the necessary aeration the major key to success is the ability to maintain about 70 per cent moisture in the heap any major error in this step will delay composting water the heaps using watering lance with the help of tullu pump note watering heaps with sprinklers does not work because water generally runs down the sides instead of going inside the heap ensure that the water penetrates the heap by using a lance with a sharp point to pierce the heap of ricestraw pierce the lance deepest possible with an aim to water uniformly composting can be terminated after 8090 days by which time it is ready for processing or for field application by this time its carbon and nitrogen ratio changes to 151 at this stage

gases which can be harmful to the earthworms 2 the bed must be kept under the shed to protect the earthworms from direct sunlight heat cold and heavy rains 3 the moisture in the beds must be 6070 1309 multiple cropping multiple cropping is a system in which more than two crops are grown one after the other on the same piece of land in quick succession during a year the success of this system depends upon the selection of suitable cropsvarieties availability of labour farm machinery irrigation fertilizers pesticides finance etc in addition to the required technical knowhow timely cultural operations alertness and managerial capability of the farmer are highly critical factors in the success of multiple cropping the objective is to grow one or two additional crops in between the main season crops this can be made possible through selection of short duration high yielding varieties older nursery seedlings under delayed rice transplanting adoption of minimum tillage and interrelay

ricewheat cropping system14011 soil test b ased fertilizer appli cation soil testing is the best tool to ensure optimum and balanced use of nutrients improper use of fertilizers leads not only to imbalanced nutrition but also deterioration of the environment soil testing comprises determination of organic carbon content and the amount of available nutrients besides the basic characteristics such as soil reaction ph and soil salinity electrical conductivity based on the soil test values the soils are categorized as low medium and high with respect to the status of available nutrients fertilizer recommendations are made for each category depending upon the cropcropping sequence in question general fertilizer recommendations given in the package of practices pertain to normal soils of medium category nitrogen organic carbon content of the soil is considered as an index of available nitrogen and is thus used to make fertilizer recommendations for nitrogen based on its content the soils are categorized as low less than 040 medium 040075 and high more than 075 since the soils low in organic carbon are poor in supplying nitrogen increase the dose of nitrogenous fertilizer by 25 per cent over the general recommended dose for medium organic carbon soils whereas in high organic carbon soils lower this dose by 25 per cent table 1 phosphorus based on available phosphorus content soils with less than 5 kg phosphorusacre are rated as low those with 59 kg phosphorusacre as medium with 920 kg phosphorusacre as high and with more than 20 kg phosphorusacre as very high in soils testing low in phosphorus apply 25 per cent more fertilizer than the recommended dose whereas in high phosphorus soils reduce it by 25 per cent table 1 in soils testing very high in available phosphorus omit application of phosphatic fertilizer application for 23 years and then get the soil tested to know if the repeat application of phosphorus is required however in maizewheat cropping system when soil test phosphorus level is more than 16 kgper acre there is no need to add any phosphorus fertilizer to both the crops in kharif crops eg rice maize and cotton following wheat that received the recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer omit its application in soybeanwheat rotation if recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer has been applied to wheat apply only 150 kg super phosphate instead of 200 kg per acre however in soils where wheat did not receive the recommended dose apply phosphatic fertilizer on soil test basis in sugarcane too the phosphatic fertilizer should be applied only if the soil tests low in available phosphorus141table 1 fertilizer recommendations kg per acre for major crops grown on different fertility category soils crops soil test category

also influences the amount of fertilizer phosphorus required the dose of phosphatic fertilizer should be decided based on both the soil organic carbon and available phosphorus content as shown in table 2 as such if the soil organic carbon content is 04 to 06 per cent reduce the phosphatic fertilizer dose by 25 per cent in medium phosphorus soils by 50 per cent in high phosphorus soils and omit its application in very high phosphorus soils if organic carbon content of the soil is more than 06 per cent and available phosphorus is 59 kg per acre reduce the dose by 50 per cent however if soil phosphorus status is more than 9 kg per acre omit the application of phosphatic fertilizers in all other categories viz soil with less than 5 kg phosphorusacre irrespective of organic carbon content and soils with less than 04 per cent organic carbon irrespective of soil phosphorus status apply the recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer table 2 recommendations for fertilizer phosphorus based

fertilizer dose for medium soils as given in table 1 potassium based on the available potassium status soils are grouped into two categorizes viz deficient less than 55 kg k2oacre and sufficient more than 55 kg k2oacre application of potassium is recommended only in soils deficient in available 142potassiu m since the farmers mostly omit potassium application it is important to get the soil tested in order to ensure that potassium deficiency does not limit crop yields deficiency of potassium is generally confied to the soils in the districs of gurdaspur hoshiarpur nawanshahar jalandhar and ropar micronutrients micronutrient deficiencies are becoming important yield limiting factors particularly in kharif crops due to intensive cropping cultivation of fertilizer responsive high yielding crop varieties and the use of high analysis fertilizers based on the critical deficiency levels of micronutrients the soils are categorized as deficient or adequate in respect of different micronutrients in zincdeficient soils available zinc content less than 06 kg per acre soil application of 25 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate or 16 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate per acre is recommended for rice as well as groundnut application of 10 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate or 65 kg zinc sulphate monohydrate per acre is recommended for maize and cotton in case of maize if zinc deficiency symptoms appear late in the season when interculture is not possible it is advised to spray the crop with a solution prepared by dissolving 12 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate and 600 gram of unslaked lime or 750 g zinc sulphate monohydrate and 375 gram of unslaked lime in 200 litre of water per acre since kharif crops particularly rice and maize are more susceptible to zinc deficiency application of zinc sulphate should be made preferably to kharif crop in the cropping sequence in order to get maximum benefit iron deficiency is a common problem of rice grown on highly permeable coarse textured soils and that of sugarcane on highly alkaline soils it is therefore recommended to spray the crops with 10 per cent solution of ferrous sulphate initiating at the appearance of deficiency symptoms generally 23 sprays carried out at weekly intervals are sufficient regular green manuring with dhaincha before rice transplanting also helps in reducing the occurrence of iron deficiency in the rice crop salt affected soils apart from the nutrient content the soil texture its reactionand degree of salinity or alkalinity also influence the efficiency of applied fertilizers for proper reclamation of the alkali sodic soils ph more than 93 gypsum application must be accompanied with other management practices in these soils it is recommended to apply 25 per cent higher fertilizer nitrogen over that for the normal soils crops grown on alkali soils generally show zinc deficiency and require application of zinc sulphate at rates higher than those recommended for normal soils saline soils electrical conductivity more than 08 millimhoscm require 25 per cent extra fertilizer nitrogen in these soils addition of organic manuresgreen manurescrop residues is beneficial far mers are advised not to apply gypsum to saline soils143collection of soil sample for making fertilizer recommendations in field crops scrap away surface litter and make a vshaped cut with a spade or a khurpa to a depth of 6 inches remove about 1 thick uniform slice of soil from one side of the cut similarly collect samples from 7 to 8 places in the field of uniform texture and uniform fertility put the samples in a clean bucket tray or cloth and mix it thoroughly take approximately half kg of soil in a cloth bag and label it with information such as field number name of the farmer address date of sampling etc the soil samples are usually collected from fallow fields after the harvest of crops however except for rice soil samples in other crops can also be taken during the standing crops from the area between the rows for kallar reclamation dig three feet deep pit with one side vertically straight and the other slanting from the vertically straight side remove with the help of khurpa about 1 thick soil layer to collect about half kg soil from 06 612 1224 and 2436 inch depth put the soil samples collected from each depth in a separate clean cloth bag and label with the information such as field number depth of sample name of the farmer address date of sampling etc for orchard plantation dig a 6 feet deep pit in the centre of the field with one side vertically straight and the other slanting from the vertically straight side remove with the help of khurpa about 1 thick soil layer to collect about half kg soil from 06 612 1224 2436 3648 4860 and 6072 inch depth collect and process samples from different depths as described above for kallar reclamation if there is any concretion layer sample it separately and note down its depth and width if the samples are wet dry them in shade before putting into the cloth bag soil testing laboratories soil and water samples are tested by the following laboratories in punjab 1 soil testing laboratory deptt of soil science punjab agricultural

markfed and the department of agriculture and farmer welfare punjab have also established soiltesting laboratories in the state14412 ra tional use of poor quality irrigation water in abo ut 42 of the total area of punjab the underground tubewell waters contain high concentration of salts and their sustained use adversely affects soil health and agricultural production these waters are either saline containing chlorides and sulphates of sodium or sodic containing carbonates and bicarbonates of sodium some of these waters may also contain toxic elements like boron and flouride it is therefore important that the underground tubewell waters must be got tested from a soil and water testing laboratory so as to know the kind and extent of the problem irrigation with waters having very high concentration of salts is not recommended but waters having low to moderate salinity or sodicity can be used by following specific management practices in punjab the problem is mainly due to high sodicity expressed in terms of residual sodium carbonates rsc in ground waters and the following guidelines are recommended for their safe use 1 ensure adequate drainage in areas receiving poor quality irrigation waters leaching of excess soluble salts and water from the root zone depth of the soil has to be ensured so as to maintain a favourable salt and water balance in poorly drained areas and in soils having hard pan at some depth long term irrigation with poor quality waters results in the build up of salts in the soil much more rapidly than that under well drained soil conditions provision of proper drainage is therefore a prerequisite when poor quality waters are to be used for irrigation surface drains are cheaper than the subsurface drains 2 level the land properly for uniform distribution of irrigation water in the field the land should be properly levelled proper land levelling also ensures uniform leaching of soluble salts and waters from the soil even with small changes of microrelief in the field unequal distribution of water and salts takes place 3 use poor quality waters on light textured soils these soils facilitate leaching of salts applied through irrigation water because of their high infiltration rates infiltration rates of the heavy textured soils are low and water applied through irrigation tends to stagnate at the surface for longer periods and after evaporation salinitysodicity builds up at faster rates in these soils it is therefore recommended that poor quality waters should preferably be used on light textured soils 4 make proper crop selection it is always preferable to grow crops and varieties capable of producing high yields even when irrigated with saline or sodic waters only salt tolerant and semitolerant crops like barley wheat mustard guar senji spinach turnip sugarbeet raya and millets should be grown cotton is sensitive at the germination stage but can be grown if proper germination is ensured by presowing irrigation with good quality water pulse crops are sensitive to salinity and sodicity and therefore should not be irrigated with poor quality waters the crops having high water requirements such as rice sugarcane and berseem should preferably not be grown particularly when drainage is very poor 5 apply gypsum poor permeability of soils is commonly observed where irrigation waters containing high bicarbonates of sodium testing high in rsc are used high 145saturation of the soil with sodium deteriorates soil structure and results in poor aeration and poor nutrient and water availability to plant roots the adverse effects of high soil sodium saturation can be offset by gypsum application application of gypsum is recommended when rsc of irrigation water exceeds 25 mel the quantity of gypsum should be got calculated from a soil and water testing laboratory for each mel of rsc the quantity of gypsum 70 purity works out to be 150 quintals per acre for four irrigations of 75 cm each gypsum should be applied on cumulative basis calculated on the basis of number of irrigations in one dose after the harvest of previous crop if the soil is already sodic gypsum should be applied on soil test basis after mixing gypsum in the surface 010 cm soil heavy irrigation should be given to leach down soluble salts before sowing of the next crop 6 use organic amendments in calcareous soils with more than 2 calcium carbonate use organic manures viz farmyard manure 8 tonnesacre or green manure or wheat straw 25 tonnesacreyear for reducing harmful effects of sodic irrigation water 7 irrigate alternate furrows in cotton growing areas where underground irrigation water is of poor quality prefer ridge planting of cotton using presowing irrigation with canal water and subsequent irrigations with poor quality tube well water in alternate furrows for sustainable yields the alternate furrow irrigation with poor quality tube well water also results in saving of irrigation water and check deterioration of soil health 8 use of saline water for irrigating cotton under scarcity of good quality irrigation water alternate use of good quality canal water and saline tubewell water through surface drip irrigation is recommended in lighttextured soil for obtaining sustainable seed cotton yield with a minimal adverse effect on soil quality in soils irrigated with saline water ec upto 10 dsm application of 16 quintal per acre riceresidue biochar reduces adverse affect of salinity and increases seed cotton yield 9 use poor and good waters conjunctively this practice assumes importance particularly when supplies of good quality canal water are inadequate the poor quality waters should preferably be used to supplement the good quality canal waters the poor and good quality waters can be used together either alternatively or by mixing with each other it is also advisable to use good quality waters in early stages of crop growth and poor quality waters during later stages when the crop can tolerate higher salinitysodicity levels 10 watch the build up of the salinity and sodicity in the soil when poor quality waters are used on a long term basis the farmers should keep a watch on the build up of salts in the soil by getting the soil samples tested at regular intervals this will help them in keeping a check on soil deterioration 11 use of village pond water for irrigation water in village ponds contains essential plant nutrients like nitrogen phosphorus and potassium however it may also contain salts such as carbonates bicarbonates and chlorides of calcium magnesium sodium and pathogenic microorganisms in undesirable amounts therefore this water should be got tested from the soil and water testing laboratory department of soil science for physiochemical parameters and from department of microbiology for microbiological quality after that watermay be used for irrigation as per recommendation14613 spray technology the success of insectpests diseases and weed control depends upon use of proper spraying technology adopt following recommendations for efficient and effective management of weeds insectpests and diseases selection of pesticide correct identification of insectpest disease and weed is very essential for proper selection of pesticides always use the recommended brand of herbicide pesticide and fungicide selection of spray pump and nozzle spraying of pesticides can be done with knapsack sprayer manually or battery operated or tractor operated sprayer see appendix v for spray of preemergence herbicides at the time of sowing use flat fan or flood jet nozzles always use flat fan nozzles for spraying post emergence herbicides use cone type nozzle for the control of insectpests and diseases quantity of water always use 200 litres of water for preemergence herbicides at the time of sowing and 150 litres of water per acre for post emergence application use 200 litres of water for control of diseases and 100150 litres of water per acre for control of insect pests to estimate the water required for spraying fill the spray pump with measured quantity of water and spray in the field after spraying measure the area sprayed and calculates the required quantity of water per acre by the following formula v olume of water consumed litre x 4000 quantity of water lacre sprayed area m2 preparation of spray fluid according to the quantity of water needed for an acre as calculated above calculate the number of spray pumps required for spraying one acre for example if water required for spraying in one acre is 150 litres and capacity of spray pump is 15 litre it means 10 pumps are required for spraying one acre area in this case dissolve the quantity of pesticide required for one acre in less quantity of water and make the volume to 10 litre now pour one litre of this pesticide solution in one spray pump for tractor operated sprayer prepare the pesticides solution as per the capacity of spray tank method of spray nozzle height at the time of spraying is very important maintain nozzle height around 15 feet from the crop canopy during spraying of herbicides insecticides and fungicides on the crop similarly in case of preemergence herbicides maintain the nozzle height at 15 feet from ground surface always spray in strips by keeping the spray lance straight do not move the spray lance to and fro use multiboom nozzles for uniform spray in case of backpack type electrostatic sprayer electrostatic nozzle should not be lifted above the shoulder height maintain the distance of the electrostatic nozzle tip about 1 to 15 feet above the crop canopy only 15 litres of water per acre is required for spraying with electrostatic sprayer147precautions during spraying always purchase recommended brands of pesticides and obtain bill from the shopkeeper read carefully instructions given on pesticide label and follow the same clean the spray pump with washing sodasurf solution before and after spray if possible keep separate pumps for spraying herbicide and other pesticides do not tear open the pesticide packet but use scissor or knife for this purpose use recommended dose of pesticides and apply at appropriate time the preparation of spray solutions from concentrated pesticides should be done in drums using long sticks to protect the operation from splashings and to permit stirring from a standing position always use clean water for spraying to avoid clogging in the nozzles wear hand gloves for preparation of spray fluid and gas mask full sleeve shirt and trousers during spraying only healthy person without any wound on body should be engaged for spraying do not spray on an empty stomach never spray accross the direction of the wind flow spray should be done on calm days do not blow the clogged nozzle if nozzle clogs remove and disassemble the nozzle assembly clean the openingsfilter and nozzle tips of any obstructions and reassemble if the discharge rate of the nozzle exceeds by 1015 than the initial discharge rate the nozzle is considered as worn out replace the worn out nozzle do not touch the nozzle tip while operating the backpack type airassisted electrostatic sprayer operator should not work for more than 8 hours a day those engaged in handling pesticides should be checked by a physician regularly the worker should not smoke chew eat or drink while spraying and must wash hands and feet thoroughly with soap and water after handling or use of pesticide keep pesticides in labelled containers only store pesticides in a safe and locked place out of the reach of children irresponsible persons and pets never store pesticides near foodstuffs or medicines do not use the empty containers of pesticides for any purpose destroy them by making holes14814 management of rodents an d birds a management of rodents rats and mice are the most serious pests of crops and must be controlled by virtue of their extremely adaptable nature highly intelligent patterns of behaviour and tremendous potential to multiply they maintain their large populations which cause extensive damage in crop fields and other premises they cause more damage at seedling and ripening stages of the crops the performance of different control methods vary in different situations and at different stages of the crop the best control success can only be achieved if these methods are adopted properly at appropriate timings methods of control i mechanical control killing during irrigation of vacant harvested fields rats coming out of flooded burrows may be killed with sticks trapping in crop fields place 16 trapsacre covering runways damage and activity sites of rodents in houses godowns poultry farms etc set traps 1 trap48 m2 area along the walls in corners behind the storage bins and boxes etc kill the trapped rats by drowning in water and the interval between two trappings at the same location should not be less than 30 days do not place the traps at the same place again and again ii cultural control weeds grasses and bushes should be removed from the fields as these provide shelter and food to rats and mice highly infested bunds water channels and field pavements should be periodically rebuilt to destroy permanent rat burrows keep the height and width of bunds to minimum and avoid crop lodging iii biological control owls kites hawks falcons eagles snakes monitor lizards cats mongoose etc are the natural predators of rats and mice these should be protected iv chemical control poison bait preparation the acceptance of poison baits by rats and mice depends upon the quality texture taste and odour of the baiting materials therefore bait should be prepared as under zinc phosphide bait 2 take 1 kg of bajra or sorghum or cracked wheat or their mixture and mix it thoroughly with 20 g of edible vegetable oil 20 g of powdered sugar and 25 g of 80 zinc phosphide powder caution never allow water to mix in zinc phosphide bait and always use freshly prepared bait minimum interval between two baitings of zinc phosphide must be 2 months to increase the acceptance and efficacy of zinc phosphide bait do prebaiting for this place bajra or sorghum or cracked wheat or their mixture smeared 149with oil and powdered sugar 400g per acre at 40 bait points on pieces of paper for 23 days bromadiolone bait 0005 take 1 kg of bajra or sorghum or cracked wheat or their mixture or flour and mix it thoroughly with 20 g of edible vegetable oil 20 g of powdered sugar and 20 g of 025 bromadiolone powder poison bait placement and timings baiting in lean period mayjune this period is most suitable for rodent control campaign in large areas during this period the rat burrows can easily be located in the fields on bunds water channels and surrounding waste lands close all the burrows in the evening and in the reopened burrows on the next day insert a paper boat containing about 10 g of zinc phosphide or bromadiolone bait about 6 inches deep in each burrow in case of burrows of the lesser bandicoot rat gently remove the fresh soil from the burrow opening to locate the tunnel and then put the poison bait deep inside it baiting in different crops for baiting in crop fields keep 1010 g of poison bait on pieces of paper at 40 bait points per acre on dry sites and inside the crop throughout the field along bunds covering runways and activity sites of rodents paddy do poison baiting in the month of augustseptember using 400 g per acre zinc phosphide or bromadiolone bait the baiting must be done during dry days and before milky grain stage otherwise if delayed the rats would avoid poison bait due to the availability of fresh grains in the crop sugarcane since sugarcane crop harbours high rodent population poison baiting should be done first in july after paddy transplantation and second in octobernovember after paddy harvest at each of these two timings do baiting with zinc phosphide or bromadiolone followed by another baiting after 15 days with bromadiolone 400 g per acre each if the crop is to be harvested after januaryfebruary third baiting should be done with bromadiolone 800 g per acre on 40 bait papers in january groundnut do double rodenticidal baiting with 2 zinc phosphide bait followed by bait of 0005 bromadiolone bait or viceversa 400 g per acre each the first baiting should be done at the start of pod formation when the crop is of 6065 days the second baiting should be done after an interval of one month ie before the maturation of pods 9095 days of crop note in crop fields the rodenticide baiting should be done when the number of live rodent burrows is more than 10acre safety measures keep the rodenticides and poison baits away from reach of children domestic animals and pets mixing of rodenticides in the baiting material should be done with a stick spade or by wearing gloves avoid contact of poison with mouth nose and eyes household utensils should never be used for preparation of the poison bait collect and burry the left over poison bait and dead rats zinc phosphide is toxic and there is no antidote for it in case of its accidental ingestion induce vomiting by inserting fingers in the throat and rush to a doctor 150 vitamin k is the antidote for bromadiolone which can be given to the patient under medical supervision v integrated approach no single method is 100 effective in controlling rats and mice left over population reproduce reaching the orginal size in a short time therefore adopt an integrated approach by using different methods at different stages of the crop after harvesting rabi crops rats must be killed during irrigation and apply chemical measures at appropriate timings in the crop as given above the left over rats after zinc phosphide baiting should be tackled with bromadiolone due to bait shyness zinc phosphide cannot be used in follow up baiting but bromadiolone can be used do not repeat zinc phosphide bait before two months village level campaign control of rats and mice in smaller areas usually becomes ineffective due to their migration from the surrounding untreated fields therefore for better results village level antirat campaigns to cover maximum possible area both cultivated and uncultivated should be organized rodent proof storage structure for rodent proofing of cover and plinth cap storage structure under outdoor bulk grain storage conditions built plinth at a height of 25 feet from ground level and extend platform by one foot in all the four sides of a plinth b management of birds birds in general are both useful and harmful to agriculture even the same species may be beneficial or problematic in different situations only a few of about 300 species of birds of punjab cause problems in crop fields and granaries roseringed parakeet is the only bird that seems to be exclusively harmful to farmers interests harmful birds parakeet is the major bird pest causing serious damage to almost all cereal and fruit crops it is particularly harmful to sunflower house crows damage sprouting wheat maize and sunflower house crows also damage maturing maize and sunflower doves and pigeons damage pulses sparrow and weaver birds damage stored grains at shellers and godowns sparrows and weaver birds also damage rice nurseries and maturing bajra and sorghum management techniques for harmful birds i mechanical control use crackers to scare the birds at different intervals fixing of scare crows ie a discarded earthen pot painted to stimulate human like head supported with wooden sticks and clothed in human dress to give a human like appearance is one of the most effective traditional techniques to keep the birds away position direction and the dress of the scare crow should be changed at least at 10 days interval the height of the scare crow should be 1 meter above from the crop height use automatic bird scarers by shifting their position periodically the other simplest method is the use of rope crackers it involves tying of sets of small fire crackers at a distance of 68 inches apart and igniting it from the lower end the explosions caused 151by the fire crackers on catching fire at different intervals scare the birds feeding on sproutings fix up the rope crackers in the centre of the field during sprouting stage whereas in maturing crops fix the rope on a stick in the periphery of the field to reduce bird damage to maize reflective ribbons of polyester strips with metallic coating of red color on one side and silver on the other having 15 cm width should be used reflective ribbons should be installed about 30 cm above the crop canopy in parallel rows at 5 m distance in northsouth direction at the milky stage of the crop if there are resting sites for birds nearby the fields then one strip of reflective ribbon should also be installed on the boundary of the field reflective ribbons for bird scaring is an effective easy to use and ecofriendly technique for bird management in maize crop ii cultural practices the traditional practices of planting 23 border rows of less costly crops like millet maize and daincha equally preferred by birds will reduce the bird pressure to the inside sown cash crops particularly sunflower and maize etc moreover planting of these crops also act as physical barriers wind breakers and help in preventing lodging of crops during stormyrainy days as far as possible sowing of maize and sunflower crop should be avoided at sites most frequently visited by birds or where there are more resting sites like trees electric wires buildings etc to prevent parakeet damage in sunflower and maize crops sowing should be discouraged in small block areas at least 23 acre block area is more suitable for lessening bird damage pressure because parakeet avoid feeding venturing in the core of the field iii alarming calls playing of cd available with centre of communication and international linkages pau of distress or flock calls of parakeets and crows respectively at peak volume for hr twice each in the morning between 700 to 900 am and in the evening at 500 to 700 pm respectively with a pause of 1 hour scare the birds or halt their activities for full day in the freshly sown emerging or maturing crop fields and in orchards use of distress or flock calls remain effective for 1520 days better result can be obtained by using this technique in sequence or in combination with other methods as an integrated pest management for covering larger area use of amplifier and additional speakers as per requirement can be done conservation of useful birds predatory birds like owls falcons hawks eagles kites etc eat large number of rats and mice a single owl normally eats 45 rats a day insect eating birds like drongo babblers shrikes lapwings mynas and many other small birds eat away numerous insect pests even granivorous birds like sparrows and weaver birds feed a large number of insects to their young ones a single pair of house sparrows feed insects to their young ones about 250 times a day therefore the useful birds should not be killed rather they can be attracted to crop fields in several different ways152annexure i minimum support prices of different crops rs per quintal cropcrop year 201920 202021 202122 202223 202324 paddy common 1815

standards are in percentage unless indicated otherwise f foundation c certified cercospora leaf spot diseaseannexure iv b field standards for the production of foundation and certified seeds161annexure v agricultural engineering i recommendations for implementsmachines general recommendations in respect of implements and machines used in agriculture are given below the selection of the implements or machinery should be made on the basis of size and draft requirements which should match with the power available on the farm design field capacity materials availability of spare parts and cost of operation per hour or per acre are important criteria to be considered in order to arrive at the decision to own a machine or any implement implements and machines including tractor involve a lot of investment periodic maintenance before and after the use of machinery is therefore very necessary in most cases owners manuals will provides safe guidelines on following these guidelines machinery is expected to give uninterrupted service throughout its life the seedcumfertilizer drill and the tractor mounted sprayer should be calibrated before they are used safety rules must be followed and adhered to strictly while operating tractors and high speed agricultural machinery to avoid the loss of life and property seedcumfertilizer drill in selecting a seedcumfertilizer drill the following points should be considered it must have provision for varying linetoline distance the machine must have provision to control the depth of seed placement the metering system of the drill should not damage the seeds which pass through the system all furrow openers must deliver the same quantity of seed and fertilizer a good agitator in the fertilizer box is desirable to avoid bridging there should be provision for disengaging the seed and fertilizer distribution system for proper selection of seedcumfertilizer drills the test reports issued by the farm machinery testing centre of the punjab agricultural university must be considered calibration of drill calibration means such a setting of the metering mechanism that ensures the dropping of the right quantity of seed and fertilizer in the field the drills are already calibrated by the manufacturers but the calibration may become defective during transportation further the same calibration may not be found appropriate for all varieties of seed the method of calibration is given below jackup the seedcumfertilizer drill and check the free rotation of the driving wheel and the grain and fertilizer feedshafts place the co ntainer or bag under each seed tube measure the circumference of the wheel the circumference gives the distance covered in one revolution of the wheel162 find out the size of the drill by multiplying the number of furrowopeners by the distance between the furrow openers find out the number of revolutions required to sow one acre area as follows area of an acre 4000 sq m number of revolutions size of drill m x circumference of wheel m multiply this figure by 910 to take care of the wheelslippage in the field mark a point on the rim of the wheel rotate the wheel by 110th of the number of revolutions required to sow one acre as above collect the seed quantity from each container separately and weigh for getting seed rate per acre multiply by 10 if the quantity collected from each container is not uniform then check for a defect in the seeddropping mechanism adjust the shiftlever on the feed box for grain rate accordingly ie if the seed rate seems to be less than the actual quantity required per acre and then move the indicator a little to the higher side and viceversa repeat this process twice to get the correct setting of the seed rate calibrate in the same manner for fertilizer rate weight of seeds dropped in five revolutions of ground wheel for each seed tube of seedcumfertilizer drill distance between rows size of wheel 45 cm18 60 cm24 75 cm30 90

basis from the other agencies there have been reports that in several instances the combine did a poor job resulting in considerable loss of grain the loss of grains as loose grains or ear heads can occur at the following points in a combine i at the cutter bar these losses can be seen on the ground if all the discharge from behind the machine is collected in a bag and then the machine performance is observed for some distance these can be avoided or reduced by setting the proper height of cutterbar reel and forw ard speed ii behind the machine these losses will be either in the form of unthreshed heads or loose grains too many unthreshed heads mean that the cylinderspeed and the cylinder concave clearance are not properly adjusted too many loose grains may be due to many chocked sieves or excessive air blasts or both proper machine adjustment including running at speed according to the plant density can reduce such losses iii grain delivery unclean grain or broken grain or both will result from excessive cylinder speed or improper sievechaffer setting or improper forward speed163combine is very sensitive to adjustments which are required to be made at turning or according to the varying plant density crop conditions lodged etc and ground level bunds etc to get a rough estimate of losses measure one metre square area and collect the grain and loose material fallen on it behind a combine separate the grains and weigh in grams multiply this by 10 to get the loss in kilograms per hectare alternatively estimate the loss by counting the number of grains collected from one square metre area one hundred grains per sq metre mean about 40 kg per hectare for wheat tips for efficient use of combine for paddy harvesting paddy should be harvested between 900 am to 900 pm due to fogdew and excessive moisture in air selfpropelled combine should be operated between 25 to 35 kmh whereas tractor operated combine should be operated between 20 to 30 kmh depending upon the field condition further in case of lodged crop the maximum speeds are 25 and 15 kmh for selfpropelled and tractor operated combines respectively paddy should be harvested below 22 moisture replace cutter bar blades if it has become blunt reduce airblast if grain damage as thrower losses is above 1 if still the problem persists open the chaff sieve further if grain breakage is more than 2 in the grain tank then reduce cylinder speed or increase concave clearance at the rear if the amount of unthreshed grain in the thrower loss is more than 1 then reduce the cylinder concave clearance if combine gets overloaded then reduce the forward speed or cut the crop little higher if crop is wet ie more than 22 percent grain moisture then it should not be harvested otherwise it can cause fire guidelines for adjusting the combine for maize threshing with husk the drive to the cutter bar should be disconnected and the reel should be removed for easier feeding of the maize ears this can be done very easily by removing a belt and opening only a few nuts and bolts arrangements should be made to put the maize ears at a distance from the auger and allow these ears to flow by gravity directly to the auger this will make the feeding proper and safe the feeding platform should be lifted about one foot above ground for proper feeding raspbar cylinder used for threshing wheat should be used for threshing maize the speed of cylinder should be kept between 500 to 600 rpm as compared to about 900 rpms for wheat this could be achieved by mounting a 12 inches pulley on the cylinder shaft and 6 inches pulley on the drive shaft stripping beater shaft cylinderconcave clearance should be maximum approx one inch for maize threshing this could be achieved by setting concaveshaft on one of the last three notches the sieve in the cleaning shoe should be replaced by the large hole size sieve approx 12 inch generally provided with the combine by manufacturers164 if the combine does not have a grain tank the grains should directly by taken from the chaffer to avoid possible grain damage however if a grain tank is provided no such change is necessary there should be least two canvas screens on the strawrackwalkers one screen is normally provided at 13rd distance in the first portion the second screen should be provided at 13rd distance from the rear this is necessary to avoid grain losses effective utilization of threshers presentl y about 300000 threshers are being used for threshing of wheat crop in the punjab in order to utilize these threshers efficiently and economically the following points are to be kept in mind the farmers decision on owning a particular type of thresher should be based upon output of threshed crop in quintals per horsepowerhour speed of the threshing cylinder in rpm recommended by the manufacturer power required to operate the thresher this information should be gathered from the manufacturer and check with the test report from the farm machinery testing centre department of farm machinery and power engineering pau ludhiana if available with the abovementioned information in hand the farmer will be able to use his thresher economically and efficiently provided the following guidelines are observed the thresher should be kept in level position the power required by the thresher should match with that of the power source which should not be overloaded it should be operated at the recommended rpm with due adjustment made in the thresher for the crop variety moisture content and cleanliness of the grain tips to save diesel badly maintained tractor wastes upto 25 per cent of the diesel used prevent leakage of diesel as it is a direct wastage wrong gear selection can increase fuel consumption upto 30 per cent and reduce output upto 50 per cent a smoky tractor wastes diesel upto 20 per cent unfiltered air wears out cylinder bore 45 times faster and piston rings 115 times faster than normal which results in loss of power and wastage of diesel avoid unnecessary slippage of tractor wheels with the help of water ballast andor cast iron weights in case of sandy soils and use cage wheel in wet land condition to avoid slippage relug worn out tyres operate the tractor at the correct throttle setting to give the recommended pto speed for operating pumping set or thresher keep the correct

irrigation in punjab they are centrifugal pumps propeller pumps turbine pumps and submersible pumps centrifugal pumps are widely used in pumping water they are simple in construction easy to operate low in intial cost and produce a constant steady discharge generally they are used to lift water for a total head of 4 meters to 10 meters propeller pump is used for low head generally less than 4 meters it is used for lifting water from water course drain pond river etc it is also relatively simple in fabrication care and repair when the depth of water table is more than the practical reach of centrifugal pump or the water table is fluctuating then submersible pump or turbine pump is used both turbine pumps as well as submersible pumps have high initial cost difficult to install and difficult to repair as compard to centrifugal pumps a selection total head and discharge expected from the pump to irrigate a particular area is calculated and then the pump is selected which has the best efficiency at the above head and discharge conditions reputed pump manufacturers furnish the characteristic curves or catalogues giving summary of important characteristics of their pumps pumps made by different manufacturers may vary considerably in their prices adaptibility and efficiency the pumps have efficiencies from 50 to 70 per cent good pumps with the highest possible efficiency should therefore be chosen regarding efficiency isi and punjab quality mark pump can be relied upon while purchasing the pump the farmer should have the following information source of water supply open well tubewell canal etc water table depth in the area crops to be sown total area under crops discharge required170 type of primemover engine or motor in case of electric motor the hours of electric supply location of tubewell in the farm type of drive belt drive direct coupled monoblock water conveyance system lined or unlined or underground pipeline ground water quality in the area b instructions for efficient use of pumps the centrifungal pump should be installed at 1 to 2 m above the water level select a proper pump by consulting the different performance tables or charts from the dealer use large radius bends keep the height of delivery pipe at the minimum possible height above the ground level a use proper material of joint dori b fix joint dori in such a way that it leaks about 1520 drops per minute c put the joint dori in pieces equal to circumference of pump shaft the ends of each piece should be staggered servicing and annual overhauling of the pump set should be done as per manufacturers instructions to avoid leakage in joints tighten the joints properly using good quality gaskets the pump must be run at the recommended revolutions use proper quality of driving belts in case of belt driven pumps use proper size of suction and delivery pipes according to discharge use good quality reflax valve whose flap should open fully foundation should be pucca levelled and with bolts embedded in it align the motor and pump pulley accurately c gas problem in tubewell pits in some areas accummulation of gas mainly carbon dioxide gas has been found in the lower portion of the tubewell pit when one goes into the pit for repair of pump he feels difficulty in respiration and becomes unconscious after a few minutes if one experiences such conditions he should immediately come out of the pit for testing the gas one can burn a kerosene lamp and slowly lower it in the pit wherever it blows off means that below that point there is carbon dioxide gas this can be removed by using the following measures one can use an exhaust fan lowered up to bottom of the pit and keep the exhaust fan on the ground surface and attach a pvc pipe up to bottom of it171 one can use an empty juite bag or bucket or umbrella and move it up and down in the pit to remove the gas if the pump is loaded by belt run the pump idle for 15 minutes and the gas is pushed out after using these measures one should retest the gas accumulation with the kerosene lamp before going down in the pit for repairs etc d efficient use of irrigation water methods of irrigation are flooding kiara furrow sprinkler and drip method flooding kiara method is most commonly used by the farmers for irrigating cereal crops for proper utilisation of irrigation water it is necessary that most water applied in the field should be stored in the root zone of the crop this depends upon soil type field slope field size discha rge and crop to have better use of applied water irrigation method should be properly selected at present irrigation application efficiency is 30 to 40 which can be increased to 60 to 70 by adopting proper method of irrigation furrow method of irrigation is suitable for sunflower maize soybean and sugarcane crop in all types of soils sprinkler method can be used on sand dunes light soils and where water is scarce however the system has high initial cost drip method is suitable for row crops like cotton sugarcane etc on light soils poor quality water and undulating lands but the initial cost is quite high for light medium and heavy soils the recommended slopes are 04 03 and 015 per cent respectively ie the difference in levels at the two ends of an acre field should be 96 72 and 36 inches respectively further for tubewell delivery size of 34 7510 litres per sec and 6 20 litres per sec the number of border strips kiara per acre should be 16 10 8 and 10 5 4 respectively for light medium and heavy soils for mogha discharge of 30 litres per sec the number of border strips kiara per acre should be 7 4 3 respectively for light medium and heavy soils e laser land leveling laser land le veling is one such important technology for using water efficiently as it reduces irrigation time and enhances productivity not only of water but also of other nonwater farm inputs laser leveler is trailed type equipment used for achieving precise fine leveling with desired grade this two meter wide automatic leveling operation can be successfully operated with 50 or above horse powered tractor it has four basic units viz laser emittertransmitting unit laser receiving unit with soil bucket having double actuating hydraulic valve and level control box the laser beam signal with 360 laser reference upto a command radius of 300400 m for autoguidance of the receiving unit this unit actuates the hydraulic control for moving updown the leveling bucket for the desired cutfill operation prior to operating the machine the area requiring fine leveling has to be surveyed using a grade rod then based on the survey observations a mean grade is found the bucket blade is then placed at the average grade and synchronized with the control unit after this the operator operates the machine and the necessary cuts and fills are automatically controlled by the machine to achieve the desired level in the field the capacity of the machine depends 172upon the amount of soil cut and fill required in the field and field geometry it has been observed that the field efficiency of the machine is more for regular sized fields it generally takes 1525 hacre if the mean cut and fill is within 8 to 10 cm since the initial cost of the laser leveler is quite high so this type of service should be available on custom hiring through govt agencies cooperative societies and custom operatorscontractors for making this service available to all categories of farmers this technology is proven a boon to farmer community and for state agriculture and will motivate other farmers for adopting proper water management measures to use water more efficiently and judiciously thus saving the deple ting natural resource water iii turmeric washing and polishing machine turmeric rhizomes can be mechanically washed as well as polished in a portable electric power 1 hp operated rotary drum type turmeric washing and polishing machine the rotating drum made of stainless steel is provided with an electronic device to regulate precisely the rotational speed of the drum the machine operated at 40 rpm for 5 minutes can wash 2530 qh of turmeric rhizomes the same machine can be used to polish 1 qh of turmeric by increasing abrasiveness using three detachable abrasive screens along the inner side of the drum the desirable olive yellow colour of turmeric having smooth surface and negligible microbial infestation can be achieved by polishing turmeric at 40 rpm for 20 minutes only one person is required to operate the machine for more

home consumption improved storage structures of various capacities are now available for indoor use pau metal bins of 16 35 75 10 and 15 quintal capacity are available the airtight bin is so constructed that it does not allow entry of any outside insects and rodents and the insects present in the grain do not get favourable atmosphere to develop it is also economical portable and simple to fabricate for filling and using the pau metal bin the following storage practices are recommended i clean the bin thoroughly and do not allow the leftovers of the previouslystored grains to remain in the bin inspect the covers to ensure that the gaskets are intact ii clean and sort the grains of all impurities broken kernels and other impurities lead to insect attraction and hence should be separated iii do not mix the new grains with old stock as the latter may be infested with insects iv never store infested grains or grains with high moisture content dry the grains out in the sun cool it and fill in the bin later in the evening the moisture content of the grains should not be higher than 9 per cent v fillin the bin to full capacity and tight the lid properly vi do not open the bin for the first 30 days and thereafter open it fortnightly the cover should be replaced immediately after use vii inspect the grains frequently b commercial purposes for storing wheat for commercial

accidents preventive and curative measures 1 firstaid precautions during spraying accidents in case of pesticide poisoning call a physician immediately awaiting the physicians arrival apply the firstaid a swallowed poisons remove poison from the patients stomach immediately by inducing vomitting give one teaspoonful 15 g common salt in a glass of warm water emetic and repeat until the vomit fluid is clear gentle stroking or touching the throat with a finger or placing the blunt end of a spoon will help induce vomitting when the stomach is full of fluid if the patient is already vomitting do not give common salt do not induce vomitting if the patient is in a coma b inhaled poisons carry the patient do not let him walk to fresh air immediately open all doors and windows loosen all tight clothing apply artificial respiration if breathing has stopped or is irregular avoid vigorous application of pressure to the chest cover the patient with a blanket keep the patient as quiet as possible if the patient is convulsing keep him in bed in some dark room avoid any jarring noise do not give alcohol in any form c skin contamination drench the skin with water giving shower with a hose or pump apply a stream of water to the skin while removing the clothing cleanse the skin thoroughly with soap and water rapid washing is most important for reducing the extent of injury d prevention of collapse cover the patient with a light blanket raise the feet of the patient on the bed apply elastic bands to arms and legs give strong tea or coffee give fluid administration of normal saline intravenously give blood or plasma transfusion178e eye contamination hold eyelids open wash the eyes gently with stream of running water immediatelya delay of even a few seconds greatly increases the extent of injury continue washing until the physician arrives do not use chemicals they may increase the extent of the injury 2 snake bite pre ventions in snake infested regions long trousers high shoes or leggings and gloves should be worn most important is to look where one steps while walking first aid reassurance and complete rest to the victim to retard the absorption of venom a wide tournaquet or any piece of cloth should be placed a few centimeters above the site of bite it should be tight to an extent that a finger should pass below it with difficulty suction of venom should be done by giving a 1 cm linear and 12 cm deep incision at the mark of the fangs after applying an antiseptic lotion suction should preferably be done with rubber bulb breast pump or with
