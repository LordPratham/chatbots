demonstrated robust resilience during the covid 19 pandemic registering positive growth during that period and the majority of the countrys population remains directly or indirectly dependent on the sector ample evidence suggests that sustainable and inclusive agricultural growth is best supported by investment in research and that research managers and policymakers should have a clear and sustained overview of the sector in order to optimally design and adjust interventions with this in mind during a meeting with distinguished fellows of the academy we recognised the need for an annual report on the state of indian agriculture duly encouraged by the fellows and executive members of the national academy of agricultural sciences we embarked on this journey this document intends to highlight the impediments and challenges within the sector with the aim of finding the most effective path toward inclusive agricultural growth we acknowledge the need for more indepth studies and analysis however we feel that the issues and recommendations emerging from this publication can foster a better understanding of the complexities inherent in indian agriculture we feel that this improved understanding can contribute to alignment within the policy and research framework and milieu we believe that this will in turn improve efficiency help ensure equity and sustainability and address indias concerns regarding food and livelihood security at the national regional and household levels we thank all the resource persons reviewers and fellows of the national academy of agricultural sciences naas who helped us decide on the structure and contents of the paper and commenting on a draft version of it we received significant input from dr seema bathla dr raka saxena dr

union territory wpi wholesale price indexstate of indian agriculture 1in 2022 india celebrated 75 years of independence from the british raj this marked a watershed moment in the countrys history the beginning of its amrit kaal or golden era the quarter century during which it resolves to transform itself into a developed nation in november of 2023 india concluded its oneyear term as president of the g20 a year that was imbued with the spirit of vasudhaiva kutumbakam one earth one family one future and during which green inclusive and resilient growth was endorsed as a priority tremendous geopolitical turmoil and natural calamities in recent years have led to supply shocks slowdown in growth and high inflation in several countries india during this period demonstrated remarkable resilience toward these uncertainties the countrys growth story has assumed a structurally more robust trajectory it has geared up to turn domestic and international challenges into opportunities preparing a blueprint to steer the economy toward a golden era india has regained its position as the fastest growing large economy in the world in fiscal year fy 202223 the gross domestic product gdp grew by 72 percent in real terms a favourable policy environment and greater focus on capital expenditure together have resulted in a robust growth of 114 percent in the investmenttogdp ratio the share of capital expenditure in gdp synonymous with capital formation is high at 34 percent increased investments in the infrastructure technology manufacturing and agricultural sectors have created the muchneeded momentum for faster and sustainable growth the increase in capital expenditure by 374 percent over fy202122envisioned in the union budget fy202223 will further boost investment and ensure long term economic growth these and many more initiatives have laid the groundwork for faster and more inclusive growth better institutions and governance and enhanced social welfare it goes without saying that the agricultural sector contributes significantly to indias socioeconomic growth and development pathak et al 2022 introduction 2 introductionbeing a principal source of income and livelihood for half the countrys population agriculture can help india achieve a developed nation status significant transformations are taking place within the food system these range from shifts of traditional farming methods to modern capital intensive systems enabled by digital farm services to the use of artificial intelligence and drone technology efforts have also been made to link farmers directly with markets in order to help them better assess changing consumer food preferences while moving to a higher growth trajectory agriculture faces numerous domestic and international challenges these include increasingly erratic rainfall heat waves the need to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions degradation of water and soil high volatility in yield and commodity prices a surge in imports global slowdowns and increased international conflicts such as that between russia and ukraine and in palestine it is against this backdrop that the national academy of agricultural sciences naas offers this report which intends to delve into the state of indian agriculture its broad aim is to consider institutional technological and digital interventions in terms of the efficacy with which they augment farmers productivity and income naas has entered its 33rd year as a leading and successful science academy that is dedicated to the service of indian agriculture through scientific and policyoriented interventions taking stock of the progress that has been made on various fronts in agriculture will be helpful to the academy in suggesting appropriate policies for a faster and more sustainable transformation of agriculture the following is the structure of the report sections 1 and 2 discuss the achievements of the agricultural sector in terms of output growth at the allindia level and across the states input use patterns farmers income and agricultural trade it also analyses the changes in the structure and composition of agricultural output and the implications of those changes for the future of indian agriculture section 3 highlights the farmers access to institutional finance agrimarkets and key agricultural schemes section 4 brings forth pertinent issues relating to climate change and section 5 highlights the technological developments in the indian agriculture sector the final section suggests a way forward for agriculture during the amrit kaalstate of indian agriculture 311 contribution of agriculture to gdp and employment according to the theory of economic development as an economy progresses the contribution of agriculture to gdp and employment declines and that of the industrial and tertiary service sectors increases in 195051 69 percent of indias total workforce was engaged in agriculture contributing 53 percent to the national income over the years while the share of agriculture has declined in terms of both national income and employment the reduction in employment share has not kept pace with the decline in its share of total income at the allindia level in triennium ending te 2022 for instance the share of agriculture in total employment was 448 percent while its share of gdp stood at 192 percent as of fy 202223 indias inr 297 trillion about us 37 trillion economy included 182 percent contributed by the agricultural and allied sectors 252 percent by industry and 566 percent by the service sector over the long term the share of industrial gdp in total gdp has hovered around 2530 percent despite a favourable policy and incentive structure the current 182 percent contribution by agriculture to total gva reflects its sizeable decline in response to growth in the share contributed by the services sector however it seems that neither the industry nor the service sector has been able to pull people out of agriculture as 45 percent of indias 520millionperson labour force continues to be employed in agriculture though agricultural income is estimated to be inr 46 trillion about us 06 trillion and is growing low levels of labour productivity result from the large numbers of people dependent on it figure 1 this mismatch in income and employment shares may also indicate a neglect of agriculture in the existing economic development model which in performance of indian agriculture1 4 performance of indian agricultureturn has caused large disparities in income between the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors this suggests an urgent need to recognise the importance of agriculture by among other things improving land and labour productivity and creating offfarm jobs the share of agriculture and its allied sectors in the gross state domestic product gsdp exhibits stark variations across the states figure 2 at the allindia level agricultural gross value added gva constitutes a 144 percent share of gdp among the states it varies from a meagre 33 percent share in puducherry to a 333 percent share in arunachal pradesh a higher share indicates a more significant contribution of agriculture to statelevel economic output and a slower pace of growth in the industrial and services sectors madhya pradesh follows closely on arunachal pradesh at 312 percent which indicates the prominence of the agricultural sector in that states economy andhra pradesh rajasthan and tripura also exhibit noteworthy percentage shares at 287 percent 261 percent and 229 percent respectively agriculture maintains a substantial share of 212 percent in both punjab and uttar pradesh which emphasises the continued importance of agriculture in their respective economies other states such as bihar 195 percent

agriculture is on a high growth trajectory one of the factors that has contributed to higher income growth is diversification toward allied activities at the time of independence the crop sector

performance of indian agricultureinterventions to enhance coverage and effectively mitigate risks are thus necessary at the same time the landscape of registered farm organisations reflects the stark reality that only a tiny percentage of agricultural households are members of such organisations this underscores a potential gap in collective empowerment and collaborative initiatives and signals the need for strategies that enhance farmers participation in such organisations so as to foster a sense of community and amplify their collective voice the involvement of marginal and small landholders in initiatives such as the soil health card scheme and animal health card scheme is also notably limited these programmes are designed to empower farmers by providing crucial information and resources they thus need to be more inclusive and to ensure that smallholders have access to vital tools for optimising soil and animal health bridging these participation gaps is integral to realising the comprehensive benefits of these schemes across all tiers of the agricultural community the potential industrialisation of rural areas hinges on prioritising labour intensive agrobased

competitiveness will be pivotal for leveraging the full potential of its agricultural prowess on the international stage on the import front a substantial 72 percent of indias agricultural imports in 2023 are in the categories of edible oils pulses and fresh and dried fruits the escalating import of edible oils stands out as a major concern in this vegetable oils take the lead constituting a significant 519 percent of the countrys total agricultural imports and making india the worlds largest importer of vegetable oils imports are also expected to double to an estimated us208 billion in 202324 from us108 billion in 201718 gtri 2023 this surge in imports poses challenges but at the same time offers a compelling opportunity for india to bolster its selfsufficiency in edible oils despite a substantial yield gap of over 50 percent in oilseeds there exists immense potential for enhancing domestic production through strategic technological interventions pathak 2023b most of these crops are cultivated under rainfed conditions on marginal lands and research shows that climate change is likely to have a negative impact on oilseed production birthal et al 2021 effectively addressing this multifaceted challenge thus necessitates a concerted effort including an expansion of irrigation infrastructure the provision of highquality seeds and the implementation of effective agricultural management practices these measures will be instrumental in bridging yield gaps in both oilseeds and pulse production within india fostering a more resilient and sustainable agricultural landscape balaji and sharma 2023 in recent decade supply chain disruptions stemming from global uncertainties have impacted trade and trade costs leading to higher inflation government interventions have been commendable in ensuring supplies through new contracts and domestic policy interventions efforts have been made to explore new suppliers and import destinations successfully averting the most adverse effects of the russiaukraine conflict to alleviate inflationary pressures on domestic prices exports of wheat rice and sugar were restricted as a result in 202324 major commodities such as nonbasmati rice pulses and sugar have exhibited negative growth with basmati rice proving an exception although this negative trend began before trade restrictions the ban on rice exports and the imposition of a 20 percent export tax on parboiled rice have state of indian agriculture 21acted as further contributing factors the government also resorted to imposing a 40 percent export tax on onions in order to curb rising domestic prices indias repeated attempts to restrict the export of major agricultural commodities such as the sona masuri rice variety sugar and onions have led to sharp spikes in the international prices of these commodities however global economic prospects remain uncertain the russiaukraine conflict has motivated the opening up of avenues for new food trade import substitution of edible oils and innovations in fertiliser production and use indias presence in the global agrifood market is on the rise demonstrating export competitiveness in commodities such as basmati and nonbasmati rice spices and shrimps despite this the untapped export potential of a number of commodities indicates scope for expanding the share of agricultural exports saxena et al 2023a 2023b lack of a welldeveloped infrastructure however poses a significant obstacle as it results in the spoilage of perishable goods and a reduction in export competitiveness transportation presents a major challenge including congestion the absence of dedicated cold chain transport corridors and inefficient logistics management these further impact the countrys export capabilities by increasing costs and causing delays the second major challenge revolves around the quality and traceability of agricultural produce indian agricultural products often face difficulties in meeting rigorous international quality and traceability standards which undermines their reputation and export potential ensuring consistent product quality is made more difficult by diverse farming practices and variations in quality across farms the complex and opaque nature of supply chains coupled with multiple intermediaries makes tracking the origin and handling of products more complicated this heightens the risk of fraud and adulteration which in turn impacts consumer trust and food safety despite ongoing efforts to implement farmtofork and traceability systems for various agricultural products challenges persist in terms of scalability cost and infrastructure a third challenge is related to nontariff measures ntms in export markets these impact major indian exports such as chilies tea basmati rice milk poultry and bovine meat countries such as those of the eu as well as japan china the usa south korea and russia impose high ntms in order to respond to factors such as higher pesticide levels and the presence of pests and contamination issues such as foot and mouth disease these issues often lead to the rejection of export consignments addressing these challenges requires upgrading 22 performance of indian agriculturedomestic systems reducing pesticide levels in food products and ensuring adherence to international quality standards jha and bathla 2021 the fourth and final challenge is that which india faces at the world trade organization wto regarding its agricultural policies while maintaining a large public stockholding of staple food grains for food security particularly rice and wheat indias practices have been challenged at the wto by developed countries notably the us the argument revolves around the perceived distortion of global agricultural markets with india countering that its public stockholding programme is crucial for fulfilling its constitutional mandate of ensuring food security it further argues that the agreement on agriculture provisions on domestic support are biased against developing countries successfully navigating these challenges is imperative if india is to sustain and enhance its position in the global agricultural landscape dhar 2023 17 processing and value addition of agricultural and allied products india holds a prominent position globally as a leader in food production however there is a noticeable gap when it comes to efficiently processing its vast agricultural output at 116 percent the gva of indias food processing industry fpi ranks among the lowest globally compared to 30 percent in china and 60 to 80 percent in developed economies dhanya et al 2020 indias evolving fpi nevertheless holds untapped potential which could have a substantial impact on its economy over the five years ending in 202021 the food processing sector has demonstrated remarkable growth boasting an average annual growth rate of approximately 84 percent this growth surpasses that of the agricultural and allied sector which stood at around 49 percent at 201112 prices during the same period this robust performance underlines the resilience of the food processing sector and its increasing role in shaping indias economic landscape it has emerged as a crucial player contributing significantly and strategically to key economic indicators including gdp employment generation and attracting foreign investment in 202021 it constituted 105 percent of gva in the manufacturing sector and 116 percent of the agricultural sectors gva table 6 to position itself as a frontrunner in food processing india must elevate its current food processing standards it must also address the harvest and postharvest loss of 25 to 30 percent of the countrys total agricultural produce jha et al 2015 this level of wastage makes the country unable state of indian agriculture 23to fully capitalise on its significant output of agricultural commodities light was shed on the magnitude of the issue by an extensive 2022 study conducted by nabard consultancy services pvt ltd nabcons which encompassed 54 agricultural products across 292 districts in 15 agro climatic zones this nabard study built on a previous examination by indian council of agricultural researchcentral institute of post harvest engineering and technology icarciphet ludhiana in 2015 which assessed harvest and postharvest losses for 45 agricultural crops spanning 107 districts in 14 agro climatic zones table 7 draws on both study reports to present a comparative analysis of the postharvest losses for major agricultural crops and commodities in india also relevant is the fact that developed nations predominantly export highvalueadded food products while a considerable proportion of indias food exports consist of lowmargin raw materials there is thus a crucial need for india to shift its focus toward the export of more valueadded processed food products rather than raw materials such a shift should be driven by the food processing industry which holds the potential to bring about transformative changes in the agricultural sector enhancements in food processing capabilities can play a pivotal role in reshaping the composition of indias

percent public gcfa pertains mainly to major medium and minor irrigation systems and its share has fallen steadily from 44 percent during the 1960s to 20 percent in the most recent decade the steady decline in the share of public gcfa in total expenditure has been attributed to the diversion of government expenditure toward revenue accounts in the form of an increase in input subsidies close to

land fragmentation should be considered a major reason for the low level of productivity poor mechanisation and the reduced income from agriculture analysis by state and union territory shows that nagaland has the largest average size of landholdings 49 ha this can be attributed to its vast land area of 17 mha and its relatively small population of 15 million punjab has the secondlargest

services across regions and landholding sizes it is often reported that the use of agricultural inputs such as seeds fertilisers plant protection chemicals and irrigation water is not rational or balanced indeed the overuse of scarce resources such as groundwater for irrigation can degrade the environment over time higher use of fertilisers and plant protection chemicals can cause a deterioration in soil quality can lead to water pollution and can undermine the health of farmers and consumers sharma chatrath sendhil 2013 sendhil et al 2018 fragmentation and small landholdings owing to land fragmentation the average farm landholding size continues to decline moving from 23 ha in agricultural census 197071 to 11 ha per farmer in agricultural census 201516 india moafw 2018 according to the 201516 agricultural census 87 percent of the total 1464 million landholdings are in the small category this makes it a challenging to adopt modern crop production technologies singh 2019 gulati and juneja 2022 heavy reliance on monsoons indian farmers rely heavily on monsoon rains for crop production climate change related uncertainties in the monsoon such as erratic rainfall and temperature anomalies are increasingly affecting resource use planning and farm profitability access to technological interventions and innovations social and economic restrictions on access to modern crop production technologies and resources affect production efficiency and thereby profitability access to technologies is also limited by distance and farm location escalating input costs as 87 percent of farmers are small holders the rising cost of inputs such as seeds fertilisers plant protection chemicals labour and energy will reduce farmers net returns and economic sustainability and will thus erode their interest in continuing to farm reliable information with the advent of the internet of things iot and the transformation of daytoday life brought out by information and communication technologies ict farmers have begun to get information from multiple sources including unverified social media this can create confusion as to the most optimal and judicious use of

enable judicious resource use and improve overall livelihoods state intervention government initiatives and interventions such as providing incentives supplying quality seeds facilitating credit and improving technology transfer through for example demonstrations will increase access to and adoption of technologies organic production increasing consumer interest in organic practices and products creates an incentive to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals organic produce earns premium prices in the market and promotes a sustainable ecosystem input management efficient technologies can help in the judicious use of scarce resources microirrigation techniques such as sprinkler and drip irrigation for example can increase water productivity and water use efficiency and the use of good

observed in the primary articles category particularly pulses and vegetables in other categories by contrast wpi numbers show a decline this dip in the index may be attributed to various factors including global market dynamics and shifts in demand and supply patterns the graphical representation in figure 26 illustrates the monthly wpi numbers for major primary articles over the span of a year the data state of indian agriculture 51reveals that apart from vegetables the wpi has maintained stability throughout the year vegetables specifically tomatoes experienced a significant surge in

calculation based on data from price monitoring division ministry of consumer affairs goithis behaviour is often associated with a degree of price volatility where these specific commodities experience notable price fluctuations over time this association between dynamic behaviour and price volatility is further affirmed by table 23 which unveils the price volatility observed in key primary commodities calculated using the cuddydella valle index and utilising monthly data spanning from january 2014 to december 2023 table 23 highlights that while cereal prices demonstrate a relatively stable pattern pulses oilseeds and vegetables exhibit significant levels of instability the alignment between the insights provided by the graphical representation and the quantified volatility in table 23 reinforces the understanding that certain commodities contribute to overall price volatility influencing market dynamics 362 consumer price index the consumer price index cpi is

technologies and cater to the needs of the resourceconstrained farming community limited awareness and skills the goal here is the achievement of accelerated adoption of modern agricultural technologies and innovations one challenge is the remote location of a majority of small and marginal farmers which restricts their access to modern agricultural technologies a second challenge that needs to be addressed is the lack of awareness education skills and financial resources fragmentation of operational holdings indian agriculture comprises mainly small and marginal landholders in most states landholdings are fragmented as a result diseconomies of scale and the resulting high costs prohibit farmers from implementing technologies such as combine harvesters and modified combines that allow for super straw management systems which provide a practical and more ecological nonburning way to handle rice straw gap in rural infrastructure rural regions often suffer from inadequate

to address the present and future challenges in indian agriculture concerted efforts and a multistake holder approach are called for this should include producers researchers government representatives and agencies the private sector institutions and civil society organisations such collaboration will help unlock the countrys potential and ensure robust technologydriven inclusive and sustainable developmentstate of indian agriculture 71indian agriculture is positioned to take advantage of multiple opportunities and at the same time faces numerous challenges given the diverse nature of agricultural practices across the country a one sizefitsall policy approach may not work some general action points that could be adopted in each state to address challenges and unleash opportunities in indian agriculture are summarised below 61 accelerate public and private investments in agriculture in india investment in agriculture is lower than that allocated for other economic and social services according to figures for various years from indias planning commission the resources allocated to subsectors such as crops veterinary services dairy and fisheries do not match what they contribute to the value of outputs there is thus a call for greater allocation of resources to the agricultural sector especially for improving productivity promoting agricultural diversification and developing infrastructure for flood control irrigation and drainage management and land development investment in livestock should be enhanced especially to provide better breeding and veterinary services and the dairy subsector shows immense potential with a strong smallholder bias fruit and vegetable growing also offers huge potential and there needs to be further strengthening of markets as well as cold storage cold chain and warehouse infrastructure business models may be developed to attract the private sector to invest in production as well as in postharvest and marketing activities the agricultural research and extension system needs to be reenergised and sufficient resources should be allocated for undertaking needsbased research higher allocation of resources to agriculture will lead to more inclusive growth and alleviate poverty and under nourishment provision of input support on fertilisers irrigation and power should not be at the cost of investment in agriculture input subsidies should be rationalised by targeting states tenant farmers women way forward for sustainable and inclusive agricultural growth6 72 way forward for sustainable and inclusive agricultural growthfarmers and small and marginal farmers farmers cards should be issued to all so that they may reap the benefits of government schemes 62 bridge the yield gaps huge yield gaps exist for most crops as a result of different farming practices and levels of technology integration even with existing levels of technology important opportunities are available for transforming agriculture adoption of higher yielding varieties and improved technologies and practices can considerably enhance crop yields through front line demonstrations researchers interface directly with farmers in the process of introducing monitoring and receiving feedback around new technologies the increased yields resulting from this unique approach indicate the potential of proactively introducing improved technologies into existing farm practices in addition to newer highyielding varieties better management practices also have enormous potential to increase agricultural productivity better soil and water management seed replacement adoption of resource conservation technologies such as conservation agriculture laser land levelling and direct seeded rice could prove very effective in raising crop

the landscape of indian agriculture they cast a shadow on the sectors overall stability and sustainability despite substantial efforts to modernise and adopt advanced farming techniques the average yield 74 way forward for sustainable and inclusive agricultural growthin india is less than the major producers figure 32 reveals the status of average yield of major food produce in india and leading producing nations like china and usa figure 32 average yield of major food produce in india visavis leading producer the sector at the same time grapples with high levels of vulnerability that stem primarily from the impacts of climate change erratic weather patterns and natural disasters figure 33 shows the districts in india that experience medium to high vulnerability to climate change farmers are often at the mercy of unpredictable conditions making their livelihoods precarious addressing the twin challenges of low productivity and high vulnerability to climate change natural disasters and increasingly erratic weather patterns requires comprehensive reforms that encompass technological advancements improved infrastructure and robust policies that are aimed at enhancing productivity reducing vulnerabilities and fortifying the resilience of indian agriculture in the face of a rapidly changing environment 64 promote agricultural diversification agricultural diversification toward high value commodities such as fruits vegetables fisheries poultry etc in india has emerged as one of the most important strategies for ensuring sustainable and inclusive

districts experiencing high vulnerability to climate change growth the share of high value commodities in total value of agricultural output is increasing and their consumption is also growing much faster than cereals and food grain crops in the long run increased crop yields and prices contribute significantly to the growth of the crops sector increased farm pricesterms of trade however may not be a sustainable source of growth priceled growth would also not be propoor and would threaten the food security of landless agricultural labourers and even marginal farmers emphasis should be on a sustained increase in crop yields through technological upgradation and diversification toward high value commodities this which constitute sustainable and inclusive sources of growth however inadequate crop diversification stands as a prominent constraint within the framework of indian agriculture posing multifaceted challenges to the sector the prevailing reliance on a limited set of crops not only compromises the resilience of agricultural systems but also exposes farmers to heightened risks associated with fluctuating market conditions and climatic uncertainties figure 34 shows the distribution of gross cropped area percentages at two distinct times 201213 and 201920 demonstrating a nearly identical distribution the predominant focus on staple crops such as rice and wheat has led vulnerable districts 38 076 way forward for sustainable and inclusive agricultural growthfigure 33 state wise distribution of districts experiencing high vulnerability to climate change source

diversification the lack of crop diversity also contributes to soil degradation and reduces the nutritional value of the land this constraint not only undermines the longterm productivity of indian agriculture but also impedes farmers adaptability to changing environmental conditions further promotion of horticulture livestock and fisheries will not only contribute to agricultural growth but will also enhance farm income these commodities are very wellsuited to the needs of smallholders as they use mostly the family labour and provide regular and high returns these commodities however have higher risk of perishability and price volatility linking producers with remunerative markets and developing appropriate infrastructure such as cold storage and refrigerated vans would be a prerequisite for promoting high value commodities several innovative integrated marketing models have emerged conducive policies and institutional frameworks should be developed to improve smallholders access to these marketing models to promote and sustain agricultural diversification in the long run greater emphasis should be placed on value addition and on processing across the value chain of high value commodities indias level of value addition and processing is currently the lowest at approximately 10 percent this compares to 40 to 50 percent in developed countries bathla and gautam 2021source agricultural statistics at a glance 2022 moafw 2022figure 34 percentage share of area to gross cropped area in two distinct periodsstate of indian agriculture 7765 link farmers with markets agriculture in india is dominated by marginal and small farmers as per the latest agricultural census 85 percent of farm households undertake farming on landholdings of less than 2 hectares and 68 percent of farmers operate on less than 1 hectare their small scale prevents them from marketing and retailing perishable and high value commodities they also lack information on the grades and standards that are imposed by supermarkets and on the sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures that are required under the current trade regime there is thus a need to effectively link these small producers with remunerative domestic and global markets successful models are already available in the country but need to be upscaled attracting the corporate sector for investment in markets agroprocessing and land development is still a challenge 66 strengthen institutions and improve rural infrastructure in india institutions have already been significantly strengthened and infrastructure has been much improved in many parts of the eastern and northeastern regions however much needs yet to be done tremendous progress has occurred in recent years in improving land records however correcting land records settling disputes on ownership and correcting land lease markets remain a major challenge to enhance the participation of smallholders it is important to strengthen cooperatives farmers associations selfhelp groups and the like for collective production and marketing strengthening credit insurance input services and extension services would also assist in meeting the needs of smallholders there has been significant improvement in basic infrastructure especially the rural roads network market facilities and the power sector these improvements importantly support developmental activities in the agricultural sector this momentum needs to be maintained the irrigation and drainage network also needs to be prioritised for improvement in order to increase production and minimise risk 67 harness frontier technologies and agristartups many fascinating innovations have emerged in the agricultural sector which among other things improve efficiency precision and safety however the pace of diffusion of these frontier technologies in india is 78 way forward for sustainable and inclusive agricultural growthslow frontier technologies that have immense potential to improve the welfare of farming communities include 1 biotechnology 2 digital technology 3 nanotechnology 4 space science and global positioning system gps tools and 5 advanced engineering technologies including sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs breakthroughs in these fields have enormous potential for application in crop production animal husbandry fishing and agribusiness these technologies can significantly benefit producers and consumers as well as the ecology society and the economy more generally the benefits can be realised through enhancing productivity reducing cost increasing efficiency empowering informed decisionmaking minimising preand postharvest losses improving the quality and safety of the produce reducing emissions and promoting climate change mitigation and adaptation most of the emerging technologies that have huge potential for revolutionising agriculture are being developed in different agricultural and nonagricultural disciplines and institutes their application is expected to help usher in future revolutions in agriculture agri startups have emerged as significant players in the introduction of
