plays a vital role in food and nutritional security of the country nearly 55 per cent of the world population depends on wheat for about 20 per cent of calories intake it is one of the major food grains of the country and a staple food of the people of north india where people have preference for chapatti the diverse environmental conditions and food habits of people in india supports the cultivation of three types of wheat bread durum and dicoccum among these bread wheat is contributing approximately 95 per cent to total production while another 04 per cent comes from durum wheat and close to one per cent from dicoccum wheat crop in india is grown under six diverse agroclimatic zones table 1 wherein indogangetic plains igps comprising the two zones namely north western plains zone

could be suitably applied to all the given situations across zones and production conditions in addition the planners managers and carriers of technology extension workers at every level can also update themselves with the latest know how and play their role in enhancing wheat production in the country agronomic practices in addition to the varietal improvement adoption of appropriate crop management practices of fertilization irrigation weed management crop geometry and crop residue management in wheat based crop sequences in various wheat growing zones have significantly contributed in harnessing the yield potential of new varieties to cut down the cost of wheat production without compromising on yield the zerotillage technology has been perfected for wheat cultivation other forms of resource conservation technologies rcts which are also gaining momentum include rotarytillage and furrow irrigated raised beds firbs technology the rotary tillage technology saves about 80 per cent diesel but has given 6 wheat cultivation in indiahigher yields over zero tillage as well as conventional tillage recently new machines turbo seeder rotary disc drill have been fabricated to seed into surface retained crop residues which is otherwise being burnt causing environmental pollution and loss of essential plant nutrients sowing time seed rate and fertilizer application the wheat crop in india is grown across six agroclimatic zones and production conditions the time of sowing has slight variation from zone to zone and under varying production conditions to realize best yields under any situation timely sowing and following recommended agronomy is the most important key factor to make best use of inputs and technology the information for the commercial cultivation of wheat crop under different systems is given in table 3 approaches for improving soil health the intensive tillage coupled with crop residue burning and continuous mining of soil has led to the depletion of soil organic matter as well as essential plant nutrients the situation is further complicated by imbalanced fertilization leading to expression of multiple nutrient deficiencies the zn is already recommended and there are more frequent occurrence of deficiencies of mn fe cu mo and b in the ricewheat system more than 35 soils are also deficient in sulphur and the k status has also reached a

herbicides clodinafop fenoxaprop and pinoxaden should not be tank mixed with either 24d or metsulfuron and to avoid antagonism the grass and broadleaved herbicides should be applied sequentially water management water is becoming a limiting factor in wheat production all over the country and irrigation scheduling is followed depending on the availability of water excess utilization of ground water in dry areas has led to depletion of underground water and farmers are expecting to get reasonable grain yield with sub optimal irrigation through restricted irrigation a single post sown irrigation under rainfed condition can double the grain yield of many of the wheat genotypes the normal practice of applying four to six irrigations 2842 cmha water are enough for wheat crop however crown root initiation and flowering stages are the most critical to moisture stress depending upon the water availability irrigation should be applied as per the schedule in case of very light soil as well as area having undulating topography sprinkler method of irrigation should be used also in light soil and in area having water scarcity bed planting techniques can be adopted as it saves 30 water further laser land leveling must be popularized on large scale as it will help in 12 wheat cultivation in indiaimproving the input use efficiency particularly of water and nitrogen the injudicious use of fertilizers and water has led to numerous problems such as deteriorating soil health and receding water table therefore use of ndvi sensors and microirrigation for efficient nitrogen and irrigation water management respectively coupled with adoption of conservation agriculture practices can help increase the crop productivity as well as improvement of natural resource base for long term sustainability crop protection the host resistance is the cheapest effective and environmental friendly means of management of diseases and pests the disease scenario of different zones varies but the

for your area and condition follow timely planting and avoid delay in sowing of wheat crop to avoid yield losses due to adverse effects of heat around maturity do not grow varieties from other zones to avoid risk of disease susceptibility manage your crop with optimum inputs fertilizer irrigation water herbicides fungicides for maximum yield timely and judiciously irrigate fields to save water and cut costs harvest crop at proper maturity to minimize risk due to shattering threshing etc follow proper storage practices for wheat produce to avoid postharvest losses 20 wheat cultivation in indianew production technologies for resource conservation laser land levelling generally fields are not properly levelled leading to poor performance of the crop because part of area suffers due to water stress and the other parts due to excess of water laser land levelling is the fore most requirements for the adoption of any of the resource conservation technologies it is a process of smoothening the field within 2 cm from the average elevation of the field using laser equipped bucket which scraps from higher places and spread onto the low lying areas after laser levelling the field yield increase has been observed the higher yields are due to proper crop stand uniform fertilizer and water distribution crop growth uniform maturity and increased cultivable area by 3 to 6 per cent due to reduction in area under bunds and channels in addition to higher yield the savings of water is 3545 per cent due to higher application as well as use efficiencies and increased nutrient use efficiency by 1525 per cent in recent years the adoption of laser levelling by the farmers has gained momentum due to evident benefits of this technology right in the first crop the price of this machine is around 35 lakhs which is not within the reach of every farmer and hence has to be used on custom hire basis 21 wheat cultivation in indiazero tillage zero tillage zt sowing of wheat is a profitable resource conservation technique in this technology wheat seed and fertilizers are directly placed at proper depth into the undisturbed soil after rice harvesting using a specially designed machine which creates narrow slits by the knife type furrow openers of zero tillage fertiseed drill instead of shovel type furrow opener in conventional ferti seed drill the money and time to be spent in field preparation are saved by using this machine both timely and late sowing of wheat is possible by this method and in case of late sown even sowing can be advanced by 710 days seed rate fertilizer doses and other package of practices in zt should be the same as in conventional method to get good yield apply or even lesser n full p k at sowing and the remaining nitrogen in two equal splits at first and second irrigation avoid planking after sowing of wheat by this machine the cost effectiveness and development of resistance against isoproturon in phalaris minor was also responsible for zt adoption in ricewheat system due to lower incidence of this weed under zt incidence of karnal bunt and termite has also been reported to be less in zt this machine can sow about two acres of wheat in one hour the carbon dioxide emission due to burning of fuel assuming 26 kg co 2 production litre of diesel burnt during field preparation is about 208 kgha in conventional tillage where as in zero tillage it is only around 16 kgha 22 wheat cultivation in indiaadvantages saving of time drudgery water labour money and energy as well as less wear and tear of machinery helps in advancing the sowing of wheat by 7 to 10 days which is very useful especially under late sown conditions where basmati rice cottonsugarcane harvesting is delayed beyond 25 th november this technology provides an opportunity to save more than 3000 per hectare in cost of cultivation thereby increasing the profit margin of the farmers very less chances of lodging less diseases especially karnal bunt and powdery mildew as well as lower infestation of weeds like phalari minor yield is either same or higher 510 than conventional method especially in sodic soils where water logging is a problem as well as areas where sowing of wheat is late rotary tillage rotary tillage is an important resource conservation technology which facilitates field preparation and placing of seed and fertilizer in a single pass the rotary till drill has six lshaped blades on each gang which completely pulverises soil seed rate and fertilizers doses are similar to conventional method this machine is also very effective for incorporation of dhaincha into soil as green manuring crop it can also be used for single pass 23 wheat cultivation in indiapuddling of paddy field after removing the drilling mechanism this machine can cover about one acre area in one hour advantages rotary tillage also saves time labour and energy and reduces drudgery in field preparation compared to conventional method there is a saving of more than 2500 per hectare in field preparation if drilled rotary tillage always gives yield advantage of 5 to 10 per cent than conventional and zero tillage technologies advances sowing of wheat by 3 to 5 days bed planting levelling of field is a pre condition for the success of this technology the field preparations bed formation placement of fertilizer and sowing of seed is completed in one go by bed planter furrows are used for irrigation as well as for drainage of excess water if there is heavy rain during crop season generally 23 rows of wheat can be planted on the top of each bed the top width of each bed is 4045cm for a bed of 7075cm with furrow of 3035 cm inter cropping of sugarcane can be taken up with wheat by this technique crop cultivars are known to vary significantly in their performance on raised beds the direction of sowing should be northsouth so that every plant gets equal sun shine in situations where sowing is expected to be delayed due to 24 wheat cultivation in indiapresowing irrigation dry seeding can be done on raised beds followed by irrigation immediately after seeding light irrigation can also be given at grain filling stage which is generally avoided by the farmers for fear of crop lodging growing crops on raised beds can also help in diversification of the ricewheat system raised bed system also provides an option for growing intercrops like sugarcane in furrows and wheat gram lentil peas mustard and various vegetable crops on beds since only rd area is irrigated ie irrigation is applied in furrows there is substantial saving of irrigation water advantages saves 2025 percent seed ie 30 to 32 kgacre seed is sufficient for sowing although there is no saving on the cost of land preparation or time but if same beds are used for seeding next crop the saving similar to rotary tillage can be made as seeding shaping of beds can be done in a single operation suitable for seed production because of production of bold grain and easy rouging by moving in furrows to uproot unwanted plants it reduces the herbicide dependence due to possibility of mechanical weed control with the same bed planter fitted with inter culture tynes with simultaneous placement of fertiliser nitrogen use efficiency is higher because of light irrigation and top dressing or placement on beds leading to fertilizer nitrogen saving by about 25 similar yield as in conventional tillage with substantial saving of seed fertilizer nitrogen and irrigation water 25 wheat cultivation in indiaseeding into loose residues in nwpz farmers generally burn the paddy straw which causes air pollution reduces soil biodiversity lowers fertility loss of precious organic carbon and nutrients the retention of residue on soil surface has many benefits as it reduces weeds conserves moisture moderates soil temperature and improves soil health keeping the above facts in view two machines were developed to discourage burning namely rotary disc drill and turbo happy seeder which are discussed below turbo happy seeder the turbo happy seeder was developed at pau ludhiana under aciarpau project this machine works on rotary mechanism and cuts the residue in front of the tynes places seed and fertiliser using zero till machine and push the chopped straw through the tynes on to the seeded area this machine is capable of seeding into the loose residue load of up to 10 tha this machine can cover an area of one acre per hour it requires a tractor of more than 50 hp with a dual clutch rotary disc drill rdd the rotary disc drill was developed at dwr karnal under natp project on mechanization of ricewheat system for sowing of wheat into loose straw it has been found effective for seeding into loose crop residues this machine is also based on the rotary till mechanism the rotor is a horizontal transverse shaft 26 wheat cultivation in indiahaving flanges fitted with straight discs for cutting effect similar to the wooden saw while rotating the rotary disc drill is mounted on the three point linkage system and is powered through the power takeoff pto shaft of tractor the rotating discs cut the residue and simultaneously make a narrow slit into the soil to facilitate placement of seed and fertilizer using an offset double disc assembly rotary disc drill is more versatile and works under almost all the situations like paddy cotton bajra arhar sugarcane ratoons with full trash for seeding crops without tillage compared to normal zero till drill rotary disc drill causes minimal soil disturbance however it must be remembered that in the presence of loose residues combination of rotary disc with coulter double disc completely avoids the raking problem of residues during seeding operations both these machines have problems like turbo happy seeder doesnt work when residue is wet or completely loose and rotary disc drill has problem of frequent blunting of front powered discs these problems must be addressed to make these machines more acceptable harvesting threshing and storage when the moisture level of grain is 25 it is the proper time for manual harvesting generally wheat is manually harvested but for quick harvesting combine harvester should be used to avoid losses in grain yield due to shattering and lodging wheat should be harvested 45 days before it is dead ripe in nwpz due to synchronized 27 wheat cultivation in indiamaturity of wheat combine harvesting is done morning is the best time for harvesting in case of manual harvesting bundles are made and dried for 34 days and threshed by thresher before storage grain should be dried by spreading on tarponline plastic sheets in bright sunlight to a moisture level below 12 for storage use bins and silos made of gi sheets now a days aluminium bins pusa bins silos and poly lined bags are available for storage farmers can store wheat grains in their traditional storage as well to protect from storage insects pests it is necessary to fumigate with edb 5 gtons and keeping room sealed for 24 hours farmers can also apply aluminium phosphide 3 gton costs and returns there is a wide variation in operational costs gross returns profit and also the cost of production in different states of india table 6 the difference in costs and other parameters might be due to several associated factors that vary across states the gross return per hectare was the maximum in haryana followed by punjab rajasthan uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh the estimated average operation cost for the country was 25054ha and net return was 33915ha the cost of production for one quintal wheat was 730 28 wheat cultivation in indiatable 6 state wise costs and returns for wheat in india during 201213 state operational costs ha gross returns ha

india 25054 58969 33915 730 29 wheat cultivation in india4 w 1 h of wheat cultivation what to do when to do how to do why to do what not to do soil testing october after harvesting of crop take samples from all corners and middle of field and mix well draw 500 gm soil sample from it and get it tested in nearby soil testing laboratoryit will give information about soil fertility of the particular field so that one can apply fertilizer as per soil requirement recommendationsdont collect the soil sample from heap of the compost residue standing crop to get the accurate results field preparation field preparation should starts from october by good ploughing followed by planking for moisture conservation field should be well leveled so use laser land leveler for leveling the field which is quite beneficial field should be well prepared by disc harrow and cultivator as per requirement of the soil land laser leveler can be used for perfect land leveling it can be arranged from nearby source if not available in the villagegood field preparation will help in weed control irrigation will be uniform and saving of irrigation water in the leveled field to conserve soil moisture there should not be deep heavy cultivation if sowing is to be done by zero tillage then harrow cultivation should be avoided three four field preparation operations should be done and then do leveling through planker irrigation will be faster and saving of irrigation water in the raised bed fieldin heavy soils avoided bed planting due to clod formation crop stubbles may affect germination 30 wheat cultivation in indiasowing method if there is loose straw in the field use rotary disc drillhappy seeder if there is sufficient moisture after paddy harvesting use both the machines for wheat sowing sowing is to be done by drilling seed and fertilizer seed and fertilizer pipes should be checked carefully during drilling operation by keeping crop residues in field weeds can be controlled residue retention helps in conserving moisture and increases soil organic matter do not burn crop residues by burning the crop residues beneficial insets may die there is no need to proper field in zero tillage seeding selection of improved varietiesin october selection of recommended suitable varieties should be done through discussion with the representative of research centre state agriculture department friends etc it will increase productivity of the crop and good quality may fetch higher prices in the marketdont use old varieties such as pbw 343 up 2338 lok 1 hd 2687 hd 2329 wh 711 huw 234 up 262 wh 147 as they have become susceptible to yellow rust disease balanced and integrated use of fertilizers npk in 421 ratio at the time of sowing and after the first irrigation micronutrients may be applied as per requirement and deficiency in the soil13 of nitrogen full of phosphorus and potash may be applied at the time of sowing rest of nitrogen may be applied after first and second irrigation all essential nutrients are made available to the plants through balanced and integrated nutrient management application the crop will be healthy with higher productivity deficiency of one element may affect availability of other elementseed and fertilizer should not be placed at the same place in the soil it will affect germination adversely and productivity will be less so fertilizers should be placed deeper than seed if sown with seed cum fertilizer drill 31 wheat cultivation in indiairrigation the pre sowing irrigation in october followed by as per requirement and availabilitybunds may be prepared in and around the field and field should be divided in equal parts so that irrigation may be uniform easy and quickit will help in field preparation better germination and production of bumper crop there should be judicious use of irrigation waterdont apply heavy irrigation in standing crop otherwise there may be loss instead of benefit due to water logging weed control at 3035 days after sowing spray properly and use recommended doses of herbicides use flat fan nozel for uniform application there will be economic loss by weeds if their population goes beyond threshold leveldont mix two or more herbicides without recommendations 24d and metsulfuran with clodinafopfenoxaprop dont use wheat seed contaminated with weed seedsdo not under dose herbicidesdont use same herbicide year after year in the same field use ofresistance varieties october november procure healthy seed from reliable sources use of healthy and resistant varieties prevent crop from diseases dont use varieties which are not recommended otherwise there may be danger of disease spread 32 wheat cultivation in indiaseed treatment at the time of sowing seed treatment should be done one day before sowing raxil 10gm kg seed or vitavex 20gmkg seed or thiramvitavax 11 may be used for seed treatment for smuts seed treatment drum may be used for seed treatment only seed treatment may give protection to soil and seed borne diseases germination will be better plants will be healthier and have capacity to fight against diseasesdont sow seed without seed treatment otherwise smuts covered and loose may cause heavy losses treatment against termite aphid karnal bunt and powdery mildew 34 days after first irrigation chloropyriphos 20ec 3 litre mixed in 50 kg soil be used for one hectare field there should be optimum moisture in the field so that the chemical may go in to the soil and control termitebroadcast pest treated sand soil to avoid termite damagedont use termite treatment if it is not required do not apply termite treatment if sufficient moisture in not available in soil aphid control only after visual appearance of aphid at the borders of the fieldto control aphid apply imidachloprid confidor 200 sl 15 ml in 35 l water the application should be around the borders 23 meters inside the fieldthere is loss due to aphid attack in wheat cropdont broadcast the chemical for aphid control in whole field it may affect the friendly pest like lady bird beetle it is important that beneficial insects remain active inside the field 33 wheat cultivation in indiaharvesting manual harvesting is done when the grain moisture is 20 percent use combine harvester when the grain moisture is below 14 percentif the grains appear hard when pressed under teeth then the crop is ready for harvest grain quality will be better at optimum time of harvesting there may be less damage due to pest under proper storage and germination will be better doesnt use combine harvester if the moisture is more otherwise grains will be damaged and the grain quality will be affected fetching lower prices storage moisture should be below 12 percentstorage should be at airy open space use pesticides in rainy seasonin rainy season grains will absorb moisture and may be damaged by storage pests dont store at high moisture condition otherwise it may lose viability or storage pest damage may occur 34 wheat cultivation in india
