agricultural economics and policy research particularly to dr suresh pal director for this opportunity dr jhas contributions to make the institute a center of excellence on research in agricultural policy are well known today i would like to share our views on agriculture in the current contex t opportunities and challenges focus area s for deliberation today are i sustainability of indian agriculture ii climate change risk in agriculture iii increasing farmers income i sustainable agriculture in a rapidly changing world the agriculture sector is witnessing a metamorphosis of unprecedented dimension in such a quickly changing world can agriculture be sustainable this apparent paradox has sparked a million debates and innovative thinking and has provided the much needed direction and a sense of urgency for an agriculture system which needs to be inherently and fundamentally sustainable for survival of homo sapiens as a specie s defining sustainable agriculture the word sustain comes from the latin sustinere sus from below and tenere to hold to keep in existence or maintain and implies long term support or permanence as it pertains to agriculture sustainable describes farming systems that are capable of maintaining their productivity and usefulness to the society indefinitely su ch systems must be resource conserving socially supportive commercially competitive and environmentally sound1 some terms defy definition sustainable agriculture is one of them let me quote a definition of sustainable agriculture mentioned in the farm bill2 introduced in the us as early as in 1990 under that law the term 1 john ikerd as quoted by richard duesterhaus in sustainabilitys promise journal of soil and water conservation jan feb 1990 451 p4 2 food

opportunities and ch allenges sustainable agriculture means an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site specific application that will over the long term satisfy human food and fiber needs enhance environmental quality and the natural resource base upon which the agricultural economy depends make the most efficient use of non renewable resources and on farm resources and integrate where appropriate na tural biological cycles and controls sustain the economic viability of farm operations and enhance the quality of life for farmers and society as a whole paramparagat kheti in india the agricultural heritage india has a long history and tradition of harmonious co existence between man and nature we represent a culture that calls our planet mother earth since the vedic age we have been practicing paramparagat kheti a form of agricultural practice which is organic nonexploitative and totally in harmony with the nature environmental sustainability which involves both intra generational and inter generational equity has been the approach of indian agriculture for a very long period of time traditionally man animals trees includin g grass lands and agricultural fields were inseparable and harmonious components of a single system3 the villager looked after the trees on his fields and also contributed to the maintenance of the community grazing land he looked after the animals owne d by him sometimes with the assistance of a grazing hand and cultivated the fields owned by him with o r without hired labour or share croppers the trees provided fodder for the cattle they also provided fuel for the villagers the leaves that fell wer e put to uses beneficial to the agricultural fields meanwhile their soil and water conservation properties were beneficial for the villagers and contributed to maintaining the fertility of agricultural fields as well as providing sha de during the scorch ing summer in addition certain trees provided edible fruits medicines gum s toothpaste and a host of other commodities of everyday use in some villages trees were used for lac cultivation and for raising silkworms and bees owing to their water conse rvation properties trees were also 3 httpsatavicorgtraditional agriculture inindia high yields andnowaste 3 p a g e agriculture in the c urrent cont ext opportunities and ch allenges responsible in several villages for ensuring an adequate supply of drinking water cattle provided milk and milk products and contributed to the nutritional content of the villagers diet cattle dung provided organic fertilizers for the fields while the poultry provided eggs and meat the skins of dead cattle were used for making footwear and other le ather products all such activities being carried out in the village not least bullocks ploughed the fields the fields produced food grains pulses oilseeds and vegetables for the villagers the residues of those crops of no direct use to man were fed to the cattle poultry birds scavenged the wast ed scattered grain the agriculture heritage of india was therefore in total harmony with nature and therefore self sustaining need for a new a pproach to agriculture in india however with the increase in population green revolution a resource intensive cultivation technology was introduced in early 19 60s which resulted in exponential increase in production and productivity in certain major crops like wheat rice in india especially in the green revolution area s of our country however this seed water fertilizer technology has been criticized by many economists as a technocratic solution with major sustainability and equity concerns further of late climate change has emerged as the biggest risk multiplier in the agriculture sector of india few countries in the world are as vulnerable to the effects of climate change as india is with its vast population that is dependent on the growth of its agrarian economy the vulnerability to climate change is accentuated by the fact that india s agriculture sector with a mere 24 per cent share of the worlds land and a 40 per cent share of the worlds freshwater resources has to cater to 175 per cent of the worlds population4 thus a totally new approach based on the following twin sustainabi lity requirement s is a sine quanon f or the agriculture and allied sector

soil get s degraded annually in india soil loss is about 164 tons per ha annually icar reported that out of the total geographical area of 32873 million hectares about 12040 million hectares 37 per cent were affected by various kinds of land degradation5the different form s of land degrada tion in india is furnished in the pie diagram given below the quality of soil has also deteriorated over time due to a combination of factors such as injudicious use of chemical fertilizer s accumulation of heavy metals and metalloids through various forms of emissions water scarcity regional imbalance there is a huge temporal and spatial variation in rainfall and water availability in the country most of the water is available during the monsoon and in a few spells of intense rainfall resulting in floods in major rivers estimates show that whereas the lower rainfall zone less than 750 5 degraded and wastelands of india status and spatial distribution 2010 icar 5 p a g e agriculture in the c

very high rainfall zone more than 2000 mm accounts for the remaining 8 per cent of the net sown area irrigation potential out of the total geographical area of 329 mi llion hectares mha of the country the total cropped area is about 194 mha out of which net sown area is only about 140 mha only about 66 mha ie 476 per cent of the net sown area is reported as irrigated there is a need to bring more cropped are a under assured irrigation to increase agriculture productivity and production the ultimate irrigation potential of the country is estimated at about 140 mha with about 76 mha from surface water sources and about 64 million hectares from groundwater sources there is an urgent need to invest large amount of resources to augment irrigation to its potential level poor irrigation efficiency the average annual rainfall is 1170 mm 117m taking 70 per cent of the rainfall as effective for crop consump tive use the gross water use is about 145 m 48 feet per ha of the gross irrigated area this is very high compared to water use in irrigation systems in developed countries such as the usa where water allocation is about 90 cm this overuse in the c ountry reflects low irrigation efficiency of about 25 per cent to 35 per cent in most irrigation systems with efficiency of 40 per cent to 45 per cent in a few exceptional cases6 the method of irrigation followed in the country is flood irrigation whic h results in a lot of water loss wasteful use of ground water groundwater accounts for about 60 of the irrigated area heavy subsidies in electricity consumed for agriculture have tended to encourage wasteful use of energy and water this has also encouraged farmers to overdraw water from deep aquifers causing substantial depletion of the water table and deterioration of water quality in many cases competing demand the demand for water for various purposes is increasing due to population growth urbanization and industrialization presently the agriculture sector is using about 83 per cent of available water resources but demand from other sectors may reduce availability for agricultural use to 68 per cent by 2050 6 state of indian agriculture 2015 16 department of

has seen rapid expansion and intensification in india the average consumption of fertilizers in india rose from 1055 kg per ha in 2005 06 to 12834 kg per ha in 2012 13a common belief is that the ideal balance among n p and k in india is 4 2 1 in 2012 13 the proportions stood at 82321 in this context it is noteworthy that a recent national institute of agricultural economics and policy research niap study7 report s that one third of the majo r states apply excess n and two thirds apply it at below optimum level while six states namely andhra pradesh assam punjab bihar haryana and jharkhand use proportionately more n than would be warranted by the optimal mix 12 states use it in subop timal proportion the study finds similar regional imbalances in the use of p and k excessive use of pesticides although in per hectare terms pesticide use in india is much lower than in other countries especially developed ones pesticide residues in produce in india have been found to be high there are at least five reasons for this phenomenon8 first while pesticides are overwhelmingly used to control weeds in the developed countries they are used to control insects that attack grains fruits and vegetables in india second chemicals used in india are more dangerous than those used in developed countries in india organochloride formulations which are more dangerous continue to be used whereas the developed countries have shifted to safer organ ophosphates and pyrethroids third after being applied pesticides remain in soil water or plant for some time before they break down farmers often lack knowledge of waiting period of various pesticides fourth the central insecticide board and registr ation committee cibrc regulate s pesticide use in india farmers of ten remain unaware of pesticide recommendations of the cibrc farmers are also unaware of the bio pesticides that currently constitute 42 of the total pesticide market in india finally high pesticide residues in indian food products also result from inadequate access to latest technologies 7raising agricultural productivity and making farming remunerative for farmers an occasional paper niti aayog government of india 16

over the last 30 years forests nearly two thirds the size of haryana have been lost to encroachments 15000 sq km and 23716 industrial projects 14000 sq km forest is an important part of the agricultural eco system large scale afforestation encompassing commercial forestry farm forestry social forestry captive plantation as also adoption of community based forest management practices like joint forest management is the need of the hour integrated farming system9 integrated productionfarming is a farming system that produces high quality food and other products by using natural resources and regulating mechanisms to replace polluting inputs an d to secure sustainable farming emphasis is placed on o a holistic systems approach involving the entire farm as the basic unit o the central role of agro ecosystems o balanced nutrient cycles o the welfare of al l species in animal husbandry and o preservation and improvement of soil fertility of a diversified environment and the observation of ethical and social criteria natural resource allocation among competing demands current land use pattern for agriculture in many states are not based on principle of comparative advantage crop pattern s in various region s are inefficient in terms of resource use and unsust ainable from natural resource use point of view this is resulting into serious misallocation of

inputs particularly energy water and fertilizers are accentuating the problem the allocation of natural resources should follow the principle of sustainability and efficien cy for right sharing of resources among competing demands what ag riculture commodity to produce how much to produce export should be decided based on the twin principle s of sustainability and efficiency unfortunately a griculture in india is predomin antly focused on raising water intensive crops like rice and wheat at the expense of dry land crops like pulses further india a water scarce country has been exporting water as a result of distorted incentives goswami and nishad 2015 estimate d water content embedded in crops at the time of trade this is different from water used in production which is much higher water embedded in crops is the water content of each crop and once the crop is exported it cannot be recovered in 2010 india exported about 25 cu km of water embedded in its agricultural exports this is equivalent to the demand of nearly 13 million people india was a net importer of water until around 1980s however with increase in food grain exports india has now become a net exporter of water about 1 per cent of total available water every year the ratio of export to import of such virtual water is about 4 for india and 01 for china thus china remains a net importer of water this is also evident in china s and ind ias trade patterns china imports water intensive soybeans cotton meat and cereal grains while exporting vegetables fruits and processed food india on the other hand exports water intensive rice cotton sugar and soybean10 need for appropriate regional planning there is a need to develop optim al crop plan at regional levels for better resource use efficiency sustainability and maximizing farm income based on the study of the existing land use cropping pattern and resource efficiency across r egions only an optimal crop planning based on comparative

consistent warming trends and more frequent and intense extreme weather events across india in the recent decades the impact of climate change on agriculture has large detrimental effects on availability of food livelihoods income of farmers and the over all economy small and marginal farmers pastoralists and fisher folk will be the worst sufferers some of the major anticipated impacts are highlighted below 1 macro impacts of climate change 11 at the macro level the following adverse effects of climate change on indian agriculture have been predicted reduction of agriculture yields in medium term 2010 2039 up to 45 9 reduction of agriculture yield in long term 2040 and beyond 25 if no measure is taken fall in gdp growth in medium term up to 2 per annum 2 climate risks at three

water recharge will affect irrigation degradation in soil quality and moisture content possibilities of salination of land due to sea water ingress and salt accumulation iii livestock fisherie s livestock will be affected due to heat stress new diseases poor quality of feed and rising fodder prices heat stress will reduce milk production by 10 25 warming will affect reproductive rates of livestock changes in aquatic habitat and ecosystem would impact fisheries 3 key risks the key risks to indian agriculture due to climate variability include increased threat of food insecurity and malnutrition increased threat to livelihood of farmers reduced return from farming farmers distress huge resources for adapting and mitigating the climate risk in the agriculture sector 4 resource requirement to meet the climate change risks in the agriculture and allied sector13 preliminary estimates indicate that india would need around usd 206 billion at 2014 15 prices between 2015 and 2030

opportunities and ch allenges iii increasing farmers income 1 structural transformation of agricul ture sector as all of you are aware indian agriculture is going through the process of structural transformation over the years the decline in agricultures contribution to gdp has been faster than the percentage of population dependent on the agriculture sector this has generated a trend of pauperization of indian farmers presently agriculture contributes about 14 of the gdp but more than 50 of the population are still dependent on the agriculture sector for livelihood this has led to largescale unemployment under employment and to what professor nurkse calls disguised unemployment 2 declining profitability income from farming further farming in india is characterized by small and fragmented holdings and high dependence on monsoon rains operating small holdings is often unviable and farming is not a profitable business or enterprise farmers earn income from various sources viz crop cultivation horticulture dairy poultry fisheries other allied activities non farm activities and wage employment during the last 30 years the income disparity between farmers and non farmers has increased in 1983 84 the average income of a farm household used to be about a third of that of a nonfarm household by the year 2004 05 this statistic had reduced to onefourth there was some improvement d uring the subsequent period up to 2013 14 due to agriculture growth research based analyses of income estimates for farmers are limited some of the prominent studies were by sen and bhatia 200414 dholakia et al 201415 and chand et al 201516 as per chand et als estimate the real income grew at the compounded rate of 394 per cent per annum during 2004 05 to 2011 12 which is the fastest compared to previous two decades based on the trends in farm income from 1983 84 till 2011 12 chand et al 201 5 concluded that o the income earned by farmers net of input cost and wage bill has seen low and high growth paths in different periods 14 sen abhijit and ms bhatia 2004 cost of cultivation and farm income state of the indian farmer a millennium study new delhi academic

agriculture in the c urrent cont ext opportunities and ch allenges o the growth in farm income accelerated during the recent period o decent growth in farm income requires high growth in output favorable farm produce prices and some cultivators moving out of agriculture to non farm activities the major source of information on income of farmers based on large sample survey is situation assessment survey sas by nsso conducted during 200 203 for the first time and repeated during 2012 13 these surveys indicate that th e average total income of farm households increased by 1175 per cent per annum from rs 25320 in 2002 03 to rs 77112 in nominal terms the largest share of farmers income was from cultivation which increased from 46 per cent in 2002 03 to 48 per cent in 2012 13 this was followed by wages and salaries the share of which declined from 39 per cent to 32 per cent during the same period contribution of livestock to farmer s income increased from 4 per cent to 12 per cent the share of income from non farm sector declined from 11 per cent to 8 per cent real income of farmers calculated on the basis of gdp deflator showed a real growth rate of 524 per cent during the peri od 2002 03 to 2012 13 this implies that while farmers nominal income doubled in 6 years real income took 14 years to double the growth rates in nominal income of farm households across major states of the country varied from 671 per cent in west beng al to 1748 per cent in haryana nominal income doubling time is 8 to 11 years for states like assam bihar jk jharkhand and west bengal for all other states doubling time for nominal income is around 6 years or less however the lowest real growth rate recorded was less than one per cent in assam and the highest was 981 per cent for madhya pradesh the doubling time is beyond 10 years for all states barring andhra pradesh madhya pradesh odisha and rajasthan further if the consumer price index for agricultural labourers is used the annual growth rate of real income for farmers falls to 35 per cent with this growth rate farmers income will double in 20 years the honble finance minister in his union budget speech 2016 17 had highlighted the need to think beyond food security of the country to focus on income security of the farmer he had accordingly announced the target of doubling farmers income 3 strategies for enhancing farmers income the strategy for enhancing farmer s income has to be designed based on the local agro climatic and socio economic parameters however a highly generalized strategy is diagrammatically represented below 14 p a g e agriculture in the c urrent cont ext opportunities and ch allenges some interventions for enhancing farmers income could be 31 enhancing production through yield increase this includes adoption of recommendedimproved agronomic practices adoption of improved technologies farm mechanization planning profitable crop mix that can maximize aggregate income reducing crop losses through integrated pest management varietal improvement through conventional breeding or biotechnology long term 32 leveraging water resources for enhancing farm incomes adoption of drip sprinklers watershed management conjunct ive use of water agronomic practices such as soil additives and mulching system of rice intensification sri rainwater harvesting farm ponds water users associations 33 income enhancement through diversification diversification towards high value c rops diversification towards livestock poultry and fisheries and other feasible allied livelihood activities supplementary and complementary non farm activities especially for small holders who do not possess adequate land enhancing farmers income enhance gross income reduce costs stabilize income reduce risks production growth higher price realization diversify farm non farm harness complement arities reduce purchased inputs 1 coping mechanisms 2 insurance 3 expand irrigation cover 15 p a g e agriculture in the c urrent cont ext opportunities and ch allenges 34 reducing cost s through low input agriculture organic farming low external input sustainable agriculture precision farming etc may be promot ed with a view to reducing cost of cultivation 35 promotion of integrated farming system approach promotion of integrated farming sys tem approach involving synergic blending of crops horticulture dairy fisheries poultry etc 36 popularization of i nnovative farming techniques popularizing adoption of innovative farming technologies like sri ssi protective cultivation methods like greenhouse poly house etc for productivityincome enhancement and risk management 37 agri enterprise agriculture has to be seen as an enterprise the farmer an entrepreneur and the goal income profitability enhancement as opposed to productivity enhancement the farmer can increase his income through value addition in the form of grading sorting processing packaging and marketing ie functioni ng as an agri entrepreneur agro processing and agri entrepreneurship offers enormous potential for income enhancement to indian farmers 38 producer organization s india has over 125 crore farmer households of which over 85 are small and marginal farmers with land holdings of less than 2 hectares the average size of land holding is 116 hectare farmer household due to this fragmentation and disorganization farmers face issues of procuring inputs like se eds and fertilizers at reasonable prices they are also unable to realize good value from their marketable surplus by individually selling their produce farmers coming together under the platform of producer organization s can aggregate their produce and t hus reap the benefit of economics of scale in the entire supply chain in the form of lower input price and higher price realization better access to market and credit organizing farmers into producer organization s has the potential to catapult indian agriculture from subsistence farming to commercial farming through the vehicle of aggregation 37 income enhancement through professionalization providing training and skill transfer to farmers can be very useful in enhancing the income of farmers 38 risk management taking insurance cover for crops providing weather price market advisories 16 p a g e agriculture in the c urrent cont ext opportunities and ch allenges exante adaptation strategies such as investing in wells mixed farming sharecropping stocking grains expost strategies like replanting changing input use and thinning the standing crop etc price stabilization mechanisms such as building bonds with commission agentstraders entering into contracts etc 4 initiatives by government of india as there are complementarities in the measures and initiatives taken by the goi in meeting the above mentioned challenges i have taken the liberty of briefly highlighting some of the major policy interventions initiated by the goi in a combined fashion the government of india is committed to accord high priority to water conservation and its management to this effect the pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy has been formulated with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation har khet ko pani and improving water use efficiency more crop per drop in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation distribution management field application and extension activities the paramparagat krishi vikas yojana pkvy is an initia tive to promote organic farming in the country and was launched by the government in 2015 the soil health card scheme was launched by the government in february 2015 with the objective of issuing crop wise recommendations of nutrients and fertilizers required for the indi vidual farms to help farmers improve productivity through judicious use of inputs similarly neem coated urea is being promoted to regulate the use of urea enhance its availability to the crop and cut on cost the national mission for sustainable agriculture nmsa has been formulated for enhancing agricultural productivity especially in rainfed areas focusing on integrated farming water use efficiency soil health management and synergizing resource conservation the rainfed area de velopment rad programme adopt s an area based approach for development and conservation of natural resources along with farming systems national agriculture market nam is a pan india electronic trading portal which networks the existing apmc mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities the nam portal provides a single window service for all apmc related information and services this includes commodity arrivals prices buy sell trade offers provision to respond to trade offers among other services while material flow agriculture produce continue s to happen through mandis an online market reduces transaction costs and information asymmetry 17 p a g e agriculture in the c urrent cont

sustainable production in the agriculture sector by way of providing compensation to farmers suffering crop lossdamage arising out of unforeseen events stabili zing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices and ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector attributing to food security crop diversification and enhan cing growth and competitiveness of the agriculture sector besides protecting farmers from production risks all loanee farmers including share croppers and tenant farmers are compulsorily covered under the scheme the union government has set an ambitiou s target to increase insurance coverage from 23 of the gross cropped area gca to 50 of gca within the next 2 3 years 5 initiatives by nabard for sustainable development 51 watershed development nabard entered into watershed d evelopment activities through the kf w assisted pilot project under the indo german watershed development programme igwdp in the year 1992 in maharashtra wherein the participatory approach of watershed development was launched in india for the first time subsequently the initiatives were then extended to other states under the igwdp to demonstrate the success of the participatory watershed development interventions carried out by nabard under the igwdp programme the watershed development fu nd wdf was set up in nabard during 1999 2000 with an initial corpus of 200 crore by the goi and nabard in equal proportion s the fund has been augmented over the years by way of interest differential earned under ridf and interest accrued on the unutilised portion of the fund as on march 2017 600 watershed projects are under implementation in various stages in 19 states and 1275 watershed projects have been completed successfully the cumulative sanction under all watershed programmes stands at rs174563 crore out of which an amount of rs150782 crore has been released so far covering an area of 1902 lakh ha 52 tribal development nabard has been closely associated with the implementation of kfw germany sponsored wadi programme s targeting the poor tribal families in gujarat and maharashtra the model has been found to be very effective in creating sustainable livelihoods for tribal families in order to support similar deserving tribal families in other parts of the country naba rd has 18 p a g e agriculture in the c urrent cont ext opportunities and ch allenges created a dedicated fund called tribal development fund tdf by making a contribution of 50 crore the fund was operationalised from 01st april 2004 and is being augmented from time to time the fund is being used as grantloan to support wadi development and other sustainable micro enterprises undertaken by tribal families the cumulative sanction under the tribal development fund tdf stood at rs 202984 crore as on 31 march 2017 while disbursement stood at rs 134031 crore covering 503 lakh families with 673 projects across 27 states and union territories adivasi development programme nabard has also successfully implemented adivasi development programmes i n maharashtra and gujarat with financial assistance from the german government a total of 19000 families have been assisted under the programmes with an amount of 110 crore 53 producer organisation s nabard with assistance from produce fund has promoted over two thousand farmer producer organizations fpos in 28 states across the country swornajyoti producer company ltd spcl was started by tribal women farmers of koraput district in odisha in 2014 with an aim to promote liv estock based livelihood activities among marginal farmers by increasing market accessibility and improving farmers share on production the company sells poultry birds in the brand name adisha chicken within one year spcl has been able to achieve a tu rnover of 553 lakhs 54 technology transfer promotion of system of rice intensification sri sustainable sugarcane initiative ssi in convergence with the national food security mission nfsm nabard had launched the programme for promotion of s ystem of rice intensification sri through transfer of technology covering 84000 farmers and 84000 acres over a period of three years the programme was launched during kharif 2010the total financial outlay of programme was 2568 crore and was implemented across 13 identified states by the end of the project period 142 lakh farmers were covered under the programme encompassing a total area of 3693561 ha under the sustainable sugarcane initiative ssi initiative nabard has sanctioned project s in bihar to support farmers to adopt the ssi cultivation method and improve their production and productivity 19 p a g e agriculture in the c
