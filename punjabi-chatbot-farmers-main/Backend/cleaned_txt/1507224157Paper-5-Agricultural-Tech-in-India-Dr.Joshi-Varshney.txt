message academic research can inform policy making however since each piece of research may cover certain aspects of an issue a comprehensive review of research may help collate the findings that may lead to policy recommendations further the research available may be often very technical and less communicative to the policy makers nabard commenced the research and policy series to commission review papers on various themes to bring research findings on a given theme in a capsule form with this series veteran scholars in different fields of specialisation have been r equested to document research in their field highlighting various issues policy relevance and prescriptions and suggestions for future research i am glad to present the paper on agricultural technologies in india a review by dr p k joshi who has been an authority on the subject dr deepak varshney has coauthored the paper the series will present more such authoritative papers on various issues ranging from climate change to agricultural policy in the coming months i hope that series will be beneficial to academicians researchers and policy makers for use at the ground level my best wishes to the authors and the department of economic analysis and research dear for initiating such a wonderful series dr g r chintala iiiii foreword there is a vast body of research available on topics related to agriculture and rural development in the academic world but most of it is in the technical realm and not in a form which could feed into the policy research must first lead to better understanding of a subject and then into a robust policy wherever it can so that it touches the multitude of indians across the length and breadth of our country through better public policy and efficient services discussion with my colleagues on this issue leads to this new series research policy we wish that this series will provide the breadth and depth of research into an area topped up by a lucid presentation for the policy makers i am happy to present the fifth publication in this series on agricultural technologies in india a review written by dr p k joshi and dr deepak varshney i wish this new series acts as a bridge between the researchers and policy makers p v s suryakumar deputy managing director ivv preface agriculture sector proved a silver lining in the pandemic period registering a positive growth i n the covid times yet it faces various structural challenges to be addressed to make it profitable for the majority of the population is still dependent on the sector as we all know investing in research is one of the best strategies to address problems of agriculture equally important is to communicate the research findings to policy makers to design and tweak policies that matter during one of our meetings with shri p v s suryakumar our dmd we had loud thinking if we can commission a few review papers on a select themes we thought that it is appropriate to request veteran scholars who spent prime of their life on a given research theme to attempt such a work where they will distil their understanding and the research done on the theme in a short paper duly encouraged by dmd and chairman we wrote to a dozen eminent scholars and the response was overwhelming resulting in department of economic analysis and research dear the research wing of nabard initiating the research and policy series the motivation is thus to get a few handles from research that can help effective policy intervention this series will be useful to policy makers and researchers alike the research and policy series is an attempt to get a glimpse of hardcore research findings in a capsule form thereby making it more effective and communicative to policy makers the group of researchers who agreed to prepare a review of research have spent their life in the field of agricultural research our purpose here as we communicated to them was not just to get literature survey but to get researchers heart and their experience which they gained during their long passionate innings the paper is expected to highlight various issues policy relevance prescription and suggestion for future papers on the themes of interest to nabard throughout history technological innovations have had a significant impact on agriculture at a time when policy debates are still centred on the agricultural sectors low and stagnant income the current paper on agricultural technologies in india a review written by dr p k joshi former director south asia international food vi policy research institute ifpri washington dc and dr deepak varshney assistant professor at the development planning centre institute of economic growth new delhi assumes importance dr joshi and dr varshney have a distinguished academic career with research interests in technology policy market and institutional economics this paper aims to analyse the level of adoption pattern of different technologies as well as the constraints in scaling up these technologies across various commodities and geographies it goes on to highlight key conditions for the successful adoption and implementation of agricultural technologies and how these technologies have impacted farmers income natural resource management input use efficiencies employment generation and so on the paper uses crosscountry evidence to demonstrate how investments in agricultural research and development have enormous potential it also impresses on the rate of return on investments in various agricultural sectors finally the authors discuss how the agricultural research policies should be taken forward to address emerging agricultural challenges overall the paper provides readers with food for thought in bringing this series as planned we would like to express our sincere gratitude to dr g r chintala chairman nabard for his inspiring leadership unstinted support and guidance we also wish to express our sincere thanks to shri p v s suryakumar dmd for being the inspiration and the driving force behind the publication of this first of its kind series we are grateful to the authors of this series who agreed to write on themes relevant to nabard in such a short period of time indeed it has been a great privilege for us i also acknowledge the contributions of the officers of dear nabard especially dr ashutosh kumar dgm mrs geeta acharya manager

precision farming project wtp willingness to pay xvii executive summary agriculture sector in india is a primary source of livelihood for a majority of the population low and stagnant income in the sector remains a focal point of policy debate in india the most prominent pathways to enhance farmers income is the adoption of improved agricultural technologies this study documents the current state of agriculture technologies in india the main objectives are a what are the adoption levels of improved technologies and their impact on farmers income agricultural production natural resources and environment b what are the constraints in upscaling improved technologies and the conditions for success of their adoption c what are the rate of return on agriculture research and extension system and d what can be learnt from the global perspective on agriculture research and extension services the study includes the technologies related to i genetic enhancement ii natural resource management iii farm mechanisation iv conservation agriculture v climate smart agriculture vi biotechnology and genetic modification vii biofortification viii frontier technologies and ix digital technologies it shows that the adoption of improved technologies varied across technologies commodities and geography adoption of improved technologies have shown an unambiguous positive impact on agricultural productivity and agricultural production more specifically these have had an impact on increasing farmers income income diversification conserving natural resources improving input use efficiencies generating employment opportunities and promoting diversification at the same time defective policies and incentives have led to degradation of natural resources especially a fall in water table and deterioration of soil health demand and supply side factors such as extension credit human capital technology traits institutional barriers and enabling environment play a crucial role in the adoption of improved technologies small and fragmented size of land holdings the education level of the farmers access to knowledge systems and availability of irrigation also determine adoption of improved technologies therefore land consolidation through institutional reforms connecting farmers with technology delivery systems and markets and strengthening agricul tural credit system are to be addressed for a faster and wider adoption of improved technologies xviii recent studies on agriculture extension highlight the salient role of targeting based approaches including social networks for the faster adoption of improved technologies there is a need to connect farmers in a network mode with a targeted approach by taking farmers aspirations and needs it is suggested that the social networking should be a part of the strategy for promoting improved technologies the study also notes that a perfect symphony is needed amongst technology traits policies institutions and infrastructure for the accelerated adoption of improved technologies the study highlights key conditions for the successful adoption and implemen tation of improved agricultural technologies which includes an effective agriculture extension system access to credit human capital and direct benefit transfers to enable small and marginal farmers for easy access to information and credit the role of public sector programmes such as krishi vigyan kendras kvks and the kisan credit card kcc scheme are crucial education and skill development matter for all aspects of technological interventions starting from the choice of technology to its appropriate implementation social safety nets such as pmkisan can play an instrumental role in providing assistance to marginal and small farmers to improve the investment capacity of farmers to achieve the longterm goals of farmers welfare investment in agricultural research and extension significantly contribute to increasing productivity and agricultural growth in india for instance the recent studies on the returns of frontline extension system reveal a very high benefitcost ratio of 8 to 12 but the agriculture spending in agricultural research and extension in india is much lower compared to the neighbouring and competing countries especially china this largely explains the slow agricultural growth in the country compared to china the crosscountry evidence highlights that the investment in the agriculture research and development have a huge potential in gaining the marginal returns therefore there is a need to strategize the investment in agriculture research and extension to generate and disseminate improved technologies to different agro climatic regions emerging challenges such as climate change degradation of natural resources and undernourishment need a different approach and higher research resources it appears that future agricultural research would be more capital intensive which would require modern tools infrastructure and upgraded skills nextgeneration technolo gies such as climate smart agriculture frontier technologies and digital agriculture xix require a different approach in technology generation and their dissemination there is a need to reform the agricultural research and extension system by allocating more financial resources improving capacity of human resources creating an enabling management structure promoting multidisciplinary and multi institutional research strengthening publicprivate partnership and developing appropriate research infrastructure xxagricultural
