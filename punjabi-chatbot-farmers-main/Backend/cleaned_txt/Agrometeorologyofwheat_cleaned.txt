nearly 70 of wheat to the central pool of food grains and hence is commonly referred to as the bread basket of the country climate and weather variability especially temperature significantly affect potential wheat yield in punjab a better understanding of weather resources can help to increase crop productivity it will enhance the benefits by minimizing losses due to adverse weather conditions several scientists reported implications of climate change for india and concluded that wheat production is estimated to decrease there has been an increase in the frequency of extreme events and climate change poses major threat to the sustainability of agriculture the past two decades have witnessed globally a rapid increase in the awareness about climatic changes and triggered widespread apprehension amongst scientists and governments about their global implications on wheat crop therefore it becomes important to examine various regions to device more effective policies for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change during the heading and flowering stages excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful to wheat unusual changes in weather parameters especially an increase in temperature from normal at important growth stages of crop adversely affects the growth and ultimately the potential yield of wheat understanding the regional and local dimensions of vulnerability is essential to develop appropriate and targeted adaptation efforts the technical bulletin agrometeorology of wheat in punjab state of india brought out by aicrp on agrometeorology ludhiana centre gain significance in this context the objective of this publication is to provide useful background information for scientists as well as policy makers who are interested in understanding the impacts of climate on wheat crop in irrigated punjab state and to devise suitable adaptation options i trust that this publication will provide a good basis for the different stakeholders scientists extension specialist industry and policy planners i congratulate the team members for bringing out this useful publication at this crucial time when wheat crop is suffering from extreme weather events like terminal heat stress and climate change etc in northwest india including the state of indian punjab balwinder singh director of research punjab agricultural university ludhiana 141 004 india 89preface the technical bulletin agrometeorology of wheat in punjab state of india is a compilation of the research studies made on cropweather relationship on wheat by ludhiana centre of the aicrp on agrometeorology and other associated projects growth development and yield of a crop is a result complex interactive relationship between soilplantatmosphere system wheat is the most important cereal food crop of the punjab state and its productivity is highly dependent upon the prevailing weather conditions in this bulletin we have presented the major agrometeorological constraints on wheat production and the salient results of the interactions of long term crop and weather data the footprints of climate change and variability are evident in the state the results of the simulation studies using the hypothetical climate change scenarios as well as precis model simulated scenarios of climate change and their effect on wheat indicate that adaptation and mitigation strategies may help in stabilizing the sharp decreases in the wheat yield we thank dr balwinder singh director of research p au ludhiana for his keen interest in agrometeorological research and scripting the foreword to this bulletin in spite of his extremely busy schedule the compilation of this bulletin would not have happened without the inspiring attitude of dr v umamaheswara rao project coordinator aicrp am we profusely thank him for guiding us as well as the thorough screening the draft of this publication to make it more meaningful and useful we take this opportunity to express gratefulness to dr s s hundal professor retd and former head of the department of agricultural meteorology p au for his research contributions in the publication and critical reviewing of the bulletin i heartily express my appreciation to all the coauthors for their efforts and valuable inputs without which drafting of this bulletin would not be possible prabhjyot kaur1chapter 1 introduction 11 origin of wheat wheat is one of the first plants to be domesticated and cultivated by humans possibly between 18000 and 12000 bc initially wheat cultivation flourished in the fertile crescent region of the tigris and euphrates rivers since domestication wheat production has dramatically expanded and it is the secondmost produced crop on the earth lagging behind only corn keeping in mind the agricultural importance of wheat crop as a major cereal food crop in punjab state the information on the wheat crop collected under the icar sponsored research project all india coordinated research project on agrometeorology was analyzed and compiled to bring forth an aggregated research bulletin on the agrometeorology of wheat in punjab state of india 12 importance of wheat wheat is the dominant crop in temperate countries being used for human food and livestock feed its success depends partly on its adaptability and high yield potential but also on the gluten protein fraction which impart the viscoelastic properties that allow dough to be processed into bread pasta noodles and other food products whole grain wheat products also contribute essential amino acids minerals vitamins beneficial photochemical and dietary fibres to the human diet it is the most important staple food of about two billion people 36 of the world population worldwide wheat provides nearly 55 of the carbohydrates and 20 of the food calories consumed globally breiman and graur 1995 13 geographical distribution wheat crop is most successful between the latitudes of 30 and 60n and 27 and 40s wheat can also be grown beyond these limits from within the arctic circle and at higher elevations near the equator in altitude the crop is grown from sea level to more than 3000 msl while it has also been reported at 4570 msl in tibet the major wheat producing countries are china india usa the russian federation and australia these five countries together contribute more than half of the global wheat production india was the second largest wheat producing nation and contributes approximately 1183 7760 million tonnes to the world wheat production from about 1250 2782 million hectares of global area during 20092010 fao 2010 in india uttar pradesh madhya pradesh and punjab are important states from the point of both area and production 214 climatic requirements wheat is grown not only in tropical and subtropical zones but also in the temperate zones between 47s and 57n latitude from sea level to an elevation of 3300 m it can tolerate severe cold and snow and resumes growth with the onset of warm weather in spring in india its cultivation is spread between 10n to 37n latitudes fieldman 2001 the optimum temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 2025c however the seed can germinate in the temperature range of 3535c for vegetative growth 1622c is the optimum temperature temperatures above 25c during this period tend to decrease grain weight photo periodically wheat is a long day plant it requires photoperiod of more than a critical length which may vary from 14 to 18 hours pandey and sinha 2006 wheat can be grown successfully in those regions where annual rainfall varies from 25 to 150 cm a well distributed winter rainfall of 1520 cm is required for rainfed cropping rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight the areas with a warm and damp climate are not suitable for wheat cultivation wheat plant requires medium 5060 humidity for growth but requires less humidity at the time of maturity cloudy weather with high humidity and low temperature is conducive to rust attack 15 soil requirements wheat is grown in a wide variety of soils but it is most suited to fertile welldrained medium textured loamy to clay loam a good crop of wheat can also be raised in sandy loams and black soils however too sandy and poorly drained soils clay 60 are not suitable for wheat soil should be neutral 68 ph in reaction under dry conditions heavy soils with good drainage are best owing to their better moisture retention properties soils with electrical conductivity of saturation extract 6 dsm and exchangeable sodium percentage 40 are not suitable for economical yields the soil depth should be greater than 25 cm for wheat cultivation 16 nutritional importance of wheat wheat contains more protein 815 grain 813 flour than other cereals wheat proteins are of special significance besides their significance in nutrition these are principally concerned with providing the characteristic substance gluten which is very essential for bakers in south asia it is mostly eaten in the form of chapaties besides wheat is also consumed in various other forms such as poories dalia halwa sweet meals etc in areas where rice is the staple food wheat is used in the form of upmaor poories wheat is also used for manufacturing of bread flakes cakes biscuits etc wheat straw makes good source of feed for livestock317 wheat growing zones in india india is divided into following six major wheat growing agroclimatic zones 171 the northwestern plains zone nwp z this zone covers subhumid alluvial and arid western plains of delhi jammu and kathua districts of jammu kashmir and una district and paonta valley parts of himachal pradesh tarai region of uttarakhand haryana punjab rajasthan except kota and udaipur divisions and western uttar pradesh

2 agroclimatic characterization 21 area production and productivity of wheat globally wheat is grown on an area of about 22170 million hectares in a wide range of environment with an annual production of about 6558 million tonnes india is the second largest wheat producing nation where area under wheat was 3119 million hectares with production of 9585 million tonnes and yield of 315 tonnes per hectares during 201314 in punjab it occupied an area of 351 million hectares with a production of 1659 million tonnes and productivity of 498 tonnes per hectares during 201213 anonymous 2014 during this period the area under wheat crop was maximum in sangrur 0285 million hectares followed by ludhiana and bathinda 0254 million hectares districts fig 21 the productivity of wheat crop ranged between 4469 kgha gurdaspur district to 5498 kgha sangrur district 22 decadal changes in area production and productivity of wheat in punjab in punjab state a significant increase in area production and productivity of wheat over the past four decades ie 197071 to 20092010 was noticed in all the districts of the state table 21 prabhjyotkaur et al 2006 the results of the analysis revealed that on an average over the past forty crop years 197071 to 20092010 maximum increase in area was in district amritsar 175 the improvement in production was more than 50 in districts of gurdaspur amritsar hoshiarpur ropar ferozepur bathinda sangrur and patiala 92 86 55 66 76 6 74 and 59 respectively likewise improvement in productivity was of significant magnitude ie 40 in districts of hoshiarpur patiala gurdaspur ropar bathinda amritsar sangrur and ferozepur 50 49 48 46 46 41 40 and 40 respectively over the past forty crop years 197071 to 20092010 in ludhiana district the mean increase in area 12 and productivity 25 was least as it has always been the most technologically advanced district of the state 23 trend analysis of historical wheat yield in punjab the past actual yields crop year 19071 to 201213 for different locations in the state were regressed against time to develop a linear predictive model to assess the rate at which wheat yields have increased over time due to advancement in technology the actual interseasonal variation in yield would presumably be due to a combination of variations in weather conditions and fluctuations in the degree to which the farmers practices and wheat crop varieties are optimized during each crop season overall there is a significant increase in the wheat yields in punjab prabhjyotkaur and hundal 2009 the rate of increase in wheat yields over the past 42 years was highest in patiala 738 kghayear followed by bathinda 6685 kghayear sangrur 677 kghayear gurdaspur 663 kghayear hoshiarpur 635 kghayear ferozepur 623 kghayear amritsar and jalandhar 617 kghayear ropar 607 kghayear and lowest in ludhiana 523 kghayear the wheat yields during 1970s decade in all districts of punjab except ludhiana were less than 3000 kgha because ludhiana was technologically advanced district than other districts 23 climatic characterization during wheat growing season in punjab the historical meteorological data for different locations in the state were analyzed to work out the normals for the wheat growing season extending from standard meteorological week number 43 to 13 during the months of november to march for wheat crop appendix i to vi the distribution of rainfall during this wheat growing period is very skewed in the state ie the northeastern parts of the state receive rainfall within 9 11 rainy days 105 160 mm and the dry south western parts of the state receive rainfall within 5 7 rainy days 67 80 mm the normal monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature maximum relative humidity minimum relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed are within the range of 170 283 oc 36 204oc 73 95 36 54 49 86 hourday and 28 47 kmhr respectively during the months of november through march for wheat crop 24 climatic variability analysis in punjab wheat crop in punjab state is sown within sowing windows early 2nd fortnight october normal 1st to 3rd week november and late 4th week november to mid december and harvested during the april month 241 variability on annual and wheat growing rabi season basis the variability trends for annual and wheat growing rabi season meteorological parameters for different locations in punjab are shown in table 22 in general the annual maximum temperature increased at ne punjab ballowal saunkhri central punjab jalandhar and patiala and sw punjab bathinda the annual and wheat growing rabi season minimum temperatures have increased at central punjab ludhiana jalandhar and patiala and sw punjab bathinda the maximum and minimum relative humidity revealed a significant increasing trend and sunshine hours and evaporation a significant decreasing trend at ne punjab ballowal saunkhri and central punjab ludhiana 242 variability on monthly basis the variability trends for meteorological data on monthly basis during wheat growing season for different locations in punjab are given in table 23 prabhjyotkaur et al 2013 the perusal of data revealed that the maximum temperature has increased at ne punjab ballowal saunkhri during all months except january in central punjab it has 7increased during februarymarch ludhiana november februaryapril patiala and april amritsar in sw punjab it shows increasing trend in march month the minimum temperature has increased during all months of the year at ludhiana november march jalandhar february march patiala and february bathinda it has decreased during the months of january ballowal saunkhri and amritsar and december amritsar and bathinda thereby indicating increase in incidence of low temperature events in winter season in the state the winter season rainfall shows increasing 25 favourable range of monthly temperatures for high wheat yield analysis of the temperatures during january february and march was done and average wheat yield corresponding to particular range of maximum and minimum temperatures for these three months for various locations over a decade crop years 200001 to 201011 are presented in table 24 the analysis revealed that maximum temperature in the range of 161180 oc during january 210oc during february and 281300oc during march were most favourable for optimum wheat yield prabhjyotkaur and hundal 2009 similarly the minimum temperature in the range of 3150 oc during january 5170oc during february and 111130oc during march were most favourable for wheat yield in the region 26 agrometeorological constraints for wheat in punjab temperature is one of the main environmental factor that influences the growth and yield of winter season crops under irrigated conditions in punjab any deviation especially increase in temperature throughout the growth of wheat adversely affects their potential productivity in wheat high temperature during early growth period results in poor tillering retarded vegetative growth and early heading within the season itself warmer temperatures shorten the vegetative crop duration high temperature at ripening stage leads to premature ripening 261 terminal heat stress in wheat heat stress is an important constraint to wheat productivity affecting different growth stages specially anthesis and grain filling indian wheat yields were also observed to be more prone to shortterm temperature extremes lobell et al 2012 senescence gets accelerated due to heat extremes above and beyond the influence of increased average temperatures for instance a sudden rise in temperature during march 2010 caused significant wheat yield reductions over the indogangetic plains igp gupta et al 2010 a study by teixeira et al 2013 has been placed the northern part of indian subcontinent that includes igp under high risk zone for heat stress risk in future climates this calls for a better understanding of the impacts of increased mean seasonal temperatures especially minimum or night temperature nagarajan et al 2010 as well as impacts of short term extreme temperatures wheeler et al 2000 8 source anonymous 2014

decade 199091 to 1999200010terminal heat stress is a major reason of yield decline in wheat due to delayed planting and is a major challenge to wheat productivity in india joshi et al 2007 a recent study by rao et al 2015 conducted on analysing the sensitivity of wheat yields to temperature in india have revealed that the wheat yields appear to be becoming more sensitive to minimum temperature tn especially during postanthesis period mean wheat yields for the period 19802011 declined by 7 204 kg ha1 for a 1c rise in tn exposure to continual tn exceeding 12c for 6 days and terminal heat stress with maximum temperature tx exceeding 34c for 7 days during postanthesis period are the other thermal constraints in achieving high productivity therefore there is a need to develop genotypes that are either tolerant to terminal heat stress or that mature early without yield losses and thus escape the stress stay green is a trait that has been used to indicate heat tolerance in hot environment kohli et al1991 for indian conditions ricewheat crop rotation is a common practice and when long duration rice cultivars are planted they lead to late sowing of wheat and therefore expose it to the risk of terminal heat stress hence the adaptation of the methodology of minimumtillage in the ricewheat system allows the wheat to emerge earlier and avoid exposure of the reproductive stage to extreme heat episodes thereby heat stress could be mitigated joshi et al 2007 biswas et al 2008 agricultural practices such as shifting of sowing time and changing the cultivars maybe some of the regional adaptation strategies to minimize the overall impact of rising and extreme temperatures on wheat productivity 262 impact of cold and heat wave on wheat yield a case study according to india meteorological department heat wave is defined as the departure of the temperature from the normal by 5 to 6 oc similarly cold wave is defined as the departure of the temperature from the normal by 5 to 6 oc the daily data for maximum and minimum temperature during the wheat crop season at ludhiana 24th october to 15th april were analyzed on the basis of 7 days moving average the wheat yield for ludhiana district reported in the statistical abstracts of the state for the crop years 20002011 was selected for the analysis amongst these ten crop years the crop year 200304 wheat yield 4747 kg ha 1 and 200809 wheat yield 4392 kg ha1 were identified as heat wave years figure 22 and 23 aicrpamludhiana 2011 the perusal of the data revealed that during these two heat wave years the maximum and minimum temperatures were invariably above normal within the range of 05 to 50oc during the whole crop periods a consistently high temperature heat wave during the february march period reduces the grain development period and ultimately the yield the cold wave crop years figure 24 and 25 identified were 201011 wheat yield 4964 kg ha1 and 201112 wheat yield 5342 kg ha1 during these years the maximum and minimum temperature were either normal or appreciably below normal within the range of 05 to 40 oc during the tiller development as well as grain development phase the below 11table 22

wheat productivity in india and as an example analyzed the yields of ludhiana district indian punjab over a 12 year period 2000 to 2012 8 years were normal two each were with heat and cold waves aicrpamludhiana 2012 the diurnal variations or cyclicity in minimum and maximum temperatures spectrum was analyzed into spectral density values to evaluate the impact of recent cold wave on wheat productivity in punjab during rabi 201011 the temperature was significantly below normal during early vegetative phases tillering flowering and maturity which maintained greenness and higher productivity fig 26 during rabi 201112 the temperature was statistically significantly below normal after mid december and its phases of above and below normal alternated with greater number and higher intensity peaks of low temperature extending towards flowering and seed formation stage cold wave conditions that prevailed during rabi 20102011 and 20112012 coincided with flowering and seed formation stage of wheat their spectral density analysis indicated that temperature during wheat growing seasons of 20102011 and 20112012 were significantly lower than normal they noticed an average yield loss of 217 kg ha 1 45 during a heat wave year and a gain of 356 kg ha1 74 during a cold wave year between the two recent continuous cold wave years productivity gain in the punjab state in the relatively colder year 20112012 was higher by 400 kg ha1 27 yield gap analysis for wheat historical data on actual yield of wheat crop for the period of 19992009 was collected from statistical

within the range of 889 to 35021chapter 3 crop weather relationships in wheat 31 phenological stages of wheat wheat crop is sown from last week of october for long duration cultivars up to end of november for short duration cultivars in punjab its entire crop growth period is about 128158 days depending on the variety life cycle of wheat can be divided into following phenological stages fig 31 stage 1seedling stage the first stage of growth in wheat is called the seedling stage this stage occurs after germination and begins when the first true leaves emerge from the soil and ends when the first tiller emerges during the seedling stage the second leaves are just emerging and beginning to unroll and there are as many as six seminal roots stage 2tillering stage tillers are new shoots that emerge from the root of the plant each tiller can grow its own stalk and ear so the number of tillers will determine the potential yield of the plant tillering can occur either before or after the winter dormancy stage in winter wheat stage 3jointing stage the jointing stage starts when the stalk forms its second node a hard joint from which the plant telescopes upwards during the jointing stage the smaller lessformed tillers often die off it is important that all the wheat plants in a field reach the jointing stage at the same time so that all the heads mature at same time stage 4booting stage during the booting stage the head of the wheat develops and becomes visible beneath the sheath on the stalk the booting stage ends when the tips of the head called awns begin to emerge from the sheath stage 5heading and flowering stage the heading and flowering stage begins when the awns emerge from the sheath when the awns have emerged the flowering begins and pollination and fertilization occurs it is important that all the plants in a field flower at the same time right after fertilization the embryo and endosperm begin to form stage 6maturity stage the maturity stage immediately follows fertilization and includes several short stages the milk stage is the first stage and kernel begins to form the kernel is fully formed during the dough stage and the plant takes nutrients from the stalk and leaves and transfers them to 22fig 31 phenological stages of wheat crop 23the kernel the kernel is still very moist at the end of the dough stage and contains about 30 per cent water during the ripening stage the kernel loses the rest of its moisture and is ready to be harvested 32 duration of phenological stages of wheat the phenological stages of wheat are very sensitive to temperature lenka 2006 reported that tolerable range of wheat is 35 to 35oc a temperature regime with a mean maximum of 25oc and a mean minimum of 12oc is considered optimal for grain development in punjab the duration of wheat crop is greatly dependent upon the sowing time which extends from 4th week october to 3rd week november under normal sowing conditions and beyond 4th week november to mid december is the late sown condition the phenological calendar of eight cultivars of wheat viz wl1562 hd2329 wh542 pbw502 pbw 343 pbw550 dbw17 and pbw 621 sown during 2nd forthight of october 1st and 2nd fortnight of november and 1st fortnight of december are presented in tables 31 and 32 pooled datasets of aicrpamludhiana project the growth duration of wheat varies between 146 154 days under mid october to mid november sowing environments the crop sown during 2nd fortnight of november gets nearly 79 days less growth duration of 137145 days for its growth while the growth duration in december sown crop is further curtailed by 710 days growth duration of 124135 days 33 thermal time and phenology of wheat rates of plant developmental processes are determined mainly by temperature and this thermal response is most rapid at the optimum temperature and falls to zero at both the minimum and maximum temperature there are different meteorologically based measures of thermal time designed to estimate crop phenological development the growing degree day gdd thermal units is the daily mean temperature above a base temperature suitable for plant growth and were determined as gdd t max tmin tt 2 where tmax daily maximum temperature oc tmin daily minimum temperature oc tt base temperature of 50 oc were used for wheat the thermal units accrued by eight

crop growth simulation models are being used extensively for predicting growth and yield of crops several such simulation models have been reported in the literature whisler et al 1986 but these being very detailed have large input data requirements and some are very complex to use therefore simplified growth and yield prediction models which have less input data requirement would be quite useful to achieve the required goal agroclimatic models based on thermal indices can play an important role31table 35 agrometeorological indices and yield of wheat cultivars under different sowing

pooled data of rabi 200910 201112 and 20141535371 prediction of maximum leaf area development thermal time based regression models were developed for predicting the leaf area development in wheat the models were based on the concept that daily accumulation of heat units by a crop is the basic driving force for the plant growth the data of three cultivars sown for three crop seasons under aicrpamludhiana project was pooled to derive the predictive models for wheat under different growing environments in punjab the exponential models for the prediction of leaf area development for wheat sown in last week october r 015 first week november r 060 second week november r 050 third week november r 047 fourth week november r 042 and first week december r 031 were able to predict the leaf area development of wheat fig 32 372 prediction of dry matter accumulation the total dry matter accumulated by the crop is directly proportional to the heat units accumulated by the crop these well established relationships are used during the building of the crop models this concept was used to derive the predictive models for wheat under different growing environments in punjab by analysing the data of three cultivars of wheat sown for three crop seasons under the aicrpamludhiana project the exponential models for the prediction of dry matter accumulation for wheat sown in last week october r 086 first week november r 084 second week november r 087 third week november r 086 fourth week november r 086 and first week december r 087 were able to predict the dry matter accumulation fairly well fig 33 hence these thermal time based regression models may be employed for predicting the periodic dry matter accumulation in wheat sown under variable thermal regimes 373 prediction of yield historical weather data maximum and minimum temperature for the past three decades and data on productivity of wheat crop for gurdaspur ballowal saunkhri kapurthala jalandhar ludhiana patiala and bathinda district were analyzed the wheat yield depends largely upon weather parameters during the reproductive phase of the crop the reproductive phase of wheat sown in november under punjab conditions was identified as ranging from 15 th february to 15th april the weather parameters were averaged for the corresponding reproductive phase relationships between maximum and minimum temperature for these seven locations were established using multiple regression analysis table 37 the temperature based yield predictive models were able to explain 75 to 85 of the variation in wheat yields aicrpamludhiana 2002 in punjab temperature data is available for many locations and hence these models can be a useful tool in predicting the wheat yields3638 microclimate studies in wheat the photosynthesis process is a highly inefficient process wherein only 710 of the incident radiation is used in the synthesis of photosynthates during the process of photosynthesis hence the incidence and distribution of radiation into various components play a significant role in the growth and development of a crop the incoming components of radiation short wave are minimum during the early morning and late evening hours and attain a peak during the mid noon hours the incident radiation over the crop canopy is partitioned into three components ie a part of it is reflected albedo a part is transmitted below the crop canopy and the remaining is absorbed interception by the canopy this is the major component of the radiation which is used by the plant within the short wave radiation the radiation between 04 07 m wave band is referred to as photosynthetically active radiation par which is utilized by the plant during the process of photosynthesis the net radiation is the net of incoming and outgoing short wave and long wave radiation 381 diurnal variation in different components of radiation balance the radiation received on the crop canopy is predominantly the short wave radiation within the wave band of 015 40 m the variation in different components of radiation incident short wave radiation along with its interception and albedo par and net radiation during daytime during the maximum tillering stage of wheat crop are given in figure 34 the incident short wave radiation varied from 552 wm2 during morning hours to 390 wm2 during evening hours to a peak of 870 wm2 during the mid noon hours the reflected short wave radiation albedo was maximum during the morning and evening hours 16 17 and minimum 9 10 during the mid noon hours similarly the interception of the radiation was also maximum during the morning and evening hours 70 80 and minimum 55 60 during the mid noon hours the par varied from 100 140 wm2 during morning and evening hours to a peak of 250 300

canopy and the interception was calculated as par incoming par reflected par transmitted par interception x 100 p ar incoming the interception of par was maximum during the early morning and late noon hours however when the sun was directly overhead ie during the mid noon hours the par interception was reduced amongst the different sowing environments during the vegetative phase table 38 the peak interception of par was 80 for 4th week october and 2nd week november sown crop while it was between 6080 for 2nd fortnight november sown wheat aicrpamludhiana 2014 however it was between 4560 for 1st week december sown wheat this variation may be attributed to late and slow development of canopy under delayed sowing environments as the temperature is drastically reduced during the december and january months during the grain development phase in wheat table 39 which starts from mid february onwards as the temperature are high and peak development of canopy has been achieved the peak interception of par was 80 for all the different sowing environments 4 th week october to 1st week december of wheat similarly the minimum interception of par around the mid noon hours was 90 within 4th week october to 2nd week november sown crop and it was between 7085 within 2nd fortnight november to 1st week december sown wheat amongst the four cultivars of wheat crop par interception was maximum in cv wh 1105 and hd2967 as compared to pbw621 and pbw550 this may be attributed to better development of canopy in these wheat cultivars 38 39table 38 diurnal variation of photosynthetically

simulation studies crop simulation models are easy time saving and economical tools for studying the influence of climatic variability on growth and yield of the crops the phenology growth and yield of wheat were simulated with dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer model of cereswheat godwin et al 1990 under modified climatic scenarios the cereswheat model require weather soil and crop data for simulating the crop phenology growth and various yield characteristics the crop data for the study was used from the field experiments conducted under the aicrpam ludhiana project aicrpam ludhiana 2008 hundal and prabhjyotkaur 2007 prabhjyotkaur and hundal 2010 the soil and weather data used in the study were collected from punjab agricultural university ludhiana the simulations were made with the assumption that water and nutrition was non limiting and there were no losses from insectpests on the basis of climatic variability trends observed in the state anticipated synthetic scenarios of increase or decrease from normal temperature interactions of maximum and minimum temperature intraseasonal temperature change solar radiation and carbon dioxide levels were generated for the simulation study one variable at a time was modified and its effect on crop growth and yield was simulated while taking all the other climate variables to be normal the major reason for using incremental variable scenarios is that they capture a wide range of potential changes subsequently the combination of two variables was interactively modified to assess their combination effect on crop growth and yield 41 under variable temperature scenarios the phenological development growth and yield attributes of wheat were simulated when both maximum and minimum temperatures were increased or decreased by 05 10 20 and 30oc from normal while keeping the other climate variables constant phenological development of wheat was significantly advanced by increasing temperature but was delayed by decreasing temperature the growth and yield of wheat was reduced by an increase in temperature but increased with decrease in temperature from normal table 41 with an increase in temperature by 10 to 20 oc the simulated maximum leaf area index lai in wheat decreased by 184 to 292 from normal biomass yield in wheat decreased by 137 to 229 from normal grain yield in wheat decreased by 98 to 180 from normal a decrease in temperature by 10 to 20 oc led to an increase in simulated maximum leaf area index lai in wheat by 116 to 278 from normal simulated biomass yield

10 to 30 oc and maximum temperature decreased by 025 to 10 oc from normal the anthesis and maturity were advanced by upto 8 days from normal the maximum lai biomass yield and grain yield were adversely affected by increasing the minimum temperature from normal however these adverse effects were partially counteracted by decreasing maximum temperature from normal when minimum temperature increased by 10 oc and maximum temperature decreased by 025 to 10 oc from normal the deviations in growth and yield attributes were low and the yields were not affected significantly at further higher levels of increase in minimum temperature by 20 to 30 oc with simultaneous decrease in maximum temperature by 025 oc reductions in maximum lai grain and biomass yield were 162 408 32 63 and 121 160

crop in northern india and it requires cool climate during its early growth stages for potential productivity any abrupt changes in weather parameters especially an increase in maximum minimum temperature from normal at any growth stage of crop adversely affects the growth and ultimately the potential yield of wheat the simulation results revealed that in general an increase in temperature from mid february to mid march severely affected the yield of early normal and late sown wheat table 43 a further scrutiny revealed that the temperature increase mostly affected the early october sown crop during 4 th week of january february and upto 1st fortnight of march the timely november sown crop during february and march the late 4th week of november sown crop during march and very late december sown crop during march and 1st week of april the analysis revealed that an increase of temperature from normal decreased grain yield of wheat table 44 at the following rates temperature

increase or decrease in solar radiation on growth and yield of wheat are shown in table 45 in general increase in solar radiation favoured the growth and yield whereas the decrease in solar radiation favoured reduction in growth and yield of wheat with an increase in solar radiation by 50 the simulated maximum leaf area index lai increased in wheat by 40 from normal biomass yield increased in

radiation levels decreased by 1 25 and 5 from normal the maximum lai decreased respectively in wheat by 192 208 and 232 from normal under same levels of temperature and radiation the grain yield of wheat decreased respectively in wheat by 107 119 and 141 from normal whereas the biomass yield in wheat by 147 161 and 184 from normal the interactive effects of increasing temperature and decreasing radiation revealed a cumulative adverse effect on growth and yield of the wheat crop 46 under elevated temperature and carbon dioxide scenarios the direct effects of increased concentrations of co2 are generally beneficial to vegetation as elevated levels lead to higher assimilation rates the interactive effects of increasing co2 concentration and increasing temperature on wheat growth and yield are depicted in table 47 the results of the simulation study revealed that increasing co2 levels were able to counteract the adverse effects of temperature increase on growth and yield to some extent

have occurred changes in the climatic data over the past four decades in the state keeping this in mind the temperature and rainfall data for the current period and outputs from a regional climate model rcm were used to analyze simulated future climate the future simulated climatic data temperature and rainfall were downscaled using the regional climate model viz precis model providing regional climates for impact studies for different agroclimatic regions ie zone ii ballowal saunkhri zone iii ludhiana amritsar patiala and jalandhar and zone v bathinda of punjab aicrpam ludhiana 2014 the simulated climatic data of temperature and rainfall for the 21st century under different sres scenarios a1b a2 and b2 scenario were corrected by deriving the correction factor by using the actual climate data 19701990 and the baseline data derived from precis model 51 projected changes in meteorological parameters by mid and end 21st century in punjab the precis model for different agroclimatic zones of punjab have simulated that we may experience hotter days and warm nights by the end of 21st century such simulated climate change results in rising incidence of extreme events also the analysis of data fig 51 52 and 53 revealed that the annual maximum and minimum temperature in punjab may increase from the baseline by 22 to 29 oc and 13 to 18 oc respectively by 202050 by 17 to 26 oc and 13 to 16 oc respectively by 20702100 under a1b scenario by 06 to 17 oc and 12 to 17 oc respectively by 20702100 under a2 scenario and by 03 to 12 oc and 02 to 06 oc respectively by 20702100 under b2 scenario similar trend were projected for maximum and minimum temperature on seasonal basis for different locations in punjab state the rainfall scenario was not very clear for different locations in the state the annual rainfall is projected to increase from baseline upto 202050 for ludhiana and decrease from baseline at remaining locations in the state during the period 20702100 under a1b scenario the rainfall is projected to increase from baseline at nawanshahar and gurdaspur and decrease from baseline at ludhiana amritsar bathinda mansa and sangrur under a2 and b2 scenario the rainfall is projected to increase from baseline at all the locations in punjab4952 simulating wheat yields by mid and end 21st century in punjab the dynamic simulation model infocrop was

study revealed that the grain yield of wheat is projected to decrease under a1b scenario for the period 2020 2050 from the baseline by 78 to 118 under maximum temperature change scenario by 18 to 84 under minimum temperature change scenarios and by 121 to 176 under both maximum and minimum temperature change scenarios fig 54 for the period 20702100 the grain yield of wheat under maximum temperature change scenarios is projected to decrease from baseline by 58 to 104 under a1b scenario by 16 to 87 under a2 scenario and by 01 to 10 under b2 scenarios fig 55 under the minimum temperature change scenarios the grain yield of wheat for the period 20702100 is projected to decrease from baseline by 18 to 84 under a1b scenario by 14 to 75 under a2 scenario and by 05 to 41 under b2 scenarios the grain yield of wheat for the period 20702100 under the maximum and minimum temperature interaction change scenarios is projected to decrease from baseline by 05 to 72 under a1b scenario by 136 to 228 under a2 scenario and by 06 to 133 under b2 scenario 53 effect of field elevated temperature regimes on growth and yield of wheat hightemperature stress in plants is a complex function of intensity temperature in degrees duration and rate of increase in temperature the physiological response of plants to temperature stress can be i tolerance due to mechanisms that maintain high metabolic activity under mild stress and reduced activity under severe stress and ii avoidance a reduction of metabolic activity resulting in a dormant state upon exposure to extreme stress 531 temperature gradient tunnel tgt studies at ludhiana the temperature gradient tunnel tgt facility employed in the study is 30 m in length and 5 m in breadth and 3 m in height fig 56 the tgt is a tunnel like structure made up of galvanized iron pipes and covered with polythene sheets which are 500 thick and uv stabilized with transmissivity within the range of 75 80 it has cooling pads at the backside wherein water is sprinkled with the pump to produce a cool draft the two exhaust fans installed at the other end suck in cool air draft from the opposite side thereby producing a gentle gradient of temperature the meteorological data within the tgt is monitored with five temperature and relative humidity sensors and one radiation sensor installed within the 30 m length of the tunnel one set of temperature and relative humidity and radiation sensor are installed outside the temperature gradient tunnel to monitor the ambient air temperature 50and relative humidity data the data is monitored by the data logger delta t devices make at five minutes interval and logged at half an hour interval 532 effect of elevated temperature regimes under tgt environment wheat cultivars viz

on yield attributes the results of the effect of elevated temperature regimes on wheat cultivars under tgt environments for yield attributes ie effective tillers and panicle length are given in figure 57 and 58 respectively temperature stress most adversely affects the effective tillering in wheat as the high temperature results in pollen sterility in wheat cultivars the effective tillering was reduced with an increase in temperature of 30 32 and 36 oc by 10 to 12 by 15 to 24 and by 32 to 47 respectively amongst the wheat cultivars cv hd2967 was most resistant to temperature stress effect on effective tillering whereas cv pbw621 was most sensitive the length of the panicle is an important yield attributing characteristic which is highly vulnerable to high temperature stress in wheat cultivars the panicle length was reduced with an increase in temperature of 30 32 and 36 oc by 15 to 16 by 16 to 20 and by 20 to 30 respectively amongst the wheat cultivars cv pbw550 was most

retardant to growth and final yield of the crop the most critical period in wheat growth has been identified to be from february to march in punjab during the anthesis and grain development heat stress during anthesis increases floret abortion and pollen sterility while during the grain development it can cause tissue dehydration lower co2 assimilation and increased photorespiration one of the oldest methodology for mitigating heat stress in wheat is the application of irrigation field studies were conducted to evaluate the various mitigation techniques flood irrigation water spray urea spray and chemical application to offset the heat stress effect in wheat the results are discussed as follows 541 timing of irrigation application the experiment on wheat in rabi 201213 and 201314 were conducted with wheat variety pbw 621 aicrpamludhiana 2013 and 2014 the crop was sown during first week november 51112 and 71113 and raised as per the recommended package of practices of punjab agricultural university irrigations were applied as per treatments the heat stress was applied by constructing temporary polyhouses inside the polyhouse average daily temperature was 3 oc higher than

of growth parameters is given under no heat stress treatment ho the per cent deviation from no heat and recommended irrigation schedule hoi1 compared with variable stress and irrigation are listed for h1 h2 and h3 treatments in general the application of additional irrigation is able to mitigate the heat stress effect in wheat however the timing of the irrigation application are the real determinant of the magnitude of this positive impact in wheat amongst the various stress treatments the heat stress during 1 st week february resulted in maximum reduction in number of grainsear and the heat stress during 2nd and 3rd week february resulted in maximum reduction in the 1000 grain weight on the other hand heat stress during 1st 2nd and 3rd week february resulted in reduction in weight of grainear and grain yield as the negative impact on any of the yield attributes gets translated into ultimate reduction in the grain productivity the number of grains ear decreased from 156 205 with the imposition of heat stress during 1 st week of february from 14 74 with the imposition of heat stress during 2nd week of february and from 05 13 with the imposition of heat stress during 3rd week of february the reduction in 1000grain weight due to heat stress during 1st week of february ranged from 06 to 41 and that during 2nd week ranged from 51 to 110 and in the 3rd week it ranged from 35 to 105 the weight of grains ear were decreased within the range of 74 231 with the imposition of heat stress during 1st week of february from 23 132 with the imposition of heat stress during 2nd week of february and from 63 238 with the imposition of heat stress during 3rd week of february the reduction in grain yield due to heat stress during 1st week of february ranged from 46 to 190 and that during 2nd week ranged from 06 to 106 and in the 3rd week it ranged from 43 to 230 the irrigations applied before stress or during the heat stress helped in reducing the effect of heat stress the i1 and i2 irrigations were able to mitigate the effect of heat stress imposed during 1st week of february i3 and i4 irrigations were able to mitigate the effect of heat stress imposed during 2nd week of february and i5 and i6 irrigations were able to mitigate the effect of heat stress imposed during 3rd week of february however the irrigations applied after heat stress failed to save the crop from the harmful effects of heat stress ie i 3 irrigation were not able to mitigate the effect of heat stress imposed during 1st week of february i5 irrigation were not able to mitigate the effect of heat stress imposed during 2nd week of february and i7 irrigation were not able to mitigate the effect of heat stress imposed during 3rd week of february61542 application of salicylic acid chemical application is also an important heat stress mitigation strategy in wheat under actual field conditions field experiment on wheat cv pbw621 were conducted in pots during the rabi seasons of 201112 and 201213 aicrpamludhiana 2012 2013 ten seeds were sown and finally 15 days after emergence only two seedlings were retained fertilizers were applied as per the recommended package of practices of punjab agricultural university the pots were irrigated as per need the heat stress treatments were applied by placing the pots in the polyhouse constructed for this purpose the western side of the poly house was kept open during the day to reduce the increase in temperature and during the night all sides were kept closed the average increase in temperature was 3oc inside the polyhouse as compared to

the results of pot experiment to offset the heat stress effect in wheat using salicylic acid are presented in table 52 the results revealed that the grain yield was influenced by the heat stress as well as by spray of salicylic acid in unsprayed treatments the change in grain yield due to heat treatments as compared to control not heated and not sprayed hous ranged between 77 to 157 the change in grain yield in different heat cum sprayed treatments as compared to the control was in the range of 23 to 93 in general heat stress during vegetative phase resulted in a less reduction in grain yield of wheat while high temperature during panicle initiation anthesis and grain development resulted in more decrease in grain yield of wheat as compared to control not heated and not sprayed hous the spray of salicylic acid helped in increasing the grain yield as compared to unsprayed treatments 543 foliar application of water and urea the experiment on wheat in rabi 201213 and 201415 were

wheat is an annual cereal plant of poaceae family it is the secondmost produced crop on the earth and is the most important staple food of 36 of the world population wheat is grown not only in tropical and subtropical zones but also in the temperate zones between 47s and 57n latitude from sea level to an elevation of 3300 m in india its cultivation is spread between 10n to 37n latitudes the optimum temperature range for ideal germination of the seed is 2025c and for vegetative growth of plant is 1622c temperatures above 25c during this period tend to decrease grain weight wheat can be grown successfully in regions where annual rainfall varies from 25 to 150 cm india is the second largest wheat producing nation with area under wheat was 3119 million hectares with production of 9585 million tonnes and yield of 315 tonnes per hectares during 201314 in punjab it occupied an area of 351 million hectares with a production of 1659 million tonnes and productivity of 472 tonnes per hectares during 201213 anonymous 2014 over the past four decades a significant increase in area production and productivity has occurred in all the districts of the punjab state amongst all the districts in the state over the past four decades 197071 to 20092010 in ludhiana district the mean least increase in wheat area was 12 and productivity was 25 and the rate of increase in yield was only 523 kghayear as it has always been the most technologically advanced district of the state wheat is a cool loving plant and its growth period extends from end october to mid april in punjab the analysis of the meteorological parameters showed that the maximum temperature in the range of 161180 oc during january 210 oc during february and 281 300 oc during march were most favourable for optimum wheat yield similarly the minimum temperature in the range of 3150 oc during january 5170 oc during february and 111 130 o c during march were most favourable for wheat yield in the region amongst the various agrometeorological constraints for wheat production in punjab the occurrence of heat wave leading to terminal heat stress is a major retardant of the wheat productivity in the state weather is the most pivotal factor in wheat productivity was proven by the ceres wheat model for wheat crop simulations wherein the yield gap between the actual with controllable and uncontrollable factors as limiting factor and potential yields with only uncontrollable factor as the limiting factor for the wheat were identified and quantified the simulated results revealed that over the past decade the weather variability contributed positively towards wheat yield in agroclimatic zone ii during the crop year 200203 2005 06 200708 and 200910 in agroclimatic zone iii during the crop year 199900 200001 and 200203 and in agroclimatic zone iv during the crop year 200001 200102 200304 to 200506 200708 and 20080967the vegetative and grain development phase for wheat varies from 95107 days and 4553 days respectively for crop sown during 2nd fortnight of october from 96112 days and 4250 days respectively for crop sown during 1st fortnight of november from 89104 days and 4148 days respectively for crop sown during 2nd fortnight of november and from 84100 days and 3540 days respectively in wheat sown during 1st fortnight of december the thermal units accrued during the vegetative phase are maximum for crop sown during 2nd fortnight october 978oc day whereas for grain development phase are maximum for crop sown during 1st fortnight of november 766oc day heat use efficiency hue ie efficiency of utilization of heat in terms of dry matter accumulation is an important aspect of plant growth amongst the commonly sown wheat cultivars in the state cv pbw550 sown during mid october gave highest grain yield hue of 310 kghaoc day whereas wheat cultivar pbw502 sown during mid november yielded highest grain yield hue of 331 kghaoc day today climate change and variability is a global phenomenon and punjab state has also experienced the same the precis providing regional climates for impact studies model has simulated that the annual maximum and minimum temperature in punjab may increase from the baseline by 22 to 29 oc and 13 to 18 oc respectively by 202050 by 17 to 26 oc and 13 to 16 oc respectively by 20702100 under a1b scenario by 06 to 17 oc and 12 to 17 oc respectively by 20702100 under a2 scenario and by 03 to 12 oc and 02 to 06 oc respectively by 20702100 under b2 scenario the infocrop model was run using the precis model simulated weather data for punjab the simulations revealed that the grain yield of wheat is projected to decrease under a1b scenario for the period 20202050 from the baseline by 121 to 176 for the period 20702100 this decrease is projected to be 05 to 72 under a1b scenario by 136 to 228 under a2 scenario and 06 to 133 under b2 scenario crop simulation models are being increasingly used for studying the influence of climatic variability on growth and yield of crops cereswheat model simulations revealed that phenological development of wheat was significantly advanced by increasing temperature but was delayed by decreasing temperature with an increase in temperature by 10 to 20 oc the simulated grain yield decreased by 98 to 180 but with decrease in temperature increased by 71 to 73 from normal the intraseasonal temperature increase in 2 nd fortnight of february and 1st fortnight of march decreased the grain yield of the early normal and late sown wheat crops the simulated increase in solar radiation by 50 resulted in increase in grain yield in wheat by 36 from normal and similar decrease in solar radiation reduced the grain yield by 38 from normal the interactive effects of increasing temperature and decreasing radiation revealed a cumulative adverse effect on growth and yield of the wheat crop the 68interactive effects of increasing co2 concentration and increasing temperature on wheat growth and yield revealed that increasing co2 levels were able to counteract the adverse effects of temperature increase on growth and yield to some extent under the temperature increase of 20 oc from normal and co2 concentration of 600 ppm increased the grain yield by 56 from normal the effect of elevated temperature regimes on wheat cultivars were studied under field conditions using a temperature gradient tunnel tgt 30 m in length and 5 m in breadth and 3 m in height facility the results of the study revealed that the grain yield of wheat cultivars were reduced with an increase in temperature by 30 32 35 and 36 oc by 13 to 18 19 to 27 38 to 42 and 41 to 47 respectively in general the effect of variable elevated temperature regimes effect on grain yield of the wheat cultivars revealed that cv hd2967 was most resistant mean reduction by 29 followed by cv pbw621 mean reduction by 31 and cv pbw550 mean reduction by 32 was most vulnerable heat stress is a major abiotic constraint for wheat production in the state the heat stress applied during 1st week february resulted in maximum reduction in number of grainsear and for 2nd and 3rd week february resulted in maximum reduction in the 1000 grain weight on the other hand heat stress during 1st to 3rd week february resulted in reduction in weight of grainear and grain yield irrigation is commonly employed for mitigating heat stress in wheat however the timing of the irrigation application is the real determinant of the magnitude of this positive impact the irrigations applied before or during the heat stress helped in reducing the effect of heat stress however the irrigations applied after heat stress failed to save the crop from the harmful effects of heat stress the spray of chemicals such as salicylic acid and foliar application of urea also helped in increasing the grain yield of wheat experiencing heat stress the foliar application of water during the grain filling period in wheat is also able to offset the heat stress under elevated temperature regimes 69references aicrpamludhiana 2002 all india coordinated research project on agrometeorology annual report of ludhiana center
