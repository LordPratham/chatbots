and its linkages to poverty alleviation in six selected states of india namely bihar uttar pradesh up odisha punjab gujarat and madhya pradesh mp there has been low to moderate growth in agriculture in bihar up and odisha over the period 200001 to 201415 punjab has been the seat of the green revolution and was a frontrunner in agriculture during the late 1960s but has slipped to low levels of agricultural growth in the recent past gujarat and madhya pradesh have shown some extraordinary growth in their agriculture sectors almost three times the allindia agricultural growth rate in the last decade or so the key idea of this study was to look for policy lessons from each other within indian context and see how to propel growth in agriculture for faster alleviation of poverty we would like

lessonsiiiabstract punjab has been a star performer in agriculture during heydays of the green revolution agriculture in punjab grew at a high growth rate of 57 per cent during 197172 to 198586 which was more than double the allindia growth rate 231 per cent during this period it was this spectacular performance of punjab first witnessed in large wheat surpluses followed by steep rise in production of rice which helped india free itself from the pl 480 food aid and its associated political strings punjab played a crucial role in achieving the much needed food security for india however the state slipped soon after and grew at a lower rate of about 3 per cent between 198687 and 200405 equivalent to the allindia agricultural growth rate the situation has deteriorated further as punjabs agriculture gdp grew at only 161 per cent per annum which is less than half the allindia average growth rate of 35 per cent in the period between 200506 and 201415 it is intriguing what led to the sharp deceleration of agriculture growth in punjab and what sort of policy intervention is required to put it back on a high growth path the landslide victory of the congress party in the state assembly election offers hope to change the fate of punjabs agriculture in this paper we study the composition sources and drivers of agricultural growth that had contributed to the high growth of agriculture in punjab until 198586 the study finds that among the many steps taken by the state three interventions played the most important role in the states impressive performance in agriculture they are irrigation facilities allweather roads to provide rural connectivity and assured market for agricultural produce but the state has already achieved the best position in technology and infrastructure development and there is no real scope left to expand these areas the future of punjabs agricultural prosperity lies in the highvalue sectors of agriculture the study makes three sets of recommendations to stimulate agricultural growth in punjab viz 1 encouraging diversification from common rice in the kharif season by moving on to maize for poultry feed silage and starch industries promoting fruits and vegetables to at least 10 percent of gca including their protected cultivation through drips etc with an eye on export markets of the gulf countries 2 encouraging processing industries by liberalising land lease markets developing contract farming rationalising tax structure on raw commodities especially wheat and rice and revisiting tax rates approved by gst council for processed food under new gst regime 3 promoting sustainable agriculture by shifting to dbt with respect to power and fertiliser subsidy so that inefficiencies in the use of power and fertilisers can be minimised as also propagating micro irrigation techniques and encouraging the use of solar power for powering irrigation pumps and generating solar power as the third crop keywords

drivers and policy lessonsivexecutive summary punjab was the frontrunner of agriculture performance during the glorious days of green revolution despite the states small geographical area 15 per cent of the total area of the country the gsdp from agriculture increased at 57 per cent per annum in the period of 197172 to 198586 which is more than double of 231 per cent allindia growth in the same period it was this stellar performance of punjab first witnessed in large wheat surpluses and then similar rise in rice production which helped india free itself from the pl 480 food aid and its associated political strings punjab became a symbol of grain surpluses giving india the much needed food security thanks to the earlier years of high agrigrowth punjab had one of the lowest poverty ratios 77 percent in rural punjab in the country in 201112 as per tendulkar poverty line which was almost onethird of the levels of poverty at all india level these have been the most commendable achievements of punjab but lately punjabs agriculture growth plummeted to just 16 per cent per annum during 200506 to 201415 which was less than half the allindia agrigdp growth of 35 percent over the same period the question arises is where did punjab go wrong and what sort of policy revival is needed to get back to high growth path of more than 5 percent per annum in agriculture and overall gsdp of more than the national average of 78 percent per annum say for the next 10 to 15 years with 77 seats in the 117member assembly congress has set up a historic victory in the 2017 assembly election this can bring a significant change in punjabs agriculture if the promises made in the election manifesto are honoured in spirit the most notable of them are agricultural sustainable programme free soil testing 80 per cent subsidy on drip and sprinkler irrigation and solar energy incentives on alternative crops special incentives for the agroprocessing sector input tax waiver establishment of food parks and dbt of subsidy to the farmers in this paper we have used secondary data published by the govt of india and state government to study the composition sources and drivers of agriculture growth in punjab cereals constitute the major share of 427 per cent in the gross value of output from agriculture and allied activities followed by livestock 286 per cent in te 201314 in the 14year period between 200001 and 201314 the value of output from agriculture and allied activities in punjab increased at an average annual rate of 271 per cent in 200405 prices decomposing this growth into various sectors cereals contributed 389 per cent to this growth livestock contributed 317 per cent while fruits and vegetables contributed 154 per cent to growth despite its small share in the gvoa agriculture growth is impacted by a host of factors which can be classified at least in three distinct sets i technology irrigation fertiliser consumption seed replacement ratio farm mechanisation ii price incentive terms of trade minimum support price and iii infrastructure electricity roads mandis etc besides these there could also be factors that impact the institutional setting of agrisector such as land markets land lease laws marketing laws essential commodities act eca and agriculture produce marketing act apmc contract farming laws etc in a simple econometric regression model taking log gsdp as the dependent variable and the above mentioned three sets of quantifiable variables as independent variables in log form with data from 197071 to 201415 we estimate the following equation y to1 x12 x2 3 x3 1 here x1 is irrigation ratio x2 is terms of trade between agriculture and industry and x3 is surfaced road densitygetting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessonsvthe estimated equation gives the following results1 gsdpa 77 347irr 035tot 037srd 797 443 432 adj rsquare 097 what this equation implies is that 97 percent of the growth in agriculture during this period 197071 to 201415 can be explained by expansion of irrigation ratio road density and price incentives tot with irrigation having played the most important role the state has performed very well in terms of high input use and infrastructure development and it set an example for many other states the state successfully brought 985 per cent of the gross cropped area under irrigation which is commendable the road infrastructure in punjab is among the most developed in india transport facilities enhance the interaction between different agents starting at the farm level to household consumption level it becomes even more crucial when it comes to perishable agricultural commodities road density in punjab has increased from 564 per thousand sq km in 197071 to around 2271 per thousand sq km in 201415 further surfaced road as a percentage of total roads is 87 percent in punjab one of the highest in the country unlike decreasing size of land holding at all india level punjab has experienced increase in operational land holding over the years average land holding size has increased from 289 ha in 197071 to 377 ha in 201011 the share of wheat and rice procurement in total production is highest in the country there may be no real scope for further improvement in these factors therefore in order to bring agricultural growth in punjab back on track we must look to other sectors that could lead to high agricultural growth in the future this combination of highest irrigation cover one of the best road densities in the country and increasing holding size places punjab in a very fortunate situation to get its agriculture back to growing at more than 5 percent per annum for another decade or more provided it follows right mix of policies and incentives diversification from common rice the most significant problem of punjab has been free power leading to massive depletion of water table as cropping patterns leaned towards paddy as a result water table is going down at an alarming rate 70cms per year during 200812 and currently 80 per cent of the blocks are overexploited encouraging diversification away from common rice in the kharif season by moving on to maize for poultry feed as corn along with soybean is the most important ingredient of feed in the poultry industry silage and starch industries promoting fruits and vegetables to at least 10 percent of gca including their protected cultivation through micro irrigation etc with an eye on export markets of the gulf countries will boost the agriculture in the state encouraging food processing industries agriculture is going to stay as the backbone of farmers for another 1015 years in punjab it can build on this core competence by linking agriculture to food processing sector adding value creating jobs in rural areas and increasing farmers incomes the state can emerge as a hub for units using wheat as raw material like flour mills noodles and pasta manufacturing biscuits and bakery etc but all these years wheat based processing units always felt unenthusiastic to buy wheat from punjab due to very high taxes and statutory levies which touched 145 per cent under new gst regime the vat of 5 per cent will be abolished and there will be no gst on food grains 1 numbers in the parentheses are t valuesgetting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessonsviwith abolition of high taxes punjab can again become attractive to private trade to purchase grains instead of buying them from other states there is also an opportunity now to attract food processing industry which can benefit farmers and create employment however under the new gst regime taxation structure approved by gst council for processed food is too high the centre may reconsider these rates and bring them down to the 5 per cent slab promote sustainable agriculture especially with respect to water use efficiency the most critical problem of punjab agriculture is its depleting water table primarily due to paddy cultivation during kharif season fertiliser consumption is also skewed toward highly subsidised urea we recommend promoting sustainable agriculture by shifting to dbt with respect to power and fertiliser subsidy so that inefficiencies in their use can be minimised as also propagating micro irrigation techniques and encouraging the use of solar power for powering irrigation pumps and generating solar power as the third crop overall the strategy for punjab agriculture needs to shift from food security concerns of the country to sustainable agriculture practices coupled with income augmentation of punjab farmers we are confident that with this shift in strategy the state can turn around its agricultural growth back to more than 5 percent per annum increase farmers incomes and use its precious water resources in a more sustainable manner getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons1 1 introduction punjab has been a star performer in agriculture during heydays of green revolution its agriculture gdp grew at 57 per cent per annum during 1971 72 to 198586 which was more than double the growth rate of 231 per cent achieved at allindia level during the same period it was this spectacular performance of punjab first observed in large wheat surpluses and then in rice which helped india free itself from the pl 480 food aid and its associated political strings punjab became a symbol of indias grain surpluses giving india a much needed food security but after 198586 green revolution started greying and growth in punjab agriculture slowed down to 3 percent per annum over the period 1985 86 to 200405 almost same as achieved at all india level but the real challenges to punjab agriculture emerged when its growth crashed down to just 16 per cent per annum during 200506 to 201415 which was less than half the allindia agrigdp growth of 35 percent over the same period owing to the earlier years of high agrigrowth that punjab had one of the lowest poverty ratios 77 percent in rural punjab in the country in 201112 as per tendulkar poverty line which was almost onethird of the levels of poverty at all india level providing food security to the country and reducing its own poverty to lowest levels within all india context have been the most laudable achievements of punjab but lately as a result of its decelerating agrigrowth punjab has lost its preeminent position of being the state with highest per capita income in india a title it carried since its inception in 1966 till 200203 in 2014 15 eg punjab stood at the 7th position in per capita income amongst 21 major states of india and if current growth trends continue it wont be a surprise that punjab slips further down in this hierarchy of large indian states in terms of its per capita income that raises some fundamental questions where did punjab go wrong and how can it get back to high growth path of more than 5 percent per annum in agriculture and overall gsdp of more than the national average of 78 percent per annum say for the next 10 to 15 years it is precisely these questions that we try to address in this study on punjab agriculture identifying its sources and drivers of growth and how best to accelerate its agrigrowth the paper is organised in six sections as follows agriculture in punjab trends in agricultural growth composition and sources of agricultural growth plausible determinants of agriculture growth technology infrastructure development incentives and institutions econometric analysis for drivers of agriculture growth conclusion and policy recommendationgetting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons2 2 methodology the study has used timeseries secondary data compiled from various published sources of government of india and government of punjab covering the period 199091 to 201415 we have analysed the composition of agriculture by calculating the share of value of output from different segments as a percentage of total value of output from agriculture and allied activities at current prices to calculate the sources of growth the current series of value of output of each segment is deflated by the wpi of all commodities at 200405 prices then yearonyear growth of each segment is calculated by taking the absolute yearonyear difference in gvo from each segment as a proportion of previous years gvo from agriculture and allied activities further in the paper we have used a simple ordinary least square model to identify the drivers of growth we have considered a longer time period of 197071 to 201415 for the regression analysis to identify the drivers of growth during the green revolution period we also performed a unit root test on the residuals of the model to determine if it is stationary the null hypothesis in the englegranger procedure is no cointegrationgetting punjab

chenab jhelum ravi and sutlej after the partition of india in 1947 punjab was divided between india and pakistan along religious lines indian punjab was again divided in 1966 on a linguistic basis giving birth to a truncated punjab after the formation of haryana and himachal pradesh as separate states present day punjab is situated in the northern part of india bordered by jammu and kashmir to the north himachal pradesh to the east haryana to the south and rajasthan to the southwest punjab has an area of 50362 square kilometres which is 15 per cent of the total geographical area of the country it extends from the latitudes 2930 0 north to 32320 north and longitudes 73550 east to 76500 east the subtropical location leads to variation in temperature and punjab experiences three main seasons hot season rainy season and cold season the monsoon season provides most of the rainfall in punjab punjab has been divided into five agroclimatic zones on the basis of homogeneity rainfall pattern cropping pattern etc the zones are submountain undulating zone undulating plain zone central plain zone western plain zone and western zone the state has hilly areas in the north covering 20

problem of water logging and soil salinity the affected districts include muktsar fazilka bathinda and faridkot according to the goi report of the high level expert group on water logging in punjab an area is said to be waterlogged when the water table rises to such an extent that the soil pores in the root zone of a crop becomes saturated resulting in restriction of normal air decline in the level of oxygen and increase in the level of carbon dioxide many farmers have lost their livelihood in these areas as their agricultural land becomes unproductive burning of paddy straw has been identified

cultivation it was made possible by the provision of extensive irrigation facilities and procurement of paddy at msp because of an assured market rice production increased over the years however rice is not the staple food in punjab and rice procured in punjab is transported to states in the east north east and south india this imposes an additional cost of storage and transportation as rice is the most remunerative kharif crop owing to the assured msp farmers prefer to grow rice over other crops like maize or pulses thus food procurement policy in punjab is also responsible for the change in cropping pattern which is having an impact on the environment the policy which worked as a catalyst of growth in punjabs agriculture has become detrimental to the sustainability of its agriculture specializing in cereals was great when india was suffering from food shortages however the situation today is different central pool stock of cereals crossed 80 million mt in july 2012 way above the buffer stock norm some of the state specific policies in punjab have also been distorting the market mechanism the punjab government charges heavy commissionleviescess on the purchase of wheat and rice amounting to 145 per cent which is much higher than the 2 per cent in gujarat and west bengal this makes the food processing industry extremely reluctant to buy their raw material from punjab in fact there have been instances of flour millers from punjab buying wheat from up revenue from these taxeslevies accrues to the mandi board or the state government in the new gst regime the tax structure has been rationalised by gst council as most agricommodities like rice wheat fv and milk fall in the zero tax slab in punjab if we assume that only the arhatiya commission of 25 per cent will stay all other taxes and cesses will disappear and purchase cost may decline by 12 per cent subsequently private sector may find punjab an attractive source which will boost grain milling however it is still not clear if market fee rural development fund and infrastructure development cess will be subsumed in gst 632 agricultural marketing the punjab state agricultural marketing board now punjab mandi board was established in 1961 to control and oversee the marketing network for the sale procurement storage and processing of agricultural produce punjab emerged as a success story in developing an efficient market infrastructure the major thrust of the state government has been on providing well organised market infrastructure linking all the villages to the market with surfaced road and grading of agricultural produce in mandis major investment has been made to improve the connectivity of villages currently there are 98 mandis in punjab and farmers do not have to travel getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons30 long distances to market their produce punjab mandi board but after the implementation of agricultural produce market regulation act during the green revolution no significant reforms have been undertaken chand 2017 and agricultural markets are characterised by inefficiency the presence of middlemen price manipulation and so on agricultural marketing is a state subject and it requires initiative from the state government to undertake serious reforms as part of agriculture marketing reform the prime minister launched the electronic trading platform for national agricultural market enam on april 14 2016 however the punjab government has not opted to join the enam platform even though its neighbour has enam will bring transparency to operations in mandis and the details of arhatiyas and farmers as well as participants in auctions in mandis will be captured online it will also enable direct payment of msp and sale price to farmers bank accounts while the commission of arhatiyas can be directly credited to their account therefore punjab should join enam and ensure transparency in operations of mandis and arhatiyas although punjab was the first state to build a good marketing infrastructure for wheat and paddy it has not been successful in providing similar facilities for perishable products like fruits and vegetables in most mandis maize dryers are not available due to which farmers bring maize with high moisture content that deprives them of a remunerative price for maize volatility in prices increases the risk of farmers and they feel discouraged to shift to high value horticulture 633 agricultural credit credit plays an important role in agricultural growth especially when farming becomes highly capital intensive of the total loans of rural households 64 per cent and 36 per cent have been advanced by institutional and noninstitutional sources respectively nsso aidis 201213 loans advanced by commercial banks are the major source of credit in india as well as in punjab in punjab commercial banks account for 80 per cent of the total

agro foodgrains corporation pafc was established in 2002 as the nodal agency for dealing with contract farming in the state the corporation has a tie up with a set of companies providing inputs credits extension services and buy back arrangements pafc in its first phase identified crops like maize sunflower hybrid rapeseed basmati durum wheat barley and moong for contract farming area under contract farming increased from 9 thousand ha in 2002 to 102 thousand ha in 200607 but since 201112 pafc has only undertaken contract farming of barley httpwwwpunjabagrogovinpafccfarminghtml accessed on 3062017 there are some instances of firms having direct arrangement with the farmers as well the firms provided inputsextension services and also bought the end products the success of contract farming lies in long term commitment and mutual trust between firms and farmers refusal to purchase low market price put the farmers in a difficult situation nestle was successful in sustaining its partnership with the farmers for purchase of milk but similar kind of success was not achieved for horticulture in april 2013 the punjab assembly passed the punjab contract farming act the idea was to facilitate direct purchase of farm produce so that farmers can realise better price the salient features of the act were as under the punjab contract farming act 2013 punjab govt gaz extra chtr 26

delivery or a delayed payment with interest is allowed up to 30 days h district collector will deal with the dispute between farmers and firms both partys interest has been protected in the new act but rules under the act were not notified and the act has not been operationalised contract farming undertaken by pafc is also not registered under the act the state govt needs to formulate the rules under this act without any further delay so that high value agriculture can be promoted through contract farming coupled with assured protection to the farmers 635 incentives for food processing industries the previous govt announced a number of fiscal incentives in its 2013 policy on fiscal incentives for industrial promotion the detailed incentives are presented in the annexure4 there is need to ensure that the incentives listed in the policy are actually available to food processing units being set up in the state however under the new gst regime taxation structure for processed food finalised by the gst council is not very encouraging fruits and vegetable juices are to be taxed at 12 per cent while jams jellies purees etc will be taxed at even higher rate of 18 per cent this will weaken the linkages between farmers and the food processing industry and the expected growth of high value agriculture will not be realised the centre may reconsider these rates getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons32 7 econometric analysis for drivers of agricultural growth the performance of the agricultural sector is influenced by several supply side factors as discussed above the broad ones being the technological development infrastructure facilities and price incentives through institutions it is difficult to analyse the effect of all the variables in a simple framework because these variables would affect agricultural performance through various mechanisms in this section we make an attempt to find out the drivers of agricultural growth in punjab through a simple econometric model for the model we have taken one representative factor from the three broad areas to assess its impact on agricultural growth for example fertiliser consumption and irrigation infrastructure are both crucial for agriculture but are highly correlated and hence cannot be taken in the same equation due to multicollinearity annexure table 9 gives the correlation matrix of the variables keeping aside this limitation it is observed that gsdpa shows a significant and positive correlation with irrigation terms of trade between agriculture and industry and surfaced road densitythe function is defined y t o1 x12 x2 3 x3 1 here x1 is irrigation ratio x2 is terms of trade between agriculture and industry and x3 is surfaced road density in our model logarithmic value of gsdpa is the dependent variable and the above mentioned variables in logarithm are the independent variables the equation has been estimated using data from 197071 to 201415 we have run the model with different variables and have presented only those variables that have a significant effect on agriculture gdp the estimated equation is as follows 4 gsdpa

industry sector for punjab srd log of surfaced road length per thousand sq km of areagetting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons33 the effect of irrigation road and tot are found to be significant in the model irrigation turned out to be the most significant factor affecting agrigdp since we have used a doublelog model the result indicates that a one per cent growth in the irrigation ratio increases agricultural gsdp by 35 per cent it implies unconstrained supply of water is very important for cultivation and ensuring irrigation has helped the sector flourish similarly one per cent increase in terms of trade in favour of agriculture increased agriculture gsdp by 035 per cent price policy plays a significant role in driving the sector and remunerative prices persuade the farmers to take on higher investment a strong marketing infrastructure and procurement facilities ensured that farmers can avail accurate prices for their produce roads as well play a major role in agricultural development as through roads farmers are connected to input and output markets one per cent increase in surfaced density leads to 037 per cent increase in gsdp from agriculture what this equation implies is that 97 percent of the growth in agriculture during this period can be explained by expansion of irrigation ratio road density and price incentives tot the detailed correlation matrix is given in the annexure annexure 9stationarity and causality it is crucial to note that time series data have a common tendency of growing over time many times two time series processes turn out to be correlated because they are both trending over time caused by other unobserved factors this may lead to spurious correlation between the dependent

levelgetting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons34 8 conclusion and policy recommendations the econometric analysis in the previous section highlights the three factors that have been the drivers of agricultural growth in punjab in the past i expanded irrigation through tube wells ii assured remunerative prices for wheat and rice and iii expansion of all weather roads however the growth that could be achieved by developing roads irrigation and markets has already been realized and exhausted the state has successfully brought 985 per cent of the gross cropped area under irrigation which is commendable the road infrastructure in punjab is among the most developed in india transport facilities enhance the interaction between different agents starting at the farm level to household consumption level this is particularly critical to facilitate the movement of perishable agricultural commodities road density in punjab has increased from 564 per thousand sq km in 197071 to around 2271 per thousand sq km in 2014 15 further surfaced road as a percentage of total roads is 87 per cent in punjab one of the highest in the country the share of wheat and rice procurement in total production is also the highest in the country there is no real scope for further improvement in these areas therefore in order to bring agricultural growth in punjab back on track and get it growing at more than 5 per cent per annum for another decade or more we must look to other sectors that could lead to high agricultural growth in the future the future of punjabs agricultural prosperity lies in the highvalue sectors of agriculture the combination of highest irrigation cover one of the best road infrastructures in the country and increasing holding size places punjab in a privileged position what is required now is a correct mix of demand driven policies and incentives the most significant problem of punjab has been free power leading to huge depletion of water table as cropping pattern inclined towards more paddy the johl committee report 1986 had recommended a shift away from wheatrice cropping pattern to wheatmaize one which still remains valid punjab famers have not diversified from rice to other kharif crops in the absence of equivalent incentives we make the following three sets of policy suggestions as the way forward for the agricultural sector in punjab diversification from common rice a diversification to maize currently 013 million hectare area is under maize cultivation in punjab which is 165 per cent of the gca the area under maize cultivation can be expanded by linking it to the processing industry for food and feed especially poultry maize is used in many ways and these different uses should be explored to generate a market for different maize products i fodder conservation maize constitutes a primary ingredient for poultry feed in india it can also be used as feed for dairy animals silage preparation is a scientific way of storing green fodder for dairy animals it helps in supplying fodder for dairy animals on a large scale during periods of scarcity seasons without any loss of nutrients the criteria for forage to be used as silage include high level of fermentable sugar low level of protein and low buffering capacity on the basis of these criteria maize oat bajra sorghum lemon grass etc are considered suitable for silage making in anaerobic conditions without air sugar contained in green fodder is converted into lactic acid with the help of micro organism which helps preserve the green fodder for a longer period of time it is a time and labour saving technology compared to the traditional way as fodder cutting transport and chaffing is done only once making it economically viable although india is ranked first in milk production in the world the productivity of animals is not satisfactory good quality forages make a huge differ ence in milk productivity 50 per cent increase in productivity an adult milch animal needs 35 kg of getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons35 fodder and according to indian grassland and fodder research institute 2010 the country faces a net defi cit of 356 per cent in green fodder as livestock con tributes almost 30 per cent of the total value of output in punjab and the state is the fifth largest producer of milk in the country the demand for fodder is very high in the state as it is in neighbouring haryana and uttar pradesh silage making is a technology that can allow farmers to provide quality roughage throughout the year in india hay making was the traditional method of forage preservation but silage making is a technologically advanced method that is not dependent on weather conditions and a variety of crops can be used in some pockets of punjab silage making has successfully been adopted while 1 acre of land ensures rs 22000rs 25000 income production of maize provides an income of rs 45000 when farmers are linked to silage making the cost of making one kg of green fodder is only rs 312kg and it is usually sold at rs 5kg adult cattle require 35kg of fodder per day a mini dairy with 10 cattle and 5 calves will require 150 tonnes of green fodder per year dairy knowledge portal nddb there are 50 community based silage pits established in hoshiarpur and gurdaspur with 100 per cent subsidy from milkfed but it needs to be scaled up currently 540 thousand hectares of area is under fodder cultivation in punjab bahfs 2010 area under common rice can be replaced with maize and farmers can directly be involved in silage making the state can emerge as the feedhub of northern india ii other uses of corn cornmeal it is prepared by grinding whole corn it is used as a replacement for wheat flour and is used in baked food products like pizza tortilla corn bread and so on corn syrup it is used as a substitute of sugar in many products like soda candy cookies etccorn oil it is produced by squeezing the germs of the corn and is used as a food ingredient ethanol ethanol fuel or biofuel is made by distilling corn it is a renewable resource and regular gasoline powered cars are run on gas blended with ethanol pharmaceuticals preferred carbohydrate sources in antibiotics are corn syrup and corn starch over 85 different types of antibiotics are produced using corn industrial products industrial products made from corn include absorbents for oil and hazardous waste insecticides fertiliser industrial glue etc alcoholic drinks corn is the major source of carbohydrate in whiskey productiontoothpaste sorbitol produced from corn is used in toothpaste thus corn and its byproducts have many uses the fast growing middle and high income classes and changes in taste and preferences have led to an expansion in the market for processed foods which offers new opportunities for the state to explore in order to tap these opportunities the state needs to strengthen the value chain infrastructure value chain is a vehicle by which new forms of production technologies and logistics are introduced the government should facilitate diversification away from rice towards maize and horticulture by creating the infrastructure for value chain development maize production can be incentivised by developing maize value chains connecting farmers to feed producers processed food industries making cornflakes popcorn or food marts selling horticulture products like baby corn and sweet corn and producer of corn oil and ethanol the maize crop faces marketing problem because it contain more moisture 2028 per cent than the optimal level 14 per cent required for processing so farmers are sometimes forced to accept a lower price government needs to provide proper infrastructure facilities including maize dryers in mandis some mandis have been provided maize dryers out of rkvy funds but not all mandis in maize growing areas are equipped with dryers these problems need to be addressed on prioritygetting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons36 b promotion of livestock sector similarly milk processing needs to be promoted aggressively by the state government although punjab has the highest per capita per day availability of milk 980 grams day in the country currently only 10 per cent of the total milk production of the state is processed by the organised sector cooperatives and private players which is very low compared to gujarat 49 per cent government should provide incentives to the private sector to improve milk processing in the state and set up several plants to process at least 3035 per cent of the total production in the coming 5 years moreover only 30 per cent of the total milk procured by verka is converted into milk products this share should be increased as sale of milk products generates more profit than liquid milk linking maize farmers with the dairy sector will help increase milk production through the supply of quality feed but the abundance of liquid milk will put a downward pressure on its price the government should incentivise the setting up milk processing units following the example of amul the dairy sector in punjab should target the market in the middle east currently marginal and small farmers are the major players in the dairy sector hence the formation of fpos should be encouraged by the state government punjab can also make rearing of cattle more profitable to farmers through its vibrant dairy sector but also developing meat processing especially buffaloes as an export oriented industry farmers who want to sell their bufflaloes for slaughter can fetch a better price for their nonmilching buffaloes healthy buffaloes if the state is declared free from foot and mouth disease c promotion of horticulture the state government needs to realise that growth in income through cereals has reached saturation and there is urgent need for value addition from high value dairy fruits and vegetables only 36 per cent of punjabs gca is under fruit and vegetable production compared to 83 per cent at the allindia level in order to promote the fruit and vegetable sector protected cultivation should be promoted using drip and sprinkler irrigation but it has to be backed by proper processing grading and packaging infrastructure government should aim to bring at least 10 per cent of cropped area under fv in the next five years d fisheries large parts of muktsar fazilka bathinda and faridkot are waterlogged a study by gadvasu has found that fresh water carps can successfully be reared in the saline water hence it provides a good opportunity to develop fisheries in these districts as it can offer alternative employment opportunities but quality fish seed production has remained stagnant in punjab while it has increased steadily in neighbouring haryana the government should take steps to overcome these shortcomings through capital assistance to construct fish seed mills and carp fish seed farms encouraging food processing industries food processing sector should be the focus area in punjab and farmers should be linked to the processing units the abundance of wheat and milk suggests development of bakeries flour mills pasta manufacturing and other processing units which use wheat as raw material punjabs role in feeding central pool for pds should gradually come down it will be taken up by other upcoming states like madhya pradesh and uttar pradesh due to high taxes 145 per cent on wheat the processing industry has been reluctant to buy wheat from punjab in the past private sector units located in punjab itself have preferred to buy wheat from neighbouring uttar pradesh which seems more attractive due to lower taxes and is also cheaper at times due to nonpayment of msp under gst reform it is hoped that these taxes and levies will get rationalised as most raw agricommodities fall in the zero tax slab reduction in taxes and cesses by 12 per cent will reduce price of these basic staples in the open market the state should take it up as an opportunity to build a vibrant wheat processing industry and getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons37 basmati creating employment and linking farmers directly to processors special focus should be given to improve the value chain infrastructure from farm to fork in the state otherwise perishable nature of the products makes farming risky and farmers are reluctant to shift from cereals to fruits and vegetables expressway linking khanna to kandla can minimise the transportation time and the state can totally exploit the opportunities offered by gulf market through speedy transportation of fv to middle east using cargo planes but high taxes on processed food items under the new gst regime will hamper the high value agriculture fv dairy and there is an urgent need to reconsider these rates and bring down to the 5 per cent slab contract farming is still not taken up in large scale in the state the state needs to operationalise contract farming act 2013 to incentivise contract farming by corporate agencies and to promote the food processing industry in the state promote sustainable agriculture especially with respect to water use efficiency a shift to dbt with respect to power subsidy electricity subsidy is an important component of subsidies that were introduced to increase agricultural growth and farm incomes although it has led to assured incomes the combination of free water power and procurement has led to rapid ground water depletion electricity consumption per hectare of agricultural land has increased over time whereas agricultural production per unit of electricity consumption has not increased with free power supply rather it has been falling over time this indicates serious inefficiency in the consumption of electricity in punjabs agricultural sector and steps need to be taken to curtail this for improving power and water use efficiency power supply should be metered and charged beyond a fixed level of free supply and the subsidy currently rs 6236 crore in 201213 should be transferred to farmers bank account transferring a fixed amount of cash calculated using the average land holding to farmers will provide an incentive to reduce the consumption both of electricity and underground water b shift to dbt with respect to fertiliser subsidy another problem faced by agriculture in punjab arises from the imbalance in the use of fertilisers wheat and rice are the most nutrient exhaustive crops and the monocropping of paddy and wheat in the past four decades has led to steady decline of macro npk as well as micro zinc iron manganese nutrients the state has encouraged the use of chemical fertilisers through subsidies and the economic cost is estimated at rs 7022 crore in 201213 hence it has become a vicious circle of higher use of fertilisers and low soil fertility the fertiliser subsidy has helped achieve self sufficiency in food grain production but it has led to inefficient use of fertilisers the extremely low price of urea has resulted in imbalanced use of fertilizers biased towards urea which has an impact on the fertility of land the npk ratio in punjab is 368741 which indicated highly skewed use of urea studies have shown that gulati et al 2015 this imbalance in the use of fertilisers can be corrected by switching to direct cash transfer to farmers on a per hectare basis farmers should be incentivised to get soil tested and get soil health card by linking these to direct cash transfers moreover import duty on urea should be reduced to zero and prices should be determined by market forces c propagating micro irrigation technique realising the gravity of the ground water situation the state govt must consider making it mandatory for sugarcane farmers to use drip irrigation facilities karnataka has already done it and maharashtra is also considering a similar system out of 10 lakh ha under sugarcane in maharashtra about 25 lakh ha is already under drip irrigation modern drip irrigation systems use computerised sensors that regulate the flow of water depending on temperature humidity and nutrient levels in the soil moreover water reaches the root of plant leading to better plant growth the getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons38 automated systems ensure optimum use of water if the government of punjab takes sugar mills on board it should not be difficult to persuade farmers to install drip irrigation systems over a period of two or three years there are pilots being conducted in punjab for drip irrigation in paddy these need to be closely monitored and encouraged the manufacturers of drip equipment claim that using drip irrigation leads to savings of 65 per cent in the case of water and 45 per cent in the case of electricity while improving crop productivity by 40 per cent as compared to flow irrigation micro irrigation means more crop per drop d sustainable futuristic agricultural development another important way to deal with power shortage is to promote solar power for powering irrigation pumps and generating solar power as the third crop by enabling farmers to sell surplus power to the state grid this will help check depleting water tables too cold storages based on solar power can be more cost effective beginning should be made in case of potato cold storages in jalandhar overall strategy for punjab agriculture needs to shift from food security concerns of the country to income augmentation of punjab farmers this can be done by gradually shifting towards high value fv protected cultivation focusing on food processing industry to add value to wheat rice and milk production in the state the strategy also needs to be demand driven plate to plough exploring new and remunerative markets as in gulf countries or even beyond to europe and cis countries we are confident that with this shift in strategy the state can turn around its agriculture growth back to more than 5 percent per annum augment farmers incomes and use its precious water resources in a more sustainable manner getting punjab agriculture back on high growth path sources drivers and policy lessons39 references agriculture policies for
